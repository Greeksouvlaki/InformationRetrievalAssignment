        "content": "\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes several television series, short films, digital series, and literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.\n\nMarvel Studios releases its films in groups called \"Phases\", with the first three phases collectively known as \"The Infinity Saga\" and the following three phases as \"The Multiverse Saga\". The first MCU film, Iron Man (2008), began Phase One, which culminated in the 2012 crossover film The Avengers. Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and concluded with Ant-Man (2015), while Phase Three began with Captain America: Civil War (2016) and concluded with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Black Widow (2021) is the first film in Phase Four, which concluded with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022), while Phase Five began with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) and will conclude with Thunderbolts* (2025). Phase Six will begin with The Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025) and it will conclude with Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027).\n\nMarvel Television expanded the universe to network television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in 2013 before further expanding to streaming television on Netflix and Hulu and to cable television on Freeform. They also produced the digital series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot (2016). Marvel Studios began producing their own television series for streaming on Disney+, starting with WandaVision in 2021 as the beginning of Phase Four. That phase also saw the studio expand to television specials, known as Marvel Studios Special Presentations, starting with Werewolf by Night (2022). The MCU includes various tie-in comics published by Marvel Comics, a series of direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots from 2011 to 2014, and viral marketing campaigns for some films featuring the faux news programs WHIH Newsfront (2015–16) and The Daily Bugle (2019–2022).\n\nThe franchise has been commercially successful, becoming one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time, and it has received generally positive reviews from critics. The studio attributed several Multiverse Saga projects performing below expectations to the increase in the amount of content being produced after the 2019 film Avengers: Endgame, and began decreasing its content output from 2024. The MCU has inspired other film and television studios to attempt similar shared universes and has also inspired several themed attractions, an art exhibit, television specials, literary material, multiple tie-in video games, and commercials.\n\nBy 2005, Marvel Entertainment was planning to produce its own films independently and distribute them through Paramount Pictures.[1] Previously, Marvel had co-produced several superhero films based on Marvel Comics with Columbia Pictures, New Line Cinema, 20th Century Fox, and others.[2] Marvel made relatively little profit from these licensing deals and wanted to get more money out of its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution.[3] Avi Arad, head of Marvel Entertainment's film division known as Marvel Films, was pleased with director Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film trilogy (2002–2007) at Sony Pictures and Columbia but was less enthused with some of the other films. Arad decided to form Marvel Studios, Hollywood's first major independent film studio since DreamWorks Pictures was founded in 1994. Kevin Feige, Arad's second-in-command,[4] realized that unlike Spider-Man, Blade, and the X-Men which were respectively licensed to Sony, New Line, and Fox, Marvel owned the rights to the Avengers team. Feige, a self-described \"fanboy\", envisioned combining these characters in a shared universe similar to the one created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby for Marvel Comics in the 1960s.[5]\n\n\"It's never been done before and that's kind of the spirit everybody's taking it in. The other filmmakers aren't used to getting actors from other movies that other filmmakers have cast, certain plot lines that are connected or certain locations that are connected, but I think... everyone was on board for it and thinks that it's fun. Primarily because we've always remained consistent saying that the movie that we are making comes first. All of the connective tissue, all of that stuff is fun and is going to be very important if you want it to be. If the fans want to look further and find connections, then they're there. There are a few big ones obviously, that hopefully the mainstream audience will [be] able to follow as well. But... the reason that all the filmmakers are on board is that their movies need to stand on their own. They need to have a fresh vision, a unique tone, and the fact that they can interconnect if you want to follow those breadcrumbs is a bonus.\"\n\nTo raise capital, the studio secured funding from a seven-year, $525 million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch.[3] Marvel planned to release individual films for their main characters and then merge them in a crossover film;[7] Arad, who resigned in 2006, doubted this strategy would work. He insisted that it was his reputation that helped secure the initial financing.[4][8] In 2007, Feige was named studio chief. To preserve its artistic integrity, Marvel Studios formed a creative committee of six people familiar with its comic book lore: Feige, Marvel Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito, Marvel Comics' president of publishing Dan Buckley, Marvel Entertainment's chief creative officer Joe Quesada, comic book writer Brian Michael Bendis, and Marvel Entertainment president Alan Fine, who oversaw the committee.[4] Feige initially referred to the shared narrative continuity of the films as the \"Marvel Cinema Universe\",[9] but later used the term \"Marvel Cinematic Universe\".[10] Since the franchise expanded to other media, some have used this phrase to only refer to the feature films.[11]\n\nThe MCU films are released in groups called \"Phases\", beginning with Phase One and Phase Two.[12][13] In December 2009, the Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion. Disney said future Marvel Studios films would be distributed by its own studio once the prior deal with Paramount expired.[14][15] The films of Phase Three were announced at a special press event in October 2014.[16] By September 2015, Marvel Studios was integrated into Walt Disney Studios. Feige was reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter,[17] and the creative committee began having only \"nominal\" input on the films. They continued to consult on Marvel Television productions, which remained under Perlmutter's control.[18][19] All key film decisions moving forward were to be made by Feige, D'Esposito, and executive vice president Victoria Alonso.[18] The studio went on to establish the Marvel Studios Parliament, a \"brain trust\" of long-time executives at the company who help to elevate each other's projects where possible.[20] In November 2017, Feige said Avengers: Endgame (2019) would provide a definitive conclusion to the films thus far and begin a new period for the franchise.[21] He later said Phase Three would conclude \"The Infinity Saga\".[22]\n\nDisney was reportedly developing a Marvel-based television series for their new streaming service Disney+ by November 2017.[23] In July 2018, Feige said discussions had begun with Disney regarding any potential involvement Marvel Studios could have with the streaming service, which he felt was important for the wider company.[24] In September 2018, Marvel Studios was reported to be developing several limited series centered on \"second-tier\" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to headline their own films. Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes and would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development.[25] Feige said these series would \"tell stories... that we wouldn't be able to tell in a theatrical experience—a longer-form narrative\".[26] He added that being asked by Disney to create these series \"energized everyone creatively\" within Marvel Studios, since they \"could play in a new medium and throw the rules out the window in terms of structure and format\".[27] Television specials from the studio are marketed as \"Marvel Studios Special Presentations\".[28][29] The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022), a Special Presentation, was the first project Marvel Studios began planning for Disney+.[30]\n\nIn July 2019, Feige announced the Phase Four slate at San Diego Comic-Con, consisting of films and, for the first time, television event series on Disney+.[31] The Phase Four slate includes What If...?, the first animated series from Marvel Studios, and by July 2021 the studio was creating an \"animation branch and mini studio\",[32] known as Marvel Studios Animation,[33] to focus on more animated content beyond What If...?.[32] Alonso said Marvel had around 31 projects in various stages of development by September 2021.[34] In April 2022, Feige said he and Marvel Studios were on a creative retreat to plan and discuss the MCU films for the following 10 years.[35] That July, Feige announced some of the films and series for Phase Five and Phase Six at San Diego Comic-Con, revealing that the second three Phases were collectively known as \"The Multiverse Saga\".[36] After the \"creative experience\" of ending Phase Three and \"The Infinity Saga\" with Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame, and the expansion in the number of projects being produced by the studio in a short amount of time, Marvel Studios decided to move away from having an Avengers crossover film at the end of each Phase and instead decided to have a crossover culmination at the end of \"The Multiverse Saga\" with Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027).[37] The studio was excited to explore Kang the Conqueror as an overarching villain of the Multiverse Saga after Thanos in the Infinity Saga, because Kang was a different villain in part because he has multiple variants from different timelines within the multiverse.[38] The studio did not initially plan to build the next saga around Kang, and made that decision after seeing actor Jonathan Majors's performance in the first season of the Disney+ series Loki (2021), as well as dailies from the filming of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023).[39] After Majors was found guilty of assault and harassment amidst legal issues in December 2023, he was fired by Disney and Marvel Studios. At that time, Marvel was internally referring to The Kang Dynasty as Avengers 5.[40]\n\nAlonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios in March 2023 for serving as a producer on the Amazon Studios film Argentina, 1985 (2022), in breach of a 2018 agreement between Alonso and Disney to not work for a competing studio. The decision was made by a group that included Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman and Disney's human resources and legal departments.[41][42] Alonso reportedly did not seek permission to work on the film and was asked by Disney to stop working on it or promoting it. The situation was deemed serious enough that Disney requested a new agreement be signed. The company consistently reminded her of this while she continued to promote the film following its September 2022 premiere, ultimately leading to her firing.[41] Alonso's lawyers refuted these claims, saying Disney was aware of, and agreed to, Alonso's work on Argentina, 1985 and Alonso had been \"silenced [and] was terminated when she refused to do something she believed was reprehensible\";[43] this was reported to be a disagreement with a Disney executive over the censoring of gay pride elements in Quantumania so the film could be released in Kuwait in compliance with the country's restrictive anti-LGBTQ laws.[44][45] A Disney spokesperson reiterated that Alonso was fired due to \"an indisputable breach of contract and a direct violation of company policy\" among other factors.[43] Disney and Alonso reached a multi-million dollar compensation settlement in April.[46]\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger said in July 2023 that the company would be reducing the amount of Marvel content created moving forward, admitting that Marvel Studios' expansion into Disney+ series and more films had \"diluted focus and attention\" after several underachieving films at the box office.[47][48] He clarified their plans in May 2024, saying Disney would now release two, or at most three, Marvel films and two Marvel series a year. This was a decrease from up to four films and around four series being released in some recent years. The company was reducing output and focusing on quality across all its divisions, but Iger felt the change was especially needed for Marvel.[49] Feige and D'Esposito said 2023 had been a particularly difficult year and a \"rough time\" for the studio but they had learned their lesson on trying to make too much content at once. They added that no longer being \"on top\" of the box office allowed them to be underdogs again, as they had been when starting work on Phase One, and they would be \"coming back strong\" with the hope of surprising audiences and exceeding expectations.[50] Feige expected the studio to begin releasing two films and three series per year after 2025, when they were planning to release three films and six series that had been in development for a long time and were ready to be released.[51]\n\nIn 2024, Marvel Studios introduced their \"Marvel Animation\" and \"Marvel Television\" banners for their animated and live-action series, respectively. This was done, along with the previously established Marvel Spotlight banner, to help indicate to audiences that they did not have to watch all of the studio's projects to understand the overall story and could choose which storylines and characters under these banners to follow.[52] At San Diego Comic-Con 2024, the fifth Avengers film was retitled Avengers: Doomsday (2026), with Robert Downey Jr. cast as the Multiverse Saga's new antagonist Victor von Doom / Doctor Doom (after previously portraying the superhero Tony Stark / Iron Man in the MCU from 2008 to 2019) for both Doomsday and Secret Wars.[53]\n\nIn December 2017, Disney agreed to acquire assets from 21st Century Fox.[54] The transaction officially closed on March 19, 2019.[55] This saw the return of the film rights for Deadpool, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four to Marvel Studios,[54] although Feige explained that despite the acquisition finalizing in 2019, access and integration of these characters and concepts were unavailable \"for a very long time\" because of corporate acquisition laws.[56] Some of the first elements to be integrated into the MCU following the acquisition were the organization S.W.O.R.D. in the Disney+ series WandaVision (2021) and the fictional country Madripoor in the series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021).[57][58] Additionally, Patrick Stewart appeared as Professor Charles Xavier in the film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022), portraying a different version of the character that he previously played in Fox's X-Men film series,[59] while Kamala Khan was revealed to have a genetic mutation in Ms. Marvel,[60] with star Iman Vellani confirming that she is the first mutant (a term related to the X-Men) in the MCU.[61] Namor is also revealed to be a mutant in the film Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022), as he is in the comics.[62][38] Kelsey Grammer appears as Dr. Hank McCoy / Beast in The Marvels (2023), reprising the role from the X-Men films series, which also introduces the mutant Binary, an alternate version of Maria Rambeau, portrayed by Lashana Lynch.[63][64]\n\nFeige called Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) the true start to Marvel Studios' exploration and use of the Fox characters,[56] and said every project after it would be part of the MCU's \"Mutant era\".[65] Some of the films between Deadpool & Wolverine and Secret Wars featured additional X-Men characters, with Feige saying the story of Secret Wars would lead into a \"new age of mutants\" and the X-Men being introduced to the MCU.[66]\n\nMarvel Television was launched in June 2010 with Jeph Loeb as head,[67] and had entered into discussions with ABC to create a show set in the MCU by July 2012;[68] the network went on to release Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter,[69] and Inhumans. The latter was a co-production with IMAX Corporation.[70][71][72] In November 2013, Disney was set to provide Netflix with the live-action series Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist, building up to the crossover miniseries The Defenders.[73] In April 2016, Netflix ordered The Punisher, a spin-off of Daredevil.[74] By February 2019, Netflix had canceled all of its Marvel series.[75] In April 2016, the Disney-owned cable network Freeform announced Cloak & Dagger.[76] In May 2017, Marvel announced that Runaways had received a series order from Hulu.[77] In May 2019, Marvel announced that Helstrom had been greenlit for Hulu.[78]\n\nIn October 2019, further corporate restructuring saw Feige named Chief Creative Officer of Marvel Entertainment, with Marvel Television becoming part of Marvel Studios and executives of Marvel Television reporting to Feige.[79] In December 2019, Marvel Television was folded into Marvel Studios, with Marvel Studios taking over production of the remaining series and no further series expected to be developed by Marvel Television.[80] In January 2021, Feige said \"never say never\" to potentially reviving the Netflix series, but noted that Marvel Studios was focused on their new Disney+ series.[81] In May 2022, Marvel Studios was revealed to be developing a new Daredevil series for Disney+,[82] which was announced in July as Daredevil: Born Again.[36]\n\nIn 2008, the first comic book to tie-into the MCU was released.[83] Quesada explained that these comics would be set within the continuity of the films, but were not intended to be direct adaptions. Rather, they would explore \"something that happened off screen\" or flesh out something briefly mentioned. Feige was involved with the creation of the comics, with the film's screenwriters sometimes as well.[84] Marvel Comics worked with Brad Winderbaum, Jeremy Latcham, and Will Corona Pilgrim at Marvel Studios to decide which concepts would be carried over from the Marvel Comics Universe to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, what to show in the tie-in comics, and what to leave for the films.[85] Marvel later clarified which of the tie-in comics are considered canonical MCU stories, with the rest being merely inspired by the MCU \"where we get to show off all the characters from the film in costume and in comic form\".[86]\n\nIn August 2011, Marvel announced a series of direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots.[87] The name was derived from the label used by Marvel Comics for their one-shot comics.[88] Winderbaum said the shorts were \"a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas\" and to expand the MCU.[87] Each short was designed to be a self-contained story that provided more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films.[89]\n\nIn March 2015, Marvel's Vice President of Animation Development and Production, Cort Lane, said animated tie-ins to the MCU were \"in the works\".[90] That July, Marvel Studios partnered with Google to produce the faux news program WHIH Newsfront with Christine Everhart, a series of in-universe YouTube videos serving as the center of a viral marketing campaign to promote the films and universe.[91] In December 2016, a six-part web series, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot, debuted on ABC.com. It follows Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez on a secret mission, shortly before the start of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s fourth season, with Natalia Cordova-Buckley reprising her role from the series.[92] In September 2019, Sony created a real version of the fictional The Daily Bugle website as part of a viral marketing campaign to promote the home media release of Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Inspired by real-world \"conspiracy-pushing\" websites such as Alex Jones's InfoWars, the website features J. K. Simmons reprising his role as J. Jonah Jameson in a video where he speaks out against Spider-Man before asking viewers to \"like and subscribe\".[93][94] In December 2020, Marvel Studios announced I Am Groot, a series of photorealistic animated shorts starring Baby Groot for Disney+.[95][96][97]\n\nIn November 2016, Feige explained that the studio would often put together a \"lookbook\" of influences from the comics and art by Marvel's visual development department, to create a visual template for a project. These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds approximately every 18 months to plan out future projects and develop the phases of the MCU. However, these lookbooks are not always shown to directors, with Marvel sometimes preferring to let the director offer their own ideas first.[98] When choosing a director for a project, Marvel Studios looks for filmmakers to hire who can guide a film.[99] Some of their choices for directors have been considered \"out-of-left-field based on those director's previous work. On this, Feige remarked that \"you don't have to have directed a big, giant visual-effects movie to do a big, giant visual-effects movie for us. You just have to have done something singularly sort of awesome.\"[100]\n\nThe studio ensures directors are open to the idea of the shared universe and are willing to include connective material, such as Kenneth Branagh and Joe Johnston needing to include scenes that set-up The Avengers (2012) in their respective Phase One films Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger (both 2011).[5] Marvel Studios usually has a big idea they would like to explore or build to in a project, such as Hydra infiltrating S.H.I.E.L.D. in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), but they leave it up to the filmmakers to interpret and \"improv a little bit\" to get that point.[101] After these ideas have been developed, the creative team then begins exploring ideas from other future projects to see how to make any larger universe connections.[102]\n\nIn August 2012, Marvel signed The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) director Joss Whedon to an exclusive contract through June 2015 for film and television. With the deal, Whedon contributed creatively to all of the Phase Two films and also developed Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., the first television series set in the MCU.[103] In April 2017, Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) writer and director James Gunn revealed that he would be working with Marvel to help plan future stories for the Guardians of the Galaxy characters and the wider \"Marvel Cosmic Universe\",[104] although Gunn became the co-CEO of DC Studios in November 2022 and signed a four-year deal to work exclusively on DC Comics-based projects.[105] For Phase Three, there was a large amount of collaboration between the filmmakers of the individual character films and the filmmakers of the crossover films Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, which were directed by the Russo brothers and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. This was to ensure their storytelling aligned for the Infinity Saga's culmination.[106]\n\nMarvel Studios began contracting their actors for multiple films, including signing actor Samuel L. Jackson to a then-unprecedented nine-film contract.[107] Feige said the studio had all actors sign contracts for multiple films, with the normal number being for three or more while the nine or twelve film deals were rare.[108] The actors' contracts also feature clauses that allow Marvel to use up to three minutes of an actor's performance from one film in another, which Marvel describes as \"bridging material\".[19] By the start of Phase Four, Marvel Studios was no longer contracting actors for a large number of projects, with deal lengths varying for each actor and project. Feige said the studio was looking for actors who were excited to join the franchise and appear in multiple projects without being locked into contractual obligations. He also noted that they were starting to include theme park attractions in actors' deals.[109] By December 2020, because of the impact COVID-19 had on theaters and film studios shifting away from theatrical releases, Marvel Studios began exploring updated contracts for actors, writers, directors, and producers to receive adjusted compensation in the event a film had to debut on Disney+ instead of in theaters. TheWrap reported that the new contracts would likely only apply to films about to enter production. It was unclear if any adjustments would be made to contracts for films already completed but not yet released.[110]\n\nFor Marvel Television, Loeb said he and his executives were involved in all aspects of production: \"whether it's being in the writers' room, editing, on set, casting—every step of the production goes through the Marvel team to tell the best story that we can\". He said the studio was able to work on so many series across different networks and platforms because all they needed was one person working on each series to help \"guide the process\".[111] Actors appearing in Marvel Television series, such as Charlie Cox (who portrayed Matt Murdock / Daredevil in Daredevil) and Adrianne Palicki (Bobbi Morse / Mockingbird in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), were contractually obliged to appear in a Marvel film if asked.[112][113] When developing the crossover miniseries The Defenders, showrunner Marco Ramirez consulted with the creators of all the individual Marvel Netflix series, having them read each of the scripts for The Defenders and provide insight into individual characters' worlds.[114] In December 2021, Feige confirmed that Cox would reprise the role of Daredevil in Marvel Studios MCU productions,[115] with Cox first reprising the role in the film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). Additionally, Vincent D'Onofrio first reprised his role as Wilson Fisk / Kingpin from Daredevil in the Disney+ series Hawkeye (2021).[116]\n\nMarvel Studios releases its films in groups called \"Phases\".[12][13]\n\nThe first three phases are collectively known as \"The Infinity Saga\".[22] Phase One consists of Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and concludes with the crossover film The Avengers (2012). Phase Two comprises Iron Man 3 (2013), Thor: The Dark World (2013), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and Ant-Man (2015). Captain America: Civil War (2016) is the first film of Phase Three, and is followed by Doctor Strange (2016), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Black Panther (2018), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), Captain Marvel (2019), Avengers: Endgame (2019), and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019).[13]\n\nThe second three phases are collectively known as \"The Multiverse Saga\", and include television series on Disney+.[36] Phase Four includes Black Widow (2021), Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021), Eternals (2021), Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022), Thor: Love and Thunder (2022), and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022). Phase Five begins with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), followed by Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023), The Marvels (2023), Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), and Captain America: Brave New World (2025), and will conclude with Thunderbolts* (2025).[13] Phase Six begins with The Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025),[117] followed by Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and the untitled fourth Spider-Man film (2026), and will conclude with Avengers: Secret Wars (2027).[53][118] The planned film Blade is also intended to be part of the phase but does not have a release date.[119][117]\n\nMarvel Television produced multiple television series set in the MCU across broadcast, streaming, and cable. Its ABC series included Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013–2020), Agent Carter (2015–2016), and Inhumans (2017); its Netflix series included Daredevil (2015–2018), Jessica Jones (2015–2019), Luke Cage (2016–2018), Iron Fist (2017–2018), the crossover miniseries The Defenders (2017), and The Punisher (2017–2019); its young adult series included Runaways (2017–2019) streaming on Hulu and Cloak & Dagger (2018–2019) airing on Freeform; and the Hulu series Helstrom (2020) was originally intended to be the start of a planned \"Adventure into Fear\" franchise,[120] but was ultimately \"not tied to the MCU\", according to showrunner Paul Zbyszewski.[121]\n\nBeginning with Phase Four, television series were included as part of the Phases in addition to their feature films. Each series is released on Disney+. Phase Four includes the series WandaVision (2021), The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021), the first season of Loki (2021), the first season of the animated series What If...? (2021), Hawkeye (2021), Moon Knight (2022), Ms. Marvel (2022), and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022). The television specials Werewolf by Night (2022) and The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022) are also included in the phase. Phase Five includes Secret Invasion (2023), the second season of Loki (2023), the second season of What If...? (2023), Echo (2024), Agatha All Along (2024), the third season of What If...? (2024), the first season of Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man (2025), the first season of Daredevil: Born Again (2025), and Ironheart (2025).[13][122] Phase Six will include Eyes of Wakanda (2025), Marvel Zombies (2025), Wonder Man (2025), and Vision Quest (2026).[123]\n\nMarvel One-Shots are a series of direct-to-video short films that are included as special features in the MCU films' Blu-ray and digital distribution releases. The films included The Consultant (2011), A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer (2011),[87] Item 47 (2012),[124] Agent Carter (2013),[125] and All Hail the King (2014).[126]\n\nFollowing the One-Shots becoming available on Disney+ in January 2022, Marvel classified the Team Thor mockumentary shorts as One-Shots.[127][128][129] Team Thor is a series of direct-to-video mockumentary short films that were released from 2016 to 2018, consisting of Team Thor, Team Thor: Part 2, and Team Darryl, all written and directed by Taika Waititi.[130][131][132]\n\nI Am Groot is a series of photorealistic animated short films for Disney+ starring Baby Groot going on adventures with new and unusual characters.[95][96][97] Vin Diesel reprises his role, with five shorts releasing on August 10, 2022.[133] A second season with five additional shorts was released on September 6, 2023.[134]\n\nWHIH Newsfront (2015–16) is an in-universe current affairs show that serves as a viral marketing campaign for some of the MCU films, created in partnership with Google for YouTube.[91][135] The campaign is an extension of the fictional news network WHIH World News, which is seen reporting on major events in many MCU films and television series.[136] Leslie Bibb reprises her role as Christine Everhart from the Iron Man films.[135]\n\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot (2016) is one of several Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. web series created for ABC.com and produced by Marvel Television that is a supplement to Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., with the main cast reprising their roles.[92]\n\nThe first two seasons of The Daily Bugle (2019–2022) are an in-universe current affairs show serving as a viral marketing campaign for the films Spider-Man: Far From Home and Spider-Man: No Way Home, with the videos released on YouTube and TikTok. It is based on the fictional sensationalist news outlet of the same name that appears in the MCU—itself based on the fictional newspaper agency of the same name appearing in several Marvel Comics publications. J. K. Simmons and Angourie Rice reprise their roles as J. Jonah Jameson and Betty Brant from the Spider-Man films.[137]\n\nMultiple limited series or one-shot comic books that tie into the MCU films and television series have been published by Marvel Comics. They are intended to tell additional stories about existing characters or to make connections between MCU projects, without necessarily expanding the universe or introducing new concepts or characters.[85][138]\n\nThe Wakanda Files: A Technological Exploration of the Avengers and Beyond is \"a collection of papers, articles, blueprints, and notes amassed throughout history by Wakanda's War Dogs\" at the request of Shuri. It is organized by areas of study and covers the technological advancements throughout the MCU. The book, which exists within the universe, was written by Troy Benjamin and published by Epic Ink and Quarto Publishing Group. The Wakanda Files has content printed with UV ink that can be viewed with Kimoyo bead–shaped UV lights included with the book. It was released on October 20, 2020.[139]\n\nLook Out for the Little Guy, the fictional memoir written by Scott Lang as seen in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, was released by Hyperion Avenue on September 5, 2023. It was created alongside Marvel Studios and the Quantumania filmmakers,[140] and was written by Rob Kutner,[141] featuring \"over 20 short pieces exploring different aspects of Scott's experiences\" as a father and Avenger.[140] Quantumania writer Jeff Loveness wrote the material from the memoir that was featured in the film.[141]\n\nVarious composers have created the film and television scores of the MCU films, television series, One-Shots, Special Presentations, and other related projects of the MCU, primarily released by Marvel Studios's record label Marvel Music. Original songs have also been created specifically for use in the franchise, while Brian Tyler and Michael Giacchino have both scored fanfares for the Marvel Studios production logo.[142][143]\n\nThe fictional timeline of the MCU includes the feature films, television series, television specials, short films, and the I Am Groot shorts from Marvel Studios and Marvel Television's Netflix series. While the early films of Phase One and Phase Two of the franchise followed each other in the timeline similar to their release order, Phase Three saw many of the films overlapping with each other in the timeline, while also introducing the first prequel property, Captain Marvel. The Phase Three film Avengers: Endgame featured characters traveling into the past and introduced a five-year time jump, with many subsequent releases in Phase Four and Phase Five set after Endgame's events in the timeline. The television series Loki and What If...? were the first properties to occur outside of the main timeline and explore alternative timelines and universes.\n\nThere have been numerous attempts by Marvel Studios and others to codify the events of the MCU, which have been subject to perceived continuity errors, resulting in Marvel Studios releasing an official timeline book in 2023 for their first four phases that were designated as part of their \"Sacred Timeline\". This book did not feature projects produced by other companies, such as Marvel Television's series which all had been loosely connected to the films, however, it was noted all of these outside projects were part of the larger Marvel canon. In early 2024, Marvel Studios formally integrated Marvel Television's group of Netflix series into their Disney+ timeline.\n\nAs of the Phase Five television series Secret Invasion and the film The Marvels, the \"present day\" in the MCU is 2026.[144][145][146] The following covers and discusses MCU media released by Marvel Studios and the Netflix series by Marvel Television. Loki and What If...? are excluded from the diagram because they occur outside of the main timeline. Werewolf by Night is also excluded given the special explicitly does not indicate where it takes place in the MCU. Disney+'s timeline order places the first seasons of Loki and What If...? between Avengers: Endgame and WandaVision, their second seasons after The Marvels, and Werewolf by Night after Thor: Love and Thunder; Werewolf by Night is also placed here in The Marvel Cinematic Universe: An Official Timeline.\n\nThe Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z, Vol. 5, published in 2008, originally designated the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Earth-199999 within the continuity of Marvel's comic multiverse, a collection of fictional alternate universes, although, this designation was rarely used officially outside of the source material.[196] The television series Loki and What If...? were the first to explore the concept of the multiverse within the MCU,[197][198] as well as the film Spider-Man: No Way Home, which connected the MCU to other Spider-Man film franchises by featuring characters from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films, and Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU).[199][200] The SSU film Venom: Let There Be Carnage briefly featured the main universe of the MCU as well.[200] In Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, the main universe of MCU events was designated as Earth-616 (a designation first referenced in Spider-Man: Far From Home), sharing the name of the main Marvel Comics universe, while another universe was designated as Earth-838.[201] Sony's animated film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse references the events of No Way Home, citing the MCU's primary reality as Earth-199999.[202] 20th Century Fox's X-Men film series is designated as Earth-10005 in Deadpool & Wolverine.[203] That film features several actors reprising their roles from the X-Men film series along with characters from Fox's films Daredevil and its spin-off Elektra, Fantastic Four (2005) and its sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007), and New Line Cinema's Blade film trilogy.[204][205] Phases Four, Five, and Six comprise \"The Multiverse Saga\".[36]\n\nWith the release of The Marvel Cinematic Universe: An Official Timeline in October 2023, Feige wrote in its foreword that Marvel Studios only considered, at that time, projects developed by them in their first four phases as part of their \"Sacred Timeline\", but acknowledged the history of other Marvel films and television series that would exist in the larger multiverse and said they were \"canonical to Marvel\".[206] In January 2024, Winderbaum acknowledged that Marvel Studios had previously been \"a little bit cagey\" about what was part of their Sacred Timeline, noting how there had been the corporate divide between what Marvel Studios created and what Marvel Television created. He continued that as time had passed, Marvel Studios began to see \"how well integrated the [Marvel Television] stories are\" and personally felt confident in saying Marvel Television's Daredevil was part of the Sacred Timeline.[207]\n\nThis section includes characters who will appear or have appeared in at least three MCU films/series and received main billing credit in at least two franchises.\n\nAdditionally, Paul Bettany was the first actor to portray two main characters within the universe, voicing Tony Stark's artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. and portraying Vision.[316][317][318][319] J. K. Simmons became the first actor to reprise a non-MCU role in the MCU when he appeared as J. Jonah Jameson (a role he played in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy from 2002 to 2007) in Spider-Man: Far From Home.[320]\n\nPrior to his death in 2018, Stan Lee, the creator or co-creator of many of the characters adapted in the MCU, made cameo appearances in all of the feature films and television series except Inhumans. In Iron Fist, it is revealed his on-set photograph cameo in the Marvel Netflix series is as NYPD Captain Irving Forbush.[321] His cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees Lee appearing as an informant to the Watchers, discussing previous adventures that include Lee's cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a FedEx delivery man, referring to Lee's cameo in Captain America: Civil War.[322] This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos,[323] with writer and director James Gunn noting that commentators believed Lee was portraying the character Uatu the Watcher and \"that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher. So, Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU.\"[322][323] Feige added that Lee \"clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films. So the notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in Guardians...really says, so wait a minute, he's this same character who's popped up in all these films?\"[324] Following Lee's death, Marvel Studios chose not to create any new Lee cameos in future projects.[325] NY1 news anchor Pat Kiernan has also appeared in multiple MCU films and television series as himself.[326]\n\nEarly on, the shared universe element of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was criticized by some journalists. Around the release of The Avengers in 2012, Jim Vorel of Herald & Review called the Marvel Cinematic Universe \"complicated\" and \"impressive\", but said, \"As more and more heroes get their own film adaptations, the overall universe becomes increasingly confusing.\"[327] Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant stated that while The Avengers was a success, \"Marvel Studios still has room to improve their approach to building a shared movie universe\".[328] Some reviewers criticized the fact that the desire to create a shared universe led to films that did not hold as well on their own. In his review of Thor: The Dark World, Forbes critic Scott Mendelson likened the MCU to \"a glorified television series\", with The Dark World being a \"'stand-alone' episode that contains little long-range mythology\".[329] Collider's Matt Goldberg considered that while Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger were quality productions, \"they have never really been their own movies\", feeling that the plot detours to S.H.I.E.L.D. or lead-ups to The Avengers dragged down the films' narratives.[330]\n\nThe metaphor of the MCU as \"the world's biggest TV show\" was discussed again, after the release of Captain America: Civil War, by Emily VanDerWerff of Vox, who felt that film in particular highlighted Marvel's success with the model, saying, \"Viewed in complete isolation, the plot of Captain America: Civil War makes little to no sense ... [but] when you think about where [Captain America] has been in earlier Marvel films ... his leeriness about being subject to oversight makes a lot more sense.\" VanDerWerff continued that when thinking about the MCU as a television series, many \"common criticisms people tend to level at it take on a new context\" such as complaints that the films are formulaic, lack \"visual spark\", or \"shoehorn in story elements\" that \"are necessary to set up future films\", all characteristics that \"are fairly typical on television, where a director's influence is much lower than that of the showrunner\", in this case, Feige. Comparing the films to the series Game of Thrones specifically, VanDerWerff noted that each solo film checks \"in on various characters and their individual side stories, before bringing everyone together in the finale (or, rather, an Avengers film)\", with Guardians of the Galaxy being equivalent to the character Daenerys Targaryen—\"both separated by long distances from everybody else\". She noted that this format was an extension of early \"TV-like\" film franchises such as Star Wars, as well as the format of the comics upon which the films are based. \"I say all of this not to suggest that film franchises resembling TV series is necessarily a good trend\", VanDerWerff concluded, \"For as much as I generally enjoy the Marvel movies, I'm disheartened by the possibility that their particular form might take over the film industry ... But I also don't think it's the end of the world if Marvel continues on ... there's a reason TV has stolen so much of the cultural conversation over the past few decades. There's something legitimately exciting about the way the medium tells stories when it's good, and if nothing else, Marvel's success shows the film world could learn from that.\"[331]\n\nFollowing the conclusion of season one of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Mary McNamara at the Los Angeles Times praised the connections between that series and the films, stating that \"never before has television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise ... [Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.] is now not only a very good show in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination.\"[332] Terri Schwartz of Zap2it agreed with this sentiment, stating that \"the fact that [Captain America: The Winter Soldier] so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven\", though \"the fault there seems to be that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. had to bide time until The Winter Soldier's release\", which led to much criticism.[333]\n\nIn January 2015, Michael Doran of Newsarama and Graeme McMillian of The Hollywood Reporter had a \"point-counterpoint\" debate in response to the first Ant-Man trailer. Doran stated, \"Marvel has raised the bar sooo high that as opposed to just allowing another film to finish under the [MCU] bar, we're all overly and perhaps even eager to overreact to the first thing that doesn't clear it\". McMillian responded, \"at this point, Marvel's brand is such that I'm not sure it can offer up something like [the trailer] without it seeming like a crushing disappointment ... part of Marvel's brand is that it doesn't offer the kind of run-of-the-mill superhero movie that you're talking about, that it's ... at least different enough to tweak and play with the genre somehow ... The fact that there's such upset about this trailer being ... well, okay ... suggests to me that the audience is expecting something to knock their socks off.\" Doran concluded, \"That does seem to be the point here—the expectations fans now have for everything Marvel Studios ... [and] Marvel is going to eventually falter.\"[334]\n\nAfter seeing the portrayal of Yellowjacket in Ant-Man, the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted, \n\nIt's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios has a bit of a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... [their] villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy in a Suit with an Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: evil. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange thing about this is that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ... In future movies, we can only hope [they are] treated in such a way that their freak flags are allowed to fly free.[335]\nFollowing the release of Jessica Jones, David Priest at CNET wrote about how the series rescues \"Marvel from itself ... Jessica Jones takes big steps forward in terms of theme, craft and diversity. It's a good story first, and a superhero show second. And for the first time, the MCU seems like it matters. Our culture needs stories like this. Here's hoping Marvel keeps them coming.\"[336] For Paul Tassi and Erik Kain of Forbes, watching the series made them question the MCU, with Kain feeling that the \"morally complex, violent, dark world of Jessica Jones has no place in the MCU ... right now, the MCU is holding back shows like Jessica Jones and Daredevil, while those shows are contributing absolutely nothing to the MCU.\"[337] Tassi went so far as to wonder what \"the point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\" is, lamenting the lack of major crossovers in the franchise since the Winter Soldier reveal on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and saying that Jessica Jones is \"so far removed from the world of The Avengers, it might as well not be in the same universe at all ... [I] really don't understand the point of [the MCU] if they're going to keep everything within it separated off in these little boxes\".[338] Conversely, Eric Francisco of Inverse called Jessica Jones's lack of overt connections to the MCU \"the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, Jessica Jones also proves the MCU's thematic durability.\"[339]\n\nIn April 2016, Marvel Studios revealed that Alfre Woodard would appear in Captain America: Civil War, having already been cast as Mariah Dillard in Luke Cage the previous year.[340] This \"raised hopes that Marvel could be uniting its film and Netflix universes\",[341] with \"one of the first and strongest connections\" between the two.[340] Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely revealed that Woodard would instead be portraying Miriam Sharpe in the film, explaining that she had been cast on the suggestion of Robert Downey Jr., and they had not learned of her casting in Luke Cage until afterwards.[340] This was not the first instance of actors being cast in multiple roles in the MCU, but this casting was called more \"significant\", and seen by many as a \"disappointing\" indication of \"the growing divide\" and \"lack of more satisfying cooperation\" between Marvel Studios and Marvel Television following the September 2015 corporate reshuffling of Marvel Entertainment.[340][342]\n\n\nSpeaking to the 1990s setting of Captain Marvel, \"the MCU's first full period piece since Phase One's Captain America: The First Avenger in 2011\", Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter felt the return of younger versions of some characters introduced and killed in earlier films \"open[ed] up the MCU in a whole new way and broaden[ed] the franchise's mantra of 'it's all connected'\". Speaking specifically to Clark Gregg's appearance as Agent Phil Coulson in the film, Newby noted the appearance \"doesn't exactly mend fences between Marvel's film and TV divisions, [but] it does strengthen the connective tissue and the sense that these characters still matter in the grand scheme of Marvel's film plans\". He also hoped that continuity from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. would be maintained in Captain Marvel, especially since Coulson has dealt with the Kree in the series. Newby also added that shifting to different time periods would help Marvel Studios \"sustain this cinematic universe for the next 10 years\" by allowing them to repeat some of the genres previously used, as they could then feel \"fresh\" and have \"different rules and different restraints\", as well as allow them to build upon material established in the television series such as Agent Carter. He concluded, \nMarvel Studios has an entire sandbox to play in, but, for necessary reasons, has largely chosen to remain in a small corner in order to ground audiences in these concepts. Now that the basis has been laid, the opportunity for exploration in both film and television lies ahead, with Captain Marvel leading the way. Wherever Marvel Studios plans to take the MCU in the future, it's refreshing to know that its past is expansive and filled with infinite possibilities.[343]\nLikewise, in his review of Avengers: Endgame, Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal acknowledged the unique achievement that the Marvel Cinematic Universe had accomplished:\n\nThese are difficult times for big-screen entertainment. As the medium declines and TV grows ascendant, authentic spectacles—as opposed to lavish embellishments of smallish ideas—threaten to become a thing of the fabled past. All the more reason, then, to cherish what Marvel has achieved, even though befuddling stumbles have occurred along the way. The studio has kept the faith by smartening up most of its films, not dumbing them down, by banking on, and raking in profits from, the audience's appetite for surprise, its capacity for complexity. When the final battle comes at the end of Avengers: Endgame, it's inevitably unwieldy—every Marvel character you can think of from the past decade shows up for one more assault on cosmic evil—but thrilling all the same, and followed by a delicate coda. So many stories. So many adventures. So much to sort out before the next cycle starts.[344]\nMany famous filmmakers expressed different views both on the success and quality of MCU. In October 2019, filmmaker Martin Scorsese openly criticized Marvel films in an interview and during a David Lean lecture in London, later expanded in an op-ed in The New York Times, asserting that these films are not cinema, but are instead the equivalent of theme park rides that lack \"mystery, revelation or genuine emotional danger\".[345][346][347] He also stated that such films are corporation products that have been \"market-researched, audience-tested, vetted, modified, revetted and remodified until they're ready for consumption\", and that the invasion of such \"theme park\" films in theaters crowded out films by other directors.[348] Scorsese's remarks were dismissed by directors of MCU films such as Joss Whedon and James Gunn,[345] while they were defended by Francis Ford Coppola, who described the potential effect of Marvel films in the film industry as \"despicable\".[349] In September 2021, director Denis Villeneuve noted that Marvel films \"are nothing more than a 'cut and paste' of others\" that have \"turned us into zombies a bit\".[350] In February 2022, director Roland Emmerich felt large blockbuster films such as the MCU and Star Wars films were \"ruining our industry a little\", since \"nobody does anything original anymore\".[351] Conversely, George Miller stated, \"To me, it's all cinema. I don't think you can ghettoize it and say, oh this is cinema or that is cinema. It applies to all the arts, to literature, the performing arts, painting and music, in all its form. It's such a broad spectrum, a wide range and to say that anyone is more significant or more important than the other, is missing the point. It's one big mosaic and each bit of work fits into it.\"[352]\n\nMarvel's American audience was studied by Morning Consult in 2021, which found that 9% of Marvel's fan base is Generation Z, 64% of fans are White adults, and 42% of fans live in suburban areas.[353] In 2023, critics began describing the volume of interconnected storylines as a \"homework assignment\".[354]\n\nAfter the release of The Avengers in May 2012, Tom Russo of Boston.com noted that aside from the occasional \"novelty\" such as Alien vs. Predator (2004), the idea of a shared universe was virtually unheard of in Hollywood.[5] Since that time, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters. In April 2014, Tuna Amobi, a media analyst for Standard & Poor's Equity Research Services, stated that in the previous three to five years, Hollywood studios began planning \"megafranchises\" for years to come, as opposed to working one blockbuster at a time. Amobi added, \"A lot of these superhero characters were just being left there to gather dust. Disney has proved that this [approach and genre] can be a gold mine.\"[355] With more studios now \"playing the megafranchise game\", Doug Creutz, media analyst for Cowen and Company, feels the allure will eventually die for audiences: \"If Marvel's going to make two or three films a year, and Warner Brothers is going to do at least a film every year, and Sony's going to do a film every year, and Fox [is] going to do a film every year, can everyone do well in that scenario? I'm not sure they can.\"[355]\n\nIn March 2018, Patrick Shanley of The Hollywood Reporter opined that \"the key differences between a regular franchise, such as The Fast and the Furious or Pitch Perfect films, and a shared universe is the amount of planning and interweaving that goes into each individual film. Its all too easy to make a film that exists solely for the purpose of setting up future installments and expanding a world, rather than a film that stands on its own merits while deftly hinting or winking at its place in the larger mythos. In that, the MCU has flourished.\" He felt that Iron Man \"itself was aimed at being an enjoyable stand-alone experience, not as an overall advertisement for 17 subsequent movies. That mentality has persisted through most of the MCU films over the past decade, which is all the more impressive as its roster of heroes now exceeds the two-dozen mark.\"[356]\n\nIn October 2012, following its legal victory over Joe Shuster's estate for the rights to Superman, Warner Bros. Pictures announced that it planned to move ahead with its long-awaited Justice League film, uniting such DC Comics superheroes as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The company was expected to take the opposite approach to Marvel, releasing individual films for the characters after they have appeared in a team-up film.[357] The release of Man of Steel in 2013 was intended to be the start of a new shared universe for DC, \"laying the groundwork for the future slate of films based on DC Comics\".[358] In 2014, Warner Bros. announced that slate of films, similarly to Disney and Marvel claiming dates for films years in advance.[359] That year, DC chief creative officer Geoff Johns stated that the television series Arrow and The Flash were set in a separate universe from the new film one,[360] later clarifying that \"We look at it as the multiverse. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach [from Marvel's].\"[361]\n\nDiscussing the apparent failure of the cinematic universe's first team-up film, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), to establish a successful equivalent to the MCU, Emily VanDerWerff noted that where the MCU has a television-like \"showrunner\" in Feige, \"the visionary behind Marvel's entire slate\", the DCEU has director Zack Snyder, whose DC films \"seemingly start from the assumption that people have come not to see an individual story but a long series of teases for other ones. It's like he knows what he needs to do but can't focus on the task at hand. TV certainly isn't immune to that problem, but shows that get caught up in high-concept premises and big-picture thinking before doing the necessary legwork to establish characters and their relationships tend to be canceled.\"[331] Subsequently, in May 2016, Warner Bros. gave oversight of the DCEU to Johns and executive Jon Berg in an attempt to \"unify the disparate elements of the DC movies\" and emulate Marvel's success. The two were made producers on the Justice League films, on top of Johns' involvement in several \"solo\" films, such as the post-production process of Suicide Squad (2016) or the writing process of a standalone Batman film.[362] After the successful release of Wonder Woman in June 2017, DC decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson stating, \"Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn't make sense, but there's no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them.\" Additionally, DC began focusing on films \"completely separate from everything else, set entirely outside\" the DCEU as part of a new label, with the first film centered on the Joker.[363] In August 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav announced a 10-year plan for the DC Extended Universe similar to the one that Horn and Iger employed with Feige for the MCU,[364] with James Gunn and Peter Safran appointed in October 2022 to serve as the co-chairmen and co-CEOs of the newly formed DC Studios to develop a new DC shared universe,[105] the first content for which was announced in January 2023.[365]\n\nIn November 2012, 20th Century Fox announced plans to create their own shared universe, consisting of Marvel properties that it held the rights to including the Fantastic Four and X-Men, with the hiring of Mark Millar as supervising producer. Millar said, \"Fox are thinking, 'We're sitting on some really awesome things here. There is another side of the Marvel Universe. Let's try and get some cohesiveness going.' So they brought me in to oversee that really. To meet with the writers and directors to suggest new ways we could take this stuff and new properties that could spin out of it.\"[366] X-Men: Days of Future Past, released in 2014, was Fox's first step towards expanding their stable of Marvel properties and creating this universe,[367] ahead of the release of a Fantastic Four reboot film the next year.[368] In May 2014, Days of Future Past and Fantastic Four screenwriter Simon Kinberg stated that the latter film would not take place in the same universe as the X-Men films, explaining that \"none of the X-Men movies have acknowledged the notion of a sort of superhero team—the Fantastic Four. And the Fantastic Four acquire powers, so for them to live in a world where mutants are prevalent is kind of complicated, because you're like, 'Oh, you're just a mutant.' Like, 'What's so fantastic about you?' ... they live in discrete universes.\"[368] In July 2015, X-Men director Bryan Singer said that there was still potential for a crossover between the X-Men and Fantastic Four franchises, if reactions to Fantastic Four and X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) warranted it.[369]\n\nFeeling that Singer's efforts in Apocalypse to establish a larger world, similar to the MCU, did not meet the standards established by Marvel, VanDerWerff noted that unlike Feige's ability to serve as \"pseudo-showrunner\", Singer is instead \"steeped in film and the way movie stories have always been told\", so \"when it comes time to have Apocalypse dovetail with story threads from the earlier X-Men: First Class\", which was directed by Matthew Vaughn, \"both Singer's direction and Simon Kinberg's script rely on hackneyed devices and clumsy storytelling\", indicating a lack of \"the kind of big-picture thinking this sort of mega franchise requires\".[331] In his review of Dark Phoenix, Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal characterized the entire X-Men film series as being a \"notoriously erratic franchise\".[370] In March 2019, the film rights of Deadpool, the X-Men characters, and the Fantastic Four characters returned to Marvel Studios following the Walt Disney Company's acquisition of 21st Century Fox.[54][55]\n\nIn November 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal announced that the studio intended to expand their universe created within director Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films (2012–14), with spin-off adventures for supporting characters, in an attempt to replicate Marvel and Disney's model.[367] The next month, Sony announced Venom and Sinister Six films, both set in the Amazing Spider-Man universe. With this announcement, IGN stated that the spin-offs are \"the latest example of what we can refer to as \"the Avengers effect\" in Hollywood, as studios work to build interlocking movie universes.\"[371] Sony chose not to replicate the Marvel Studios model of introducing individual characters first before bringing them together in a team-up film, instead making the Spider-Man adversaries the stars of future films.[355] In February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that the Spider-Man franchise would be retooled, with a new film co-produced by Feige and Pascal being released in July 2017, and the character being integrated into the MCU. Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, own, and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films.[372] With this announcement, sequels to The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) were canceled,[373] and by November 2015 the Venom and Sinister Six films, as well as spin-offs based on female characters in the Spider-Man universe, were no longer moving forward.[373][374] By March 2016, the Venom film had itself been retooled, to start its own franchise unrelated to the MCU Spider-Man.[375] A year later, Sony officially announced the Venom film to be in development, for an October 5, 2018, release,[376] along with a film centered on the characters Silver Sable and Black Cat known as Silver & Black.[377] Both projects were not intended to be a part of the MCU nor spin-offs to Spider-Man: Homecoming, but rather part of an intended separate shared universe known as the Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU).[377][378][379] The mid-credits scene of Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021) hinted at Eddie Brock / Venom joining the MCU,[380] which was confirmed with the release of Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) through an uncredited cameo appearance in its mid-credits scene.[381] Spider-Man: No Way Home also featured the Spider-Man iterations from Sam Raimi and Webb's Spider-Man films, respectively reprised by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield.[382]\n\nAfter Sony canceled their shared universe plans and started sharing the Spider-Man character with Marvel Studios, multiple critics discussed their failure at replicating the MCU. Scott Meslow of The Week noted the perceived flaws of the first Amazing Spider-Man film, outside of its lead performances, and how the sequel \"doubles down on all the missteps of the original while adding a few of its own. ...We now have a textbook example of how not to reboot a superhero franchise, and if Sony and Marvel are wise, they'll take virtually all those lessons to heart as they chart Spider-Man's next course.\"[383] Scott Mendelson noted that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 \"was sold as less a sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man than a backdoor pilot for Spider-Man vs. the Sinister Six. ...Had Sony stuck with the original plan of a scaled-down superhero franchise, one that really was rooted in romantic drama, they would have at least stuck out in a crowded field of superhero franchises. When every superhero film is now going bigger, Amazing Spider-Man could have distinguished itself by going small and intimate.\" This would have saved Sony \"a boatload of money\", and potentially reversed the film's relative financial failure.[384]\n\nIn September 2014, the University of Baltimore announced a course beginning in the 2015 spring semester revolving around the Marvel Cinematic Universe, to be taught by Arnold T. Blumberg. \"Media Genres: Media Marvels\" examines \"how Marvel's series of interconnected films and television shows, plus related media and comic book sources and Joseph Campbell's monomyth of the 'hero's journey', offer important insights into modern culture\" as well as Marvel's efforts \"to establish a viable universe of plotlines, characters, and backstories.\"[385][386]\n\nAfter the acquisition by Disney in 2009, Marvel films began to be marketed at the Innoventions attraction in Tomorrowland at Disneyland. For Iron Man 3, the exhibit, entitled \"Iron Man Tech Presented by Stark Industries\", featured the same armor display that was shown at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, with the Marks I-VII and the new Mark XLII. In addition, there was a simulator game, titled \"Become Iron Man\", that used Kinect-like technology to allow the viewer to be encased in an animated Mark XLII armor and take part in a series of \"tests\", in which you fire repulsor rays and fly through Tony Stark's workshop. The game was guided by J.A.R.V.I.S., who is voiced again by Paul Bettany. The exhibit also had smaller displays that included helmets and chest pieces from the earlier films and the gauntlet and boot from an action sequence in Iron Man 3.[387] The exhibit for Thor: The Dark World was called \"Thor: Treasures of Asgard\", and featured displays of Asgardian relics and transports guests to Odin's throne room, where they were greeted by Thor.[388] Captain America: The Winter Soldier's exhibit, \"Captain America: The Living Legend and Symbol of Courage\", featured a meet and greet experience.[389]\n\nFrom May to September 2017, Disneyland Resort featured the \"Summer of Heroes\", which features members of the Guardians and Avengers appearing throughout the Disneyland Resort. Additionally, the Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Dance Off event was featured, which involved Peter Quill / Star-Lord blasting music from his boombox, along with the Avengers Training Initiative, a limited experience where Black Widow and Hawkeye \"assemble a group of young recruits to see if they have what it takes to be an Avenger.\" Marvel-related food and merchandise was also available throughout Hollywood Land at Disney California Adventure during the \"Summer of Heroes\".[390]\n\nIn March 2018, the Walt Disney Company announced three new Marvel-themed areas inspired by the MCU to Disney California Adventure, Walt Disney Studios Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland. The developments will be designed by Walt Disney Imagineering in collaboration with Marvel Studios and Marvel Themed Entertainment.[391] As was established with Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout!, Avengers Campus exists in its own theme park universe that is inspired by the MCU.[392][393] Being in the MCU multiverse, Avengers Campus has a shared history with the MCU proper, with a few notable exceptions being the Blip from Avengers: Infinity War did not occur, and some characters who died, such as Tony Stark, are still alive.[393]\n\nIn October 2013, the Iron Man Experience attraction was announced for Hong Kong Disneyland.[394] It is set in the Tomorrowland section of the park,[395] with the area built to look like a new Stark Expo created by Tony Stark after the 2010 one, as seen in Iron Man 2,[396] with various exhibit halls that include the Mark III armor from the films.[395][397] The area also has Iron Man and Marvel-themed merchandise items and memorabilia, plus an interactive game where guests can have the chance to try on Iron Man's armor.[398] Iron Man Experience sees guests assist Iron Man in defeating Hydra throughout Hong Kong,[395] and opened on January 11, 2017.[398]\n\nIn March 2018, the Walt Disney Company announced a new Marvel-themed area inspired by the MCU to Hong Kong Disneyland and a new attraction where guests team up with Ant-Man and the Wasp, to join Iron Man Experience.[391][399] Inspired by Ant-Man and the Wasp,[400] Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle! is an enclosed interactive dark ride that sees guests use laser-powered weapons to team up with Ant-Man and the Wasp to defeat Arnim Zola and his army of Hydra swarm bots.[400][401] Ant Man and the Wasp: Nano Battle! replaces the Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters ride,[400] and opened on March 31, 2019.[402]\n\nBy San Diego Comic-Con 2016, the Tower of Terror at Disney California Adventure was set to be replaced by a new attraction, Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout!. Chris Pratt, Zoë Saldaña, Dave Bautista and Benicio del Toro all filmed exclusive footage for the attraction, reprising their roles as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax and Taneleer Tivan / The Collector, respectively.[403][404] James Gunn, director of Guardians of the Galaxy and its sequel, directed footage for the attraction and consulted on all aspects of it.[405] Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout! sees visitors assisting Rocket to rescue the other Guardians from the Collector's fortress, while the attraction features randomized events during the experience and music inspired by the Awesome Mix Vol. 1 soundtrack. The attraction opened on May 27, 2017.[390]\n\nIn March 2018, the Walt Disney Company announced a new Marvel-themed area inspired by the MCU at Disney California Adventure, anchored by Mission: Breakout!, that sees characters from the MCU such as Iron Man and Spider-Man join the Guardians of the Galaxy in a \"completely immersive superhero universe\". The area replaced the \"A Bug's Land\" area, which closed in mid-2018 to start construction on the Marvel area.[391][399] Tom Holland reprises his role as Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the attraction Web Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure, in which Parker has set up W.E.B. (the Worldwide Engineers Brigade) to inspire a new generation to use technology to save the world. Riders are recruited by Spider-Man into the initiative to stop his malfunctioning Spider-Bots.[406] Web Slingers was directed by Spider-Man director Jon Watts along with Brett Strong, and was written by Steven Spiegel and featured visual effects by Framestore.[407] A one-act version of Rogers: The Musical premiered at the Hyperion Theater on June 30, 2023, and ran for a limited time until August 31.[408]\n\nIn March 2018, the Walt Disney Company announced a new Marvel-themed area inspired by the MCU to Disneyland Paris' Walt Disney Studios Park. The area includes a reimagined attraction where riders team up with Iron Man and other Avengers on a \"hyper-kinetic adventure\" on July 20, 2022.[391][409] The park also hosted the \"Summer of Super Heroes\" live-action stage show from June–September 2018.[391][399]\n\nIn July 2021, the immersive family dining experience \"Avengers: Quantum Encounter\" at the Worlds of Marvel restaurant on the Disney Wish cruise ship was announced, which debuted when the cruise began voyages on July 14, 2022.[410][411] The experience takes place during dinner with interactive elements and a full CGI recreation of the Wish's upper decks.[412] Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, Brie Larson, Kerry Condon, and Iman Vellani reprised their MCU roles,[413][414] while Ross Marquand voiced Ultron after previously doing so in What If...?, in which he replaced James Spader.[413] Chris Waitt directed Rudd and Lilly's content, which was written by Steven Spiegel and featured visual effects by Framestore.[415][416] The Marvels director Nia DaCosta filmed Vellani and Larson's content in London ahead of principal photography for the film.[417]\n\nIn September 2023, the Wish's sister ship the Disney Treasure was announced to also include the Worlds of Marvel restaurant with two nights of distinct shows and menus, featuring an appearance by Spider-Man. The Marvel Super Hero Academy is also included on the cruise, where young kids can train to be superheroes with Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Ant-Man. These will be available on the Treasure when it begins voyages on December 21, 2024.[418]\n\nIn May 2014, the Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. (Scientific Training and Tactical Intelligence Operative Network) exhibit opened at the Discovery Times Square center. The exhibit features replica set pieces and props from the films, mixed with interactive technology and information, crafted through a partnership with NASA and other scientists. Titus Welliver also provides a \"debrief\" to visitors, reprising his role as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Felix Blake. Created by Victory Hill Exhibits, Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. cost $7.5 million to create,[419][420] and ran through early September 2015.[421]\n\nThe exhibit also opened in South Korea at the War Memorial of Korea in April 2015,[422][423] in Paris, France, at Esplanade de La Défense a year later, and in Las Vegas at the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino in June 2016.[423] The Las Vegas version of the exhibit featured updated character details and corresponding science to incorporate the Marvel films that were released since the original exhibit in New York. Additionally, the Las Vegas version features Cobie Smulders reprising her role as Maria Hill to \"debrief\" visitors, replacing Welliver.[424]\n\nAn art exhibit, titled Marvel: Creating the Cinematic Universe, was displayed exclusively at the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA) in Brisbane, Australia, in 2017. The exhibit, which included \"300 plus objects, films, costumes, drawings and other ephemera\", featured content \"from the collection of Marvel Studios and Marvel Entertainment and private collections\" with \"significant focus [given] to the creative artists who translate the drawn narrative to the screen through production design and storyboarding, costume and prop design, and special effects and post-production\". Marvel: Creating the Cinematic Universe was also extended to GOMA's Australian Cinémathèque with a retrospective of the MCU films.[425][426]\n\nIn October 2019, Marvel Studios and ILMxLAB announced the virtual reality experience Avengers: Damage Control. The experience would be available for a limited time starting in mid-October 2019 at select Void VR locations. Avengers: Damage Control sees players taking control of one of Shuri's Emergency Response Suits–which combine Wakandan and Stark Industries technologies–to defeat a threat alongside Doctor Strange, Ant-Man, and the Wasp. Letitia Wright, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Rudd, and Evangeline Lilly all reprise their MCU roles,[427] while Ross Marquand voices Ultron, replacing James Spader.[428] The experience was extended to the end of 2019.[429]\n\nIn May 2024, the Marvel Studios' Infinity Saga Concert Experience was announced by Disney Concerts, Marvel Studios, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, to premiere on August 30 and 31, 2024, at the Hollywood Bowl. The concert, conducted by the Philharmonic's Music and Artistic director Gustavo Dudamel, features the Philharmonic performing a \"specially created score\" of music from the Infinity Saga films, such as The Avengers theme and \"Portals\" from Avengers: Endgame, live to picture.[430] The first half of the concert focused on individual characters from the films, while the second half centered on Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. A \"post-credits scene\" saw the Philharmonic play Michael Giacchino's theme from The Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025).[431] The performance also utilized projection mapping on the proscenium of the Hollywood Bowl while audiences members wore PixMob light-up wrist bands.[430][432] The concert is set to go on tour globally in 2025.[431][432]\n\nOn March 18, 2014, ABC aired a one-hour television special titled Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe, which documented the history of Marvel Studios and the development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and included exclusive interviews and behind-the-scenes footage from all of the films, One-Shots, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and sneak peeks of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, unaired episodes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,[433] and Ant-Man.[434] Brian Lowry of Variety felt the special, \"contains a pretty interesting business and creative story. While it might all make sense in hindsight, there was appreciable audacity in Marvel's plan to release five loosely connected movies from the same hero-filled world, beginning with the cinematically unproven Iron Man and culminating with superhero team The Avengers. As such, this fast-moving hour qualifies as more than just a cut-and-paste job from electronic press kits, although there's an element of that, certainly.\"[435] The special was released on September 9, 2014, on the home media for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 1.[436]\n\nIn September 2014, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. executive producer Jeffrey Bell stated that to meet production demands and avoid having to air repeat episodes, ABC would likely air a Marvel special in place of a regular installment at some point during the first ten episodes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s second season.[437] In October, the special was revealed to be Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!, which was hosted by Emily VanCamp, who portrays Agent 13 in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and aired on November 4, 2014.[438] The special features behind the scenes footage from Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man, as well as footage from the Agent Carter television series previously screened at New York Comic Con.[439] Brian Lowry of Variety felt an hour for the special did not \"do the topic justice\" adding, \"For anyone who has seen more than one Marvel movie but would shrug perplexedly at the mention of Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko, Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp To Pop! should probably be required viewing. Fun, fast-paced and encompassing many of the company's highlights along with a few lowlights, it's a solid primer on Marvel's history, while weaving in inevitable self-promotion and synergistic plugs.\"[440] Eric Goldman of IGN also wished the special had been longer, adding, \"Understandably, the more you already know about Marvel, the less you'll be surprised by Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!, but it's important to remember who this special is really made for – a mainstream audience who have embraced the Marvel characters, via the hugely successful movies, in a way no one could have imagined.\"[439]\n\nThe special Expanding the Universe was released on Disney+ on November 12, 2019. It features a look at the original MCU TV series for Disney+, with interviews and concept art.[441]\n\nA Marvel-themed orchestra performance of an extended version of Brian Tyler's Marvel Studios theme and Alan Silvestri's theme from The Avengers took place during China's Bilibili New Year's Gala on December 31, 2020, to promote the 2021 Marvel Studios film releases.[442][443]\n\nA special titled Marvel Studios' 2021 Disney+ Day Special, which looked at the future of the MCU on Disney+, was released on the service on November 12, 2021, as part of its \"Disney+ Day\" celebration.[444][445]\n\nAnnounced in December 2020, this series examines individual heroes, villains, moments, and objects from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and how they connect, in anticipation of the upcoming stories that will feature them in Phase Four.[446][447] Marvel Studios: Legends premiered on Disney+ on January 8, 2021, with the release of the first two episodes.[446] Additional episodes were released ahead of a character and objects' appearances in Disney+ series and films.[446][448]\n\nAnnounced in February 2021, each special of the documentary series goes behind the scenes of the making of the MCU films and television series with cast members and additional creatives. Marvel Studios: Assembled premiered on Disney+ on March 12, 2021, with the release of the first special, followed by additional specials.[449]\n\nVoices Rising: The Music of Wakanda Forever is a three-part documentary series detailing the creation process of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's soundtrack. It premiered on Disney+ on February 28, 2023.[450] The documentary series was originally scheduled to be removed from Disney+ on May 26, 2023, as part of Disney's efforts to reduce content costs, but ultimately was decided to remain on the service at that time.[451]\n\nIn June 2021, Marvel Studios released a casting call for fans of \"Marvel's strong women\" to be a part of an unscripted Disney+ documentary series showcasing the women who create the MCU in front of and behind the camera, including actors and creatives, and the fans who applied to participate in the series.[452] The series was titled MPower by February 2023 and premiered in its entirety on March 8, 2023,[453] consisting of four episodes titled \"The Women of Black Panther\", \"Captain Marvel\", \"Scarlet Witch\", and \"Gamora\",[454] which were directed by Quinn Wilson and used archival footage and animation.[454][455] Its release coincided with International Women's Day.[456] Several MCU actresses were interviewed to discuss what makes their characters compelling to audiences, including Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong'o, Florence Kasumba, and Letitia Wright; Brie Larson, Iman Vellani, and Teyonah Parris; Elizabeth Olsen, Kathryn Hahn, and Kat Dennings; and Zoë Saldaña,[454] who executive produced the series alongside Victoria Alonso. Saldaña said the series was a tribute to the representation and empowerment of women with the intent to \"ignite meaningful conversations and drive real change towards a more equal and inclusive world.\"[454][457][455] Other creatives who were interviewed for episodes include Marvel Studios executive Trinh Tran, Black Panther costume designer Ruth E. Carter, production designer Hannah Beachler, and editor Debbie Berman.[458] The documentary series was originally scheduled to be removed from Disney+ on May 26, 2023, as part of Disney's efforts to reduce content costs, but ultimately was decided to remain on the service at that time.[451] The series was produced by Herzog & Co., Saldaña's production company Cinestar Pictures, and Just Entertainment.[455][457]\n\nAaron Perine at ComicBook.com believed that the series would have \"something for all fans to enjoy\" with each character's entry because of the fan appreciation,[454] while BJ Conagelo of /Film stated it was \"fantastic to see a thoughtful and in-depth spotlight\" of the work by diverse groups of women in the MCU, and found it was \"equally as impressive\" how much the series analyzed their impact as a \"sincere assessment\" of the importance of the stories beyond gender representation.[458] Philip Watson at CGMagazine said that while the series seemed focused on \"add[ing] depth\" to the backstories of the females behind Marvel, a secondary focus was to honor the title and empower women, quoting Kasumba: \"You could watch it and think 'people that look like me, we can be Super Heroes too'\".[459] Kai Young of Screen Rant felt that the series' exclusion of an episode focused on Scarlett Johansson's MCU character Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow was another \"insult against\" the character as she was \"pivotal to the MCU\", and had wanted such an episode to focus on developing Romanoff as an individual beyond her relationships with male characters and alongside her family.[456]\n\nIn September 2015, Marvel announced the Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, named as a nod to the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe. Each guidebook is compiled by Mike O'Sullivan and the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe team, with cover art from Mike del Mundo and Pascal Campion, and features facts about the MCU films, film-to-comic comparisons, and production stills. The guidebooks released each month from October 2015 to January 2016 were Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Iron Man, Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Incredible Hulk / Marvel's Iron Man 2,[460] Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Thor,[461] and Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Captain America: The First Avenger.[462]\n\nIn November 2018, Marvel and Titan Publishing Group released Marvel Studios: The First Ten Years to celebrate the first ten years of the MCU. It features cast interviews, in-depth sections on each film, and an Easter egg guide.[463] In October 2021, a two-volume book The Story of Marvel Studios: The Making of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was released, written by Tara Bennett and Paul Terry. This collection features a look at the evolution of Marvel Studios, personal stories from the 23-film \"Infinity Saga\", and interviews with cast and crew members.[464]\n\nIn April 2023, W. W. Norton & Company announced MCU: The Reign of Marvel Studios by Joanna Robinson, Dave Gonzales, and Gavin Edwards,[465] for release on October 10, 2023.[466] The book presents an unauthorized look at \"the rise and uncertain reign of the MCU, analyzing Marvel Studios' place as a major player in Hollywood and global pop culture\" from Marvel Studios' inception, through events in early 2023, conducted through numerous interviews with those closely associated with the MCU. Norton approached the writers to work on a book centered on the MCU in 2019. Robinson explained that the book was originally meant to be an oral history, until Disney was no longer enthused about the book's publication despite initially being open to it, and told current employees and former stars not to talk to the writers. The writers were able to supplement the interviews they were able to get with those from \"cultural critics and comics experts\" in addition to years of research. Robinson added that because of the long work put into the book, it was able to cover the studio's expansion to television on Disney+, as well as \"this current state of what I like to call a 'wobble' in Marvel's long reign\", and provide \"a lot of answers about how we got here\". Additionally, the book was not deterred by the then-recent firings of Alonso and Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter, needing only \"a few cosmetic tweaks to weave the whole story together\" with Robinson explaining those firings \"actually reinforced our sense that we really had captured the story of Marvel in both its triumphs and its stumbling blocks\".[465] Robinson was able to interview many of the subjects while Gonazles did the majority of the book's research, with Edwards compiling it all to give the book a \"flow\".[466]\n\nIn February 2024, Abrams Books announced Marvel Studios: The Art of Ryan Meinerding, written by Bennett and Terry. The book includes over 500 of Meinerding's illustrations, from work-in-progress to completed pieces, along with interview material where Meinerding discusses his process and working in Marvel Studios' visual development department. It was released on October 1, 2024.[467]\n\nIn February 2016, a commercial for Coca-Cola mini cans aired during Super Bowl 50. A Mini Marvel was created by Wieden+Kennedy for Coca-Cola through a partnership with Marvel, and was directed by the Russo brothers.[492][493] In the ad, Ant-Man (voiced by Paul Rudd, reprising his role) and the Hulk first fight, and then bond, over a Coke mini can.[492] Luma Pictures provided visual effects for the spot, having worked previously with the two characters in MCU films. For the Hulk, Luma redefined its previous muscular system and simulation process to create and render the character, while Ant-Man received new motion capture.[493] The Super Bowl campaign extended to \"limited-edition Coke mini cans [six packs] that are emblazoned with images of Marvel characters, including Hulk, Ant-Man, Black Widow, [Falcon, Iron Man] and Captain America.\" Consumers had the opportunity to purchase the cans by finding hidden clues in the commercial, though \"if the program goes well, Coke will consider making the cans available in stores.\"[492] The ad had the third most social media activity of all the film-related trailers that aired during the game,[494] and was nominated for Outstanding Visual Effects in a Commercial at the 15th Visual Effects Society Awards.[495]\n\nIn June 2021, The Simpsons short film The Good, the Bart, and the Loki was announced, which was released alongside \"Journey into Mystery\", the fifth episode of Loki on Disney+. The short sees Loki teaming up with Bart Simpson in a crossover that pays homage to the heroes and villains of the MCU. Hiddleston reprises his role as Loki in the short.[496]\n\n Category\n"

        "content": "\n\nMarvel Studios, LLC, formerly known as Marvel Films, is an American film and television production company. Marvel Studios is the creator of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), a media franchise and shared universe of films and television series produced by the studio, based on characters that appear in Marvel Comics publications. The studio was founded in 1993 by Avi Arad as part of Marvel Entertainment Group and has been led by producer Kevin Feige, who serves as its president since 2007. The studio originally licensed the film rights to several Marvel characters before beginning to produce its own films in 2004, and has since regained many of those rights. In 2009, the Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Studios' parent company Marvel Entertainment, and in 2015, they transferred Marvel Studios to the Walt Disney Studios, which has been a part of the Disney Entertainment division since 2023. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures has distributed most of the studio's films since The Avengers (2012).\n\nSince 2008, Marvel Studios has released 34 films within the MCU, from Iron Man (2008) to Deadpool & Wolverine (2024); 11 television series since 2021, from WandaVision (2021) to Agatha All Along (2024); and two television specials: Werewolf by Night (2022) and The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022). The television series What If...? (2021–2024) is the first animated property produced solely by the studio, through its \"mini-studio\" Marvel Studios Animation.[7] These films, television series, and television specials all share continuity with each other, along with five short films called Marvel One-Shots produced by the studio that were released from 2011 to 2014. From 2013 until 2020, Marvel Television released 12 television series, which also acknowledge the MCU continuity. These were produced before that company was folded into Marvel Studios in December 2019 and became a production label.\n\nEleven of Marvel Studios' films are among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time. These include: The Avengers, Iron Man 3 (2013), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Black Panther (2018), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Captain Marvel (2019), Avengers: Endgame (2019), Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), and Deadpool & Wolverine;[8] Avengers: Endgame was the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 until March 2021.[9][10] In addition to the MCU, Marvel Studios has also been involved with the production of other Marvel-based film franchises that have grossed over $1 billion at the box office, including the X-Men and Spider-Man multi-film franchises, as well as eight direct-to-video short films with Marvel Animation called Marvel Animated Features that were released from 2006 until 2011. Since 2024, Marvel Studios has used \"Marvel Television\" and \"Marvel Animation\" banners to release their television and animated projects, respectively.\n\nDuring what is known as Marvel's \"Timely era\", Captain America was licensed out to Republic Pictures for a 1944 serial film only for the free advertising. Timely failed to provide any drawing of Captain America with his shield or any further background, and Republic created a whole new background for the character and portrayed the character using a gun.[11] From the late 1970s through the early 1990s, Marvel Comics Group and Marvel Entertainment Group (MEG) sold options to studios to produce films based on Marvel Comics characters. One of Marvel's superheroes, Spider-Man, was optioned in the late 1970s, and rights reverted to Marvel without a film having been produced within the allocated time frame. From 1986 to 1996, most of Marvel's major characters were optioned, including the Fantastic Four, X-Men, Daredevil, the Hulk, Silver Surfer, and Iron Man.[12] Marvel's first big-screen adaptation of one of its properties was the 1986 film Howard the Duck,[13] which was a box-office bomb.[14] MEG was purchased by New World Entertainment in November 1986[15] and moved to produce films based on the Marvel characters. It released The Punisher (1989) before MEG was sold to Ronald Perelman's Andrews Group. Two other films were produced: Captain America (1990) released in the United Kingdom on screens and direct to video in the United States, and The Fantastic Four (1994), not intended for release.[16]\n\nFollowing a deal between MEG and ToyBiz in 1993, Avi Arad of ToyBiz was named president and chief executive officer (CEO) of both the Marvel Films division and New World Family Filmworks, Inc., a New World Entertainment subsidiary. New World was MEG's former parent corporation and later a fellow subsidiary of the Andrews Group.[17][18] Marvel Productions became New World Animation by 1993 as Marvel would start up Marvel Films, including Marvel Films Animation.[17][19][20] Marvel Films Animation shared Tom Tataranowicz with New World Animation as head of development and production.[21] New World Animation (The Incredible Hulk), Saban (X-Men: The Animated Series) and Marvel Films Animation (Spider-Man) each produced a Marvel series for television for the 1996–1997 season.[22][20][23] By the end of 1993, Arad and 20th Century Fox struck a deal to make a film based on the X-Men.[24] New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation were sold along with the rest of New World by the Andrews Group to News Corporation and Fox as announced in August 1996. As part of the deal, Marvel licensed the rights to Captain America, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer to be on Fox Kids Network and produced by Saban. New World Animation continued producing a second season of The Incredible Hulk for UPN.[22][25]\n\nOn August 7, 1996, Marvel Studios was created by Marvel. Filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise money to finance the new corporation, Marvel, Isaac Perlmutter's Zib, Inc. and Avi Arad sold ToyBiz stocks.[12][26] ToyBiz filed an offering of 7.5 million shares with a closing price of $20.125 at the time, making the offering worth approximately $150 million. ToyBiz sought to sell 1 million shares.[27] Jerry Calabrese, the president of Marvel Entertainment Group, and Avi Arad, head of Marvel Films and a director of ToyBiz, were assigned tandem control of Marvel Studios. Under Calabrese and Arad, Marvel sought to control pre-production by commissioning scripts, hiring directors, and casting characters, providing the package to a major studio partner for filming and distribution. Arad said of the goal for control, \"When you get into business with a big studio, they are developing a hundred or 500 projects; you get totally lost. That isn't working for us. We're just not going to do it anymore. Period.\"[12] Marvel Studios arranged a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox to cover markets in the United States and internationally.[28]\n\nIn December 1996, Marvel Entertainment Group underwent a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization plan, including Marvel Studios as part of its strategic investment.[29] By 1997, Marvel Studios was actively pursuing various film productions based on Marvel characters, including the eventual films X-Men (2000), Daredevil (2003), Elektra (2005), and Fantastic Four (2005). Unproduced projects included Prince Namor, based on the character Namor and to be directed by Philip Kaufman, and Mort the Dead Teenager, based on the comic book of the same name and written by John Payson and Mort creator Larry Hama.[30] Marvel's Captain America animated series with Saban Entertainment for Fox Kids Network was set to premiere in late 1998. However, due to the bankruptcy, the series was canceled after only character designs and a one-minute promotional reel were made.[31][32][33]\n\nThe first film packaged and licensed by Marvel Studios was Blade (1998), based on the vampire hunter Blade. The film was directed by Stephen Norrington and starred Wesley Snipes as Blade. It was released on August 21, 1998, grossing $70,087,718 in the United States and Canada and $131,183,530 worldwide.[34] Blade was followed by X-Men, which was directed by Bryan Singer and was released on July 14, 2000. X-Men grossed $157,299,717 in the United States and Canada and $296,250,053 worldwide.[35] Blade and X-Men demonstrated that widely popular films could be made out of comic book characters not familiar to the general public.[36] Leading up to X-Men's release, Marvel Studios negotiated a deal with then-functional Artisan Entertainment, successful with the low-budget The Blair Witch Project, for a co-production joint venture that included rights to 15 Marvel characters including Captain America, Thor (as a television series), Black Panther (with Snipes attached to produce and star), Deadpool, Iron Fist, Morbius, the Living Vampire, Longshot, Power Pack, Mort the Dead Teenager, Ant-Man,[37] and the Punisher.[38] Artisan would finance and distribute while Marvel would develop licensing and merchandising tie-ins. The resulting production library, which would also include television series, direct-to-video films, and internet projects, would be co-owned.[37] By 2001, the success of Marvel Entertainment's Ultimate Marvel imprint comics created leverage in Hollywood for Marvel Studios, pushing more properties into development.[39]\n\nThe next film licensed from Marvel Studios was Spider-Man (2002) by Columbia Pictures, directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man. The film was released on May 3, 2002, grossing $403,706,375 in the United States and Canada and $821,708,551 worldwide.[42] The early success of Spider-Man led the film's studio to issue a seven-figure advance for a sequel. Arad spoke of the deal, \"Movies make sequels. Therefore, it's a big economic luxury to know that a movie's going to get a second and third. This is a business of precedence.\"[43] According to a Lehman Brothers analysis, Marvel Studios made only $62 million for the first two Spider-Man films.[44] Marvel was making more from half the consumer product licensing fees while making relatively little from the films, but was enough for Marvel to regain its financial footing.[41] In October 2002, Marvel Studios announced deals for the Sub-Mariner and Prime with Universal Pictures.[45]\n\nIn contrast to the original storylines of DC Comics' Superman and Batman films, Marvel films often emphasized more fidelity to their comics, applying set pieces, scenes, plots, and dialogue drawn from them.[36] In 2003, David Maisel approached Arad about earning Marvel more for their films. Maisel, Arad, and Perlmutter met, leading to Maisel being hired as president and chief operating officer (COO). The studio's office was small on Santa Monica Boulevard, with around a dozen staff members. Kevin Feige, who later became the president of Marvel Studios, was then a junior executive generating script notes to the licensed studios.[41] In January 2003, Marvel, the Sci-Fi Channel, and Reveille Productions agreed to develop two pilot films based on Brother Voodoo and Strikeforce: Morituri.[46] In December 2003, Lionsgate purchased Artisan Entertainment and they decided to let all of the character rights Artisan held, except Punisher, revert to Marvel.[47][48]: 279  Marvel Studios partnered with Lionsgate in 2004 to produce eight animated films, called Marvel Animated Features, for the direct-to-DVD market with Lionsgate Home Entertainment handling distribution.[49][50] The line was a proof of concept for Maisel's later plan.[41] Eric Rollman was hired by Marvel as Executive Vice President of home entertainment & TV production for Marvel Studios to oversee the deal with Lionsgate.[51]\n\nMaisel was hired in 2004 as president and chief operating officer of Marvel Studios as he had a plan for the studio to self-finance its films.[40][41] Marvel entered into a non-recourse debt structure with Merrill Lynch that was collateralized by certain film rights to a total of ten characters from Marvel's vast vault. Marvel received $525 million to make a maximum of ten films based on the company's properties over eight years, according to the parameters of the original deal. Those characters were Ant-Man, the Avengers, Black Panther, Captain America, Cloak & Dagger, Doctor Strange, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, Power Pack, and Shang-Chi.[52] Ambac insured the films would succeed or they would pay the interest payment on the debt and get the film rights as collateral.[44] Initially, Marvel Studios was in talks with Universal Pictures as a possible distributor, because Universal owned the film rights to both the Hulk and Namor during that time.[53][54] Negotiations dragged on, so the studio began talks with Paramount Pictures. In the second quarter of 2005, Merrill attempted to back out of full financing of each film, demanding that Marvel finance one-third of the budget. Marvel took back rights in five foreign territories from Paramount for pre-sell to meet that demand.[41] In September 2005, Marvel announced the Merrill Lynch financing deal with Paramount was on as marketer and distributor. Marvel Studios' parent company Marvel Enterprises, Inc. then changed its name to Marvel Entertainment, Inc. to reflect the change to self-production.[52]\n\nThe studio moved to a new location over a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Beverly Hills, California. Maisel was also named vice-chairman of the studio, but reported to Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter.[41] In November 2005, Michael Helfant joined the studio as president and chief operating officer.[55] Also that month, Marvel gained the film rights to Iron Man from New Line Cinema. Marvel then revealed that it had regained the film rights to the Hulk from Universal in February 2006,[56] in exchange for letting Universal own the distribution rights to The Incredible Hulk (2008) and the right of first refusal to pick up the distribution rights to any future Marvel Studios-produced Hulk films.[57] In April 2006, Thor was announced to be a Marvel Studios production,[58] while Lions Gate Entertainment subsequently dropped the Black Widow film it had in development since 2004 and returned the rights to Marvel.[59]\n\nMaisel and Arad fought over the rate of film releases and the strength of characters in the film lineup. Perlmutter supported Maisel and thus, in May 2006, Arad quit as studio chair and CEO.[40][60] In March 2007, Helfant was \"forced out\" of the studio while Maisel was named chairman and Kevin Feige was named president of production to replace Helfant as Iron Man (2008) began filming.[61][62] In January 2008, Marvel Animation was incorporated to direct Marvel's efforts in animation and home entertainment markets including then animation efforts with Lionsgate and Nickelodeon.[51] In March, the company agreed to a five picture basic cable distribution with FX for the films Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, with additional films to be named later.[63] Following the successful opening weekend of Iron Man in May 2008, Maisel had his contract extended through 2010 and Feige was promoted to president of Marvel Studios.[64] In November, Marvel Studios signed a lease with Raleigh Studios to host its headquarters and production offices and film the next four films on the studios' slate, including Iron Man 2 (2010) and Thor (2011), at their Manhattan Beach Studios Media Campus facilities.[65] By September 2008, Paramount added five additional Marvel films' foreign distribution to its domestic film distribution contract.[66]\n\nIn 2009, producer Stephen Broussard was tasked with forming a writers program for the studio. The writers were hired for a year to be on call to do emergency script polishes for films in production,[48]: 165  as well as develop scripts based on some lesser-known properties, such as Black Panther, Cable, Iron Fist, Nighthawk, and Vision.[48]: 165 [67] Writers included: Edward Ricourt, who was encouraged to write a script for Luke Cage as it was of high interest to the studio;[48]: 165  Nicole Perlman, who chose to write a script based on the 2008 Guardians of the Galaxy team;[48]: 167  Christopher Yost, who was asked to pitch a Black Panther film for his interview,[48]: 166  and took interest in writing scripts about the Thunderbolts, Power Pack, and Brian Braddock / Captain Britain;[48]: 173  Joe Robert Cole, who initially pitched a War Machine film before joining the writers program where he created scripts for the Inhumans;[48]: 169  and Eric Pearson, who was asked to pitch a Cloak and Dagger film and also worked to rewrite a Luke Cage script.[48]: 171  After Broussard moved on to the production of Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Marvel Studios hired Nate Moore to oversee the writers program, who at times was assisted by the also newly hired executive Jodi Hildebrand. Particular properties Feige was interested in having screenplays for were Black Panther, Iron Fist, and Blade.[48]: 167–168, 171  The program was shut down in 2014 before being revived in 2016.[48]: 172  In early 2009, Sony returned all Spider-Man television rights (including live-action) in exchange for an adjustment to the film rights.[68]\n\nOn August 31, 2009, the Walt Disney Company announced that it had reached a deal to acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion.[69] The deal was completed on December 31, with Marvel Entertainment becoming a subsidiary of Disney.[70] Both Marvel and Disney stated that the merger would not affect any pre-existing deals with other film studios for the time being,[71] although Disney said they would distribute future Marvel projects with their own studio once the deals expired.[72] Maisel stepped down from the studio following the sale to Disney.[73] In April 2010, rumors circulated that Marvel was looking to create $20–40 million films based on properties such as Doctor Strange, Ka-Zar, Luke Cage, Dazzler, and Power Pack.[74] Feige responded by saying, while budgets are generally never discussed early in development, Marvel was considering films for all characters mentioned in the rumor, except Dazzler, whose rights were at Fox.[75]\n\nIn June 2010, Marvel Entertainment set up a television division within Marvel Studios called Marvel Television to be headed up by Jeph Loeb as Executive Vice President,[76] under which Marvel Animation would be operated.[77] In October, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures acquired the distribution rights for The Avengers (2012) and Iron Man 3 (2013) from Paramount Pictures[78] with Paramount's logo and credit remaining on those films.[79] In August 2011, at Disney's behest, the studio dismissed most of its marketing department, including EVP of Worldwide Marketing Dana Precious, VP of Worldwide Marketing Jeffrey Stewart, and Manager of Worldwide Marketing Jodi Miller. Disney subsequently began marketing Marvel's films.[80] In April 2012, the Walt Disney Company China, Marvel Studios, and DMG Entertainment announced an agreement to co-produce Iron Man 3 in China. DMG partly financed, produced in China with Marvel, and handled co-production matters. DMG also distributed the film in China in tandem with Disney.[81]\n\nIn April 2013, Marvel Studios moved its executive production offices from the Manhattan Beach Studios Media Campus to the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California.[82] In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger from Paramount.[83][84] In September 2014, TNT acquired the cable rights for Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), and three other films, to air on the network two years after their theatrical releases. The films had previously aired on FX since 2008.[85]\n\nIn August 2015, Marvel Studios was placed into Walt Disney Studios, with Feige reporting directly to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter. Marvel Television and subsidiary Marvel Animation were left under Marvel Entertainment and Perlmutter's control.[86][87] As of April 2017, Marvel Studios was housed on the second floor of the Frank G. Wells Building at the Disney studio lot.[1][2] Fast Company ranked Marvel Studios number eleven on its 2018 World's Most Innovative Companies list.[88]\n\nIn September 2018, it was reported that Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for the streaming service Disney+, to be centered on \"second tier\" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own films. Characters being considered for series included Loki and Scarlet Witch, with the actors who portrayed the characters in the films expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes, with a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio productions\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development.[89] In October 2019, Feige was given the title of Chief Creative Officer, Marvel, and would oversee the creative direction of Marvel Television and Marvel Family Entertainment, with both being returned to being under the Marvel Studios banner.[90] Two months later, Marvel Television was folded into Marvel Studios, with Marvel Studios overseeing development of all the Marvel Television series in production at the time of its closing. Karim Zreik, Marvel Television's senior vice president of current programming and production, would join Marvel Studios alongside his team to oversee the production of the Marvel Television series inherited by Marvel Studios.[91]\n\nIn May 2022, Marvel Studios signed a 20-year licensing deal with Stan Lee Universe to license the name and likeness of Lee for use in future films, television series, Disney theme parks and cruises, various \"experiences\", and merchandising. A digitally recreated Lee was not expected to make cameo appearances in future projects, rather the deal allows Marvel to use Lee's name, voice, likeness, signature, and existing images and archival material.[92] In June 2023, the distribution rights to The Incredible Hulk reverted from Universal back to Marvel and Disney.[93]\n\nBy October 2023, Marvel Studios was planning to hire dedicated executives to focus on their television efforts, as part of their larger plan to change their approach to their television series.[94] Production and development executive Richie Palmer was serving as a television executive by January 2024.[95] In May 2024, Marvel Studios revealed that its live-action Disney+ series would be released under a new \"Marvel Television\" banner, separate from the previous company of the same name, starting with Agatha All Along later in 2024.[96]\n\nIn June 2021, ahead of Marvel Studios' first solely produced animated series What If...?, executive vice president of film production Victoria Alonso noted that the studio was creating an \"animation branch and mini-studio\" to focus on more animated content beyond What If...?.[97] Marvel Studios outsources the animation for its animated series to third-party animation studios, though executive Brad Winderbaum indicated Marvel would work with fellow Disney studios Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios \"under the right circumstances\".[98] In September 2021, Alonso was promoted to President of Physical, Post Production, VFX and Animation.[99] In November 2021, Marvel Studios announced the animated series X-Men '97 (2024–present), a revival of X-Men: The Animated Series (1992–1997) that is set in that series' continuity.[100] The animation branch of Marvel Studios and \"mini-studio\" is known as Marvel Studios Animation.[7] By April 2022, Marvel Studios had taken over production of the preschool animated series Spidey and His Amazing Friends, starting from its second season; the first season was produced under the Marvel Entertainment banner.[101] The \"Marvel Animation\" name and banner was used for the division's projects by May 2024.[96]\n\nIn March 2023, Alonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios by a group including Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman and Disney's human resources and legal departments for serving as a producer on the Amazon Studios film Argentina, 1985 (2022); this was a breach of a 2018 agreement between Alonso and Disney which stated employees would not work for a competing studio.[102][103] Alonso reportedly did not seek permission to work on the film, and was asked by Disney to stop working on the film, as well as not to promote or publicize it, with the situation \"deemed serious enough\" that Disney requested a new agreement be signed. Despite this, Alonso continued to promote the film following its September 2022 premiere, and was consistently reminded of her agreement and breach of contract, ultimately leading to her firing.[102] Alonso's lawyers refuted this claim, stating Disney was aware of, and agreed to, Alonso's work on Argentina, 1985, and that she was instead \"silenced[... and] was terminated when she refused to do something she believed was reprehensible\";[104] this incident was reported to be a disagreement with a Disney executive over the censoring of gay pride elements in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) to release the film in Kuwait and comply with its restrictive anti-LGBTQ laws.[105][106] A Disney spokesperson reiterated the notion that she was fired due to \"an indisputable breach of contract and a direct violation of company policy\" among other \"key factors\".[104] Disney and Alonso reached a multimillion-dollar compensation settlement in April.[107]\n\nAlso at the time of Alonso's firing, criticism from VFX workers was noted,[103] who had raised complaints of Marvel's \"demanding post-production schedules\". Alonso was described by some as a \"kingmaker\",[103][7] and \"challenging to work with\",[105] with Chris Lee at Vulture reporting that Alonso was \"singularly responsible for Marvel's toxic work environment\" with VFX workers.[108][7] Alonso reportedly took days off to produce Argentina, 1985 instead of her post-production commitments for the various MCU projects, which in turn resulted in the need to delay several projects in 2022 and 2023.[105] However, Alonso was also described as the \"epitome of professional\" and supportive on set, with Joanna Robinson of The Ringer describing the reports as a \"gross mischaracterization\" and the opposite of Alonso's work.[103][109] Following Alonso's firing, visual effects vendors for the various MCU projects were working with producer Jen Underdahl, the vice president of visual effects and stereo.[102][110]\n\nIn August 2023, a group of 52 on-set VFX workers at Marvel Studios filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board for an election to join the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) labor union the VFX Union. This was the first time any workers in the visual effects industry had petitioned for union recognition. Lee believed if this group of workers were able to secure union recognition, it \"would stand as proof of concept for the overall viability of an industry-wide unionization push\", particularly at the post-production effect houses.[111] All of the workers who participated in the election vote that concluded in early September voted unanimously to form a union with IATSE, with the union then set to enter into collective bargaining negotiations with Marvel, beginning at an unspecified date.[112]\n\nMarvel had licensed out the film rights to many of their characters to other studios in the 1990s, starting with the X-Men,[24] the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, and Daredevil, which were followed by Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Black Widow, Luke Cage, the Punisher, Blade, Ghost Rider, Man-Thing, Black Panther, Deadpool, and Prime, among others.[45][113]\n\nIn February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that Spider-Man would appear in the MCU, with the character appearing in Captain America: Civil War (2016) and Sony releasing Spider-Man: Homecoming, produced by Feige and Amy Pascal, in July 2017. As part of the deal, Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films.[114] In June 2015, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal did not allow Spider-Man to appear in any of the MCU television series, as it was \"very specific... with a certain amount of back and forth allowed.\"[115] In September 2019, it was announced that Disney and Sony had reached a new agreement allowing for Spider-Man to appear in a third standalone film (produced by Marvel Studios and Feige) and a future Marvel Studios film.[116] Disney was reported to be co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of the film's profits in the new agreement, while retaining the merchandising rights to the character.[116][117] In November 2021, Pascal announced plans for a fourth Spider-Man film set in the MCU, in addition to long-term plans for a new trilogy of films with Marvel Studios, with said film entering active development the following month.[118][119] Sony's agreement specifies that production has to start on a film within three years and nine months of the previous one, and release within five years and nine months, otherwise the rights revert to Marvel.[48]: 295  Sony has access to 856 characters within their agreement,[48]: 297  including Kingpin, who is able to be used by both Sony and Marvel Studios.[120]\n\nIn March 2023, Citigroup financial analyst Jason Bazinet felt Disney may try to include the distribution rights to the Hulk and Namor in any potential sale of the streaming service Hulu to Comcast, the owner of Universal Pictures through NBCUniversal.[121] In June 2023, the distribution rights to The Incredible Hulk reverted from Universal back to Marvel and Disney.[93]\n\nThe following table details the rights that have returned to Marvel along with the studios from which they returned and the year in which they returned.\n\nThe \"Marvel Studios Parliament\", otherwise known as \"The Parliament\", is the creative decision-making committee at Marvel Studios and a \"brain trust\" of long-time executives who help to elevate each other's projects where possible.[150][151][152][94] The following executives are members of the Parliament:[153]\n\nA number of other executives serve as lead producers on films and television series, working on each project from their inception through their release as managers alongside other executives,[152][162] as part of the Production and Development group. Some of these executives include:[153]\n\nThe Visual Development group is an in-house group of artists who work on a film from its start to provide a consistent look for the studio.[157][additional citation(s) needed]\n\nIn addition to Meinerding, the group includes Andy Park, Director of Visual Development and Production Illustrator[172][173]\n\nAdditionally, Sarah Halley Finn has served as a frequent casting director for several MCU films and television series.[179]\n\nStarting with the release of Spider-Man in 2002, Marvel Studios introduced its \"flipbook\" production logo, created by Imaginary Forces.[191] This logo was accompanied by music from the film's score, sound effects or a song, to lead into the beginning of the film. This was the logo seen in front of all of the studio's films until 2013, when the logo was updated with the release of Thor: The Dark World, again created by Imaginary Forces. Feige stated that since Marvel was now their own entity within the Walt Disney Company, it \"felt like the time to update it and have something that is more substantial as a standalone logo in front of our features\" instead of having it be accompanied by Marvel's studio or distribution partners' logos. Feige added that they \"didn't want to re-invent the wheel [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel.\"[192] Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002. They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, and ultimately chose 120 that were \"universal and not specific to one character\" and created a narrative \"where each image spoke to the one before it and after.\"[191] The new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe through Captain America: Civil War. With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed by Brian Tyler, who wrote the scores to Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and Avengers: Age of Ultron.[192] It was featured on the films Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and Guardians of the Galaxy (2014).\n\nIn July 2016, another new logo and opening were introduced, featuring an updated fanfare, composed this time by Michael Giacchino, who first worked with Marvel Studios on the score to Doctor Strange (2016). The new opening begins with comic book panels seen in the previous two openings but transitions into footage and art of the characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films.[193] It was first seen in front of Doctor Strange.[194] The updated logo was created by Perception, which was first approached in January 2016 by Marvel to update their logo. Feige specifically requested Perception \"to combine the brand and the iconic characters into a single image, showcasing the heroes within the letterforms of the Marvel logo.\" The Perception team settled on a concept they dubbed \"How to Build a Universe\", which \"was designed to pay tribute to [the filmmaking] process by touching on\" how a film's origins are inspired by the comics, which then results in a script, followed by concept art, resulting in the final film. Perception looked to the initial \"flipbook\" logo for inspiration, and paid tribute to it in the new opening, as it opens identically to the flipbook logo. Next, the opening includes \"various lines lifted directly from the script pages of various Marvel screenplays\", with Perception picking \"both iconic fan-favorites, as well as lines that helped establish the breadth of the Marvel Universe.\" To add in the concept art images, Perception looked \"through a massive archive of concept art and \"The Art Of...\" books, to select the most iconic images for each beloved character. Utilizing the original digital paintings themselves, the Perception team animated each image being painted from scratch. The final touch was mapping this artwork onto 3D models to giving these once 2D paintings a sense of depth as the camera moves around them.\" Finally, over 70 pieces of footage from the 13 films that had been released at that time were included, with Perception arranging them in a way they called the \"vault\" \"where luminescent footage plays on the interior walls of the \"Marvel\" logotype.\"[195]\n\nA modified version of Perception's logo was introduced at the 2017 D23 Expo to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the MCU.[196] The logo debuted with Avengers: Infinity War on April 26, 2018, and was used again in Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018). With the release of Captain Marvel, the current Perception logo was altered at Marvel Studios' behest in honor of Stan Lee; Lee died on November 12, 2018, just a few months before the release of the film.[197] The logo was altered, replacing the characters with Stan Lee's MCU cameos and other public appearances related to the MCU, accompanied by a black screen reading \"Thank You Stan\".[198] Similarly, the logo was retroactively modified for the Disney+ version of Black Panther (2018) in honor of Chadwick Boseman, who died on August 28, 2020. The logo was altered, replacing the characters with images and footage of T'Challa and Boseman. The logo premiered on November 29, 2020, which would have been Boseman's 44th birthday.[199][200] Additional modifications include having the characters who disappeared in the Blip removed for Avengers: Endgame; an additional Boseman tribute one for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022); and an all-Guardians of the Galaxy opening for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023). A shortened sequence opening was used for the Disney+ series Secret Invasion (2023).[201] \"What If... Strange Supreme Intervened?\" (2023), the What If...? season two finale, replaced the live-action footage of the logo with animated images from What If...?.[202]\n\nTelevision specials from Marvel Studios, which are marketed as \"Marvel Studios Special Presentation\", feature a special multicolored intro with bongo drum music, reminiscent of the CBS Special Presentation theme featured before animated holiday specials of the 1980s and 1990s.[203][204] The intro was also designed by Perception,[205] with Giacchino (who directed and composed for the special Werewolf by Night) once again creating the music.[204] Jamie Lovett at ComicBook.com called the Marvel Studios Special Presentation intro \"more colorful\" and its fanfare \"more playful\" than the normal Marvel Studios intro.[206]\n\n‡—Includes theatrical reissue(s).\n\nMarvel Knights was a production arm of Marvel Studios intended to be used to produce some of Marvel's darker and lesser-known titles. The name originated from the \"Marvel Knights\" imprint of Marvel Comics. The first film produced under the Marvel Knights banner was Punisher: War Zone (2008), which served as a reboot of the Punisher franchise. This was followed by Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011), which was the second and final title to be released under the Marvel Knights banner.[209]\n"

Directed by Jon Favreau from a screenplay by the writing teams of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, the film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Leslie Bibb, and Shaun Toub. In the film, following his escape from captivity by a terrorist group, world-famous industrialist and master engineer Stark builds a mechanized suit of armor and becomes the superhero Iron Man.\n\nA film featuring Iron Man was in development at Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and New Line Cinema at various times since 1990 before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2005. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006 and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March to June 2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from numerous other superhero stories that are set in New York City. During filming, the actors were free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armor, created by Stan Winston's company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the title character.\n\nIron Man premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the United States on May 2, as the first film in Phase One of the MCU. It grossed over $585 million, becoming the eighth-highest grossing film of 2008, and received praise from critics, especially for Downey's performance as well as Favreau's direction, the visual effects, action sequences, and writing. The American Film Institute selected it as one of the ten best films of 2008. It received two nominations at the 81st Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. In 2022, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Two sequels have been released: Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013).\n\nTony Stark, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his late father Howard Stark, tours in war-torn Afghanistan with his best friend and military liaison, James Rhodes, to demonstrate the new \"Jericho\" missile. After the demonstration, his convoy is ambushed by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings and Stark is gravely wounded by a missile used by the attackers—one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by the Ten Rings. Yinsen, a fellow captive and doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen believe that Raza will not keep his word.\n\nStark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and construct a prototype armored suit to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden, the Ten Rings discover their intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit powers up. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will cease manufacturing weapons. Obadiah Stane, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this will bankrupt Stark Industries and ruin his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for it and his chest after testing a prototype. Personal assistant Pepper Potts places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, a suspicious Stark decides to keep his work to himself.\n\nAt a charity event, reporter Christine Everhart informs Stark that his company's weapons were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he fends off the terrorists and saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is intercepted by the Air Force. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who has been trafficking arms to the Ten Rings and has staged a coup to replace Stark as Stark Industries' CEO by hiring the Ten Rings to kill him. He subdues Raza and has him and the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new armor suit reverse-engineered from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged when they realized they had a direct route to Stark's weapons. Potts meets with Agent Phil Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D., an intelligence agency, to inform him of Stane's activities.\n\nStane's scientists are unable to duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane enters Stark’s home and steals the one from his chest. Stark manages to replace it with his original reactor. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and overpowers them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, where Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane to fall into the reactor and he is killed in the explosion. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed \"Iron Man\".\n\nIn a post-credits scene, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury visits Stark at home, telling him that he has become part of a \"Bigger Universe\", and that he wants to discuss the \"Avenger Initiative\".\n\nAdditionally, Faran Tahir appears as Raza, the leader of the Ten Rings;[28] Paul Bettany voices J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark's personal AI system;[29] and Clark Gregg appears as Phil Coulson, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.[30] Will Lyman provides the voice-over during the opening award ceremony.[31] Director Jon Favreau plays Harold \"Happy\" Hogan, Stark's bodyguard and chauffeur,[13] and Samuel L. Jackson makes a cameo appearance as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., in a post-credits scene.[32] Jackson's face was previously used as the model for the Ultimate Marvel imprint version of Nick Fury.[33] Other cameos in the film include Stan Lee as himself, being mistaken for Hugh Hefner by Stark at a party;[34] Peter Billingsley as William Ginter Riva, a scientist who works for Stane;[35] Tom Morello, who provided guitar music for the film, as a terrorist guard;[36] and Jim Cramer as himself.[37] Ghostface Killah, who often adopted Iron Man's name as an alias, had a cameo in a scene where Stark stays in Dubai, but the scene was cut for pacing reasons.[38]\n\nIn April 1990, Universal Pictures bought the rights to develop Iron Man for the big screen,[39] with Stuart Gordon to direct a low-budget film based on the property.[15] By February 1996, 20th Century Fox had acquired the rights from Universal.[40] In January 1997, Nicolas Cage expressed interest in portraying the character,[41] while in September 1998, Tom Cruise expressed interest in producing as well as starring in an Iron Man film.[42] Jeff Vintar and Iron Man co-creator Stan Lee co-wrote a story for Fox, which Vintar adapted into a screenplay. It included a new science-fiction origin for the character, and featured MODOK as the villain. Tom Rothman, President of Production at Fox, credited the screenplay with finally making him understand the character. In May 1999, Jeffrey Caine was hired to rewrite Vintar and Lee's script.[43] That October, Quentin Tarantino was approached to write and direct the film.[44] Fox sold the rights to New Line Cinema the following December, reasoning that although the Vintar/Lee script was strong, the studio had too many Marvel superheroes in development, and \"we can't make them all.\"[45]\n\nWe worked with Michael Crichton's researchers to find a grounded realistic way to deal with the suit. The idea was he needed the suit to stay alive. He's the same guy we used with Spider-Man 2 to come up with Doc Ock's inhibitor chips and what the arms are made of and how they work. ... Mandarin was an Indonesian terrorist who masqueraded as a rich playboy who Tony knew.\n\nBy July 2000, the film was being written for New Line Cinema by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio,[43][47] and Tim McCanlies.[48] McCanlies' script used the idea of a Nick Fury cameo to set up his own film.[43] In June 2001, New Line Cinema entered talks with Joss Whedon, a fan of the character, to direct,[49] and in December 2002, McCanlies had turned in a completed script.[50] New Line took a \"unique\" approach to writing the film's script, hiring David Hayter, David S. Goyer, and Mark Protosevich to \"sit in a room and simply talk on camera about Iron Man for a few days\". After this, Hayter was hired in 2004 to write a script.[51] He reworked scripts that had been written by Jeff Vintar and Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, which had included the villain the Mandarin and Pepper Potts as a love interest.[51][52] Hayter removed the Mandarin and instead chose to pit Iron Man against his father Howard Stark, who becomes War Machine. Hayter said \"you want to try to mirror your hero with your villain as much as possible\" for his reasoning behind making Howard the villain.[51] He also made Bethany Cabe the film's love interest over Potts.[52] In December 2004, the studio attached director Nick Cassavetes to the project for a target 2006 release.[53] However, this deal ultimately fell through, and Iron Man's film rights returned to Marvel.[51]\n\nIn November 2005, Marvel Studios worked to start development from scratch,[54] and announced Iron Man as their first independent feature, because the character was their only major one not already depicted in live action. Paramount Pictures was announced as Marvel's distribution partner for Iron Man.[12] According to associate producer Jeremy Latcham, \"we went after about 30 writers and they all passed,\" saying they were uninterested in the project due to both the relative obscurity of the character and the fact that it was solely a Marvel production. When the film did have a script, even the requests for rewrites met with many refusals.[55] Early scripts for the film also directly referenced Sony Pictures' Spider-Man 2 (2004) by identifying Stark as the creator of Otto Octavius's bionic arms.[56] In order to build the general public's awareness of Iron Man and elevate him to the same level of popularity as Spider-Man or Hulk, Marvel conducted focus groups, trying to find a way to remove the general perception that the character is a robot. The information Marvel received from the focus groups was used to formulate an awareness-building plan, which included releasing three animated short films ahead of the film's release. The shorts were called \"Iron Man Advertorials\", and were produced by Tim Miller and Blur Studio.[57]\n\nJon Favreau was hired to direct the film in April 2006,[58] celebrating getting the job by going on a diet, losing 70 pounds (32 kg).[15] Favreau had wanted to work with Marvel producer Avi Arad on another film after they both worked on Daredevil.[12] The director found the opportunity to create a politically ambitious \"ultimate spy movie\" in Iron Man, citing inspiration from Tom Clancy, James Bond, and RoboCop,[59] and compared his approach to an independent film—\"[i]f Robert Altman had directed Superman\"—and Batman Begins.[12][60] Favreau wanted to make Iron Man a story of an adult man literally reinventing himself after discovering the world is far more complex than he originally believed.[61] He changed the Vietnam War origin of the character to Afghanistan, as he did not want to do a period piece.[16] Art Marcum & Matt Holloway were hired to write the script,[58] while Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby wrote another version, with Favreau compiling both teams' scripts,[62] and John August then \"polishing\" the combined version.[63] Comic book staff Mark Millar, Brian Michael Bendis, Joe Quesada, Tom Brevoort, Axel Alonso, and Ralph Macchio were also called upon by Favreau to give advice on the script.[64] In May 2006, Arad left Marvel Studios to become an independent producer.[65] Because he was on staff when the deal was made for Iron Man, he retained producer credit on the film.[66]: 59  By July 2006, Matthew Libatique was attached to serve as cinematographer.[67]\n\nFavreau planned to cast a newcomer in the title role, as \"those movies don't require an expensive star; Iron Man's the star, the superhero is the star. The success of X-Men and Spider-Man without being star-driven pieces reassures [executives] that the film does have an upside commercially.\"[68] Those considered for the role included Jim Caviezel, Timothy Olyphant, and Sam Rockwell.[21] Rockwell was approached and was interested,[69] but Favreau then met with Robert Downey Jr., who he was convinced was the right actor for the role.[21] Favreau chose Downey, a fan of the comic, because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining \"The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark.\"[9] Favreau faced opposition from Marvel Entertainment executives in casting Downey,[21][70] but would not take no for an answer, saying, \"It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [and] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways.\"[70] Casting director Sarah Halley Finn suggested Downey create an audition tape to help persuade them. The executives were still not convinced, despite Favreau and Feige recommending Downey for the role, which resulted in Favreau leaking the news that Downey was in talks to the press; the positive reaction and enthusiasm to this story helped convince the executives,[21] with Downey cast in the role in September 2006.[71] Rockwell would later portray Justin Hammer in Iron Man 2 (2010).[69] Downey earned $500,000 for the role.[72] While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by Elon Musk. Downey said, \"Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with, or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans.\"[73]\n\nAdditional casting for the film occurred over the next few months: Terrence Howard was announced in the role of Stark's best friend James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes in October 2006.[74] He had been the first actor cast for the film;[21] Gwyneth Paltrow was cast as love interest Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts in January 2007;[75] and Jeff Bridges was cast in an undisclosed role in February.[76] Don Cheadle had also been approached for the role of Rhodes, and would eventually replace Howard in the role starting with the sequel, Iron Man 2.[77] Choosing a character to be the villain of the film was difficult, as Favreau felt Iron Man's arch-nemesis the Mandarin would not feel realistic, especially after Mark Millar gave his opinion on the script.[64] The Mandarin had originally been envisioned as a rival to Tony Stark with a building of his own right next to Stark Industries, with the Mandarin eventually drilling a hole underneath Stark Industries to steal all of Stark's technology for himself; associate producer Jeremy Latcham described such story as \"crazy terrible\" and \"underwhelming\".[78] Favreau felt only in a sequel, with an altered tone, would the fantasy of the Mandarin's rings be appropriate.[79] The decision to push him into the background is comparable to Sauron in The Lord of the Rings,[60] or Palpatine in Star Wars.[79] Favreau also wanted Iron Man to face a giant enemy. The switch from Mandarin to Obadiah Stane was done after Bridges was cast in that role,[38] with Stane originally intended to become a villain in the sequel.[64] The Crimson Dynamo was also a villain in early drafts of the script,[13] including at one point combining the character with the Mandarin.[21] Favreau felt it was important to include intentional inside references for fans of the comics, such as giving the two fighter jets that attack Iron Man the call signs of \"Whiplash 1\" and \"Whiplash 2\", a reference to the comic book villain Whiplash, and including Captain America's shield in Stark's workshop.[80]\n\nFavreau wanted the film to be believable by showing the construction of the Iron Man suit in its three stages.[16] Stan Winston, a fan of the comic book, and his company, who Favreau worked with on Zathura, built metal and rubber versions of the armor.[22] The Mark I design was intended to look like it was built from spare parts. The back is less armored than the front, because Stark would use his resources for a forward attack. It also foreshadows the design of Stane's armor. A single 41-kilogram (90 lb) version was built, causing concern when a stuntman fell over inside it, though both the stuntman and the suit were unscathed. The armor was also designed to have only its top half worn at times.[22] Stan Winston Studios built a 3.0-metre (10 ft), 360-kilogram (800 lb) animatronic version of Iron Monger (Obadiah Stane),[22] a name which Obadiah Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earlier in the film as a reference, but is never actually used for the suit itself in the film. The animatronic required five operators for the arm, and was built on a gimbal to simulate walking.[22] A scale model was used for the shots of it being built.[38] The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype, with visible flaps.[38] Iron Man comic book artist Adi Granov designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders.[81] Granov's designs were the primary inspiration for the film's, and he came on board the film after he recognized his work on Jon Favreau's MySpace page.[60] Saunders streamlined Granov's concept art, making it stealthier and less cartoonish in its proportions,[22] and also designed the War Machine armor, but it was \"cut from the script about halfway through pre-production.\" He explained that the War Machine armor \"was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have had weaponized swap-out parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor,\" and that it \"would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence.\"[82]\n\nProduction was based in the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California.[83] Howard Hughes was one of the inspirations for the comic book, and the filmmakers acknowledged the coincidence that they would film Iron Man creating the flying Mark III where the Hughes H-4 Hercules was built.[22] Favreau rejected the East Coast setting of the comic books because many superhero films had already been set there.[16]\n\nFilming began on March 12, 2007,[84] with Matthew Libatique serving as director of photography.[67] The first few weeks of filming were spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan.[85] The cave where Stark is imprisoned was a 150-to-200-yard (140–180 m) long set, which had movable forks in the caverns to allow greater freedom for the film's crew.[16] Production designer J. Michael Riva saw footage of a Taliban fighter in Afghanistan, and saw the cold breath as he spoke: realizing remote caves are actually very cold, Riva placed an air conditioning system in the set. He also sought Downey's advice about makeshift objects in prison, such as a sock being used to make tea.[22] Afterwards, Stark's capture was filmed at Lone Pine, and other exterior scenes in Afghanistan were filmed at Olancha Sand Dunes, where the crew endured two days of 40-to-60-mile-per-hour (64–97 km/h) winds.[22] Filming at Edwards Air Force Base began in mid-April,[86] and ended on May 2.[87] In return for production assistance, the United States Department of Defense consulted on the film regarding certain scenes and dialogue depicting the military.[88] This included changing Stark from being opposed to arms deals, to instead becoming one who sells his technology to the U.S. military.[89] Exterior shots of Stark's home were digitally added to footage of Point Dume in Malibu,[38] while the interior was built at Playa Vista, where Favreau and Riva aimed to make Stark's home look less futuristic and more \"grease monkey\".[22] Filming concluded on June 25, 2007, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada.[90] Favreau, a newcomer to action films, remarked, \"I'm shocked that I [was] on schedule. I thought that there were going to be many curveballs\". He hired \"people who are good at creating action\", so \"the human story [felt] like it belongs to the comic book genre\".[15]\n\nThere was much improvisation in dialogue scenes, because the script was not completed when filming began (the filmmakers had focused on the story making sense and planning the action). Favreau felt that improvisation would make the film feel more natural. Some scenes were shot with two cameras to capture lines said on the spot. Multiple takes were done, as Downey wanted to try something new each time.[38] It was Downey's idea to have Stark hold a news conference on the floor,[15] and he created the speech Stark makes when demonstrating the Jericho weapon.[10] Downey improvised the film's final line, \"I am Iron Man\", which Feige felt was inline with the character's personality.[91] Bridges described this approach as \"a $200 million student film\", and noted that it caused stress for Marvel executives when the stars were trying to come up with dialogue on the day of filming scenes. He also noted that in some instances, he and Downey would swap characters for rehearsal to see how their own lines sounded.[92] Paltrow was less comfortable with improvisation, so Favreau would take notes on things she said during rehearsals or in off-handed moments that were in line with the character to incorporate into Potts' dialogue.[66]: 76 \n\nThe crew conceived a post-credits scene featuring Nick Fury and called Samuel L. Jackson to ask him if he would be interested in playing Fury, as Jackson had learned a few years earlier that his likeness had been used for Fury in the Ultimate Marvel comics imprint. However, according to Latcham, Jackson originally appeared without any deal for him to reappear in later films: \"It was just this weird idea that maybe people give a shi-- if we stick it on the end\".[78] The dialogue for the scene was also changed on set, with comic writer Brian Michael Bendis providing three pages of dialogue for the part, and the filmmakers choosing the best lines for filming on set.[64] It was filmed with a skeleton crew in order to keep the cameo a secret, but rumors appeared on the Internet only days later. Feige subsequently had the scene removed from all preview prints in order to maintain the surprise and keep fans guessing.[93] An alternate version of the Nick Fury post-credits scene was filmed in which he specifically mentions \"gamma accidents, radioactive bug bites and assorted mutants\", referencing Hulk, Spider-Man and the X-Men, but this was cut due to Sony Pictures and 20th Century Fox holding the respective film rights to Spider-Man and the X-Men at the time.[94]\n\nFavreau's main concern with the film's effects was whether the transition between the computer-generated and practical costumes would be too obvious.[95] He hired Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to create the bulk of the visual effects for the film after seeing Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End and Transformers. The Orphanage and The Embassy did additional work,[22] with the latter creating a digital version of the Mark I armor.[96] To help with animating the more refined suits, information was sometimes captured by having Downey wear only the helmet, sleeves and chest of the costume over a motion capture suit,[22] and skydivers were filmed in a vertical wind tunnel to study the physics of flying.[97] For shots of the Mark III flying, it was animated to look realistic by taking off slowly, and landing quickly. To generate shots of Iron Man and the F-22 Raptors battling, cameras were flown in the air to provide reference for physics, wind and frost on the lenses.[98] Favreau conceived of the head-up display shots so audiences would not become disconnected from Stark when watching scenes with the CG Iron Man.[66]: 81 \n\nWhen editor Dan Lebental started compiling an initial edit of the film in late 2007, it was quickly realized that the final act of the film was not working, as it was \"basically two robots punching each other\". They tried shortening the sequence, which did not help as it became \"both emotionally unsatisfying and abruptly anticlimactic\". Marvel rehired Marcum and Holloway, as all of the screenwriters had been released from their commitments at the end of filming, who suggested the act should call back to earlier in the film when Stark was learning that one of the limitations of the suit was it freezing at high altitudes. Favreau was hesitant to commit to this change, as it would cost an additional $6 million. However, the impending writers' strike forced him to move forward with this idea, with Marcum and Holloway submitting a draft of the ending on November 4, 2007, a day before the strike began. Given no further rewrites could occur because of the strike and Bridges unable to participate in shooting new material, ILM worked with as much previously-shot footage as possible to rework the film's ending.[66]: 82–84 \n\nComposer Ramin Djawadi had been a fan of the character Iron Man as a child, saying that he always liked superheroes \"that actually don't have any superpowers\". After Favreau's previous collaborator John Debney was unavailable to score the film,[99] Djawadi sought out the role himself.[100] Favreau had a clear vision of heavy metal music and guitars for the project,[100] saying that Tony Stark was more of a rock star than a traditional superhero.[101] Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra.[100] Djawadi had help with arrangements and additional cues from Hans Zimmer and Remote Control Productions,[100] and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who also makes a cameo appearance in the film, contributed guitar performances to the score.[36] The film also features a big band-style arrangement of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon The Marvel Super Heroes from frequent Favreau collaborators John O'Brien and Rick Boston.[102] A soundtrack featuring Djawadi's score was released by Lions Gate Records on April 29, 2008.[103]\n\nIn July 2006, with the film still in pre-production, Favreau and Arad attended San Diego Comic-Con to promote the film, where the film's armor design, drawn by Adi Granov, was revealed along with the announcement that the Mandarin was intended to be the antagonist of the film. The following year, Favreau returned to San Diego Comic-Con to once again promote the film with Downey and Feige, where a teaser trailer was shown. With much of the visuals not yet ready, Favreau worked with ILM to have the flying shots ready, saying \"I knew that I had to make a splash because there was zero anticipation for the film at the time\".[104] Stan Winston Studios also brought a life-sized replica of the film's armor to display at the convention.[105]\n\nMarvel and Paramount modeled their marketing campaign for Iron Man on that of Transformers.[106] In May 2008, Sega released an official tie-in video game based on the film on multiple gaming platforms. Downey, Howard and Toub reprise their roles from the film.[107] A 30-second spot for the film aired during a Super Bowl XLII break.[108] Hasbro created figures of armor from the film, as well as Titanium Man (who appears in the video game) and the armor from the World War Hulk comics.[109]\n\nThe 7-Eleven convenience store chain helped promote the film across the United States, and LG Group also made a sponsorship deal with Paramount.[106] Worldwide, Burger King and Audi promoted the film. Jon Favreau was set to direct a commercial for the fast-food chain, as Michael Bay did for Transformers.[106] In the film, Tony Stark drives an Audi R8, and also has an \"American cheeseburger\" from Burger King after his rescue from Afghanistan, as part of the studio's product placement deal with the respective companies. Three other vehicles, the Audi S6 sedan, Audi S5 sports coupe and the Audi Q7 SUV, also appear in the film.[110][111] Audi created a tie-in website, as General Motors did for Transformers.[106] Oracle Corporation also promoted the film on its site.[112] Several tie-in comics were released for the film.[113]\n\nIron Man premiered at the Greater Union theater at George Street, Sydney, on April 14, 2008.[114] The film began releasing in international markets on April 30,[115] and was released in the United States on May 2, 2008.[116] Iron Man was the first film released in Phase One of the MCU.[117] The film was re-formatted and screened in IMAX for the first time on August 30, 2018, as part of Marvel Studios' 10th anniversary IMAX festival.[118]\n\nThe film was released by Paramount Home Entertainment on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on September 30, 2008, in the United States and Canada, and October 27, 2008 in most of Europe.[119] DVD sales were very successful, selling over 4 million copies the first week and generating a gross of over US$93 million.[120][121] There were a total of 9 million copies sold and an accumulated total sales of over $160 million (not including Blu-ray).[120] For the home releases of the film, the image on the newspaper Stark reads before he announces he is Iron Man had to be altered because of amateur photographer Ronnie Adams filing a lawsuit against Paramount and Marvel for using his on-location spy photo in the scene.[122] A Walmart-exclusive DVD release included a preview of Iron Man: Armored Adventures.[123]\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One – Avengers Assembled\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[124] It was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on April 2, 2013.[125] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[126]\n\nIron Man earned $319 million in the United States and Canada and $266.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $585.8 million.[5]\n\nIn its opening weekend, Iron Man grossed $98.6 million in 4,105 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking first at the box office,[127] giving it the eleventh biggest-opening weekend at the time,[128] ninth-widest release in terms of theaters,[129] and the third highest-grossing opening weekend of 2008 behind Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and The Dark Knight. It grossed $35.2 million on its first day, giving it the thirteenth biggest-opening day at the time.[130] Iron Man had the second-best premiere for a non-sequel, behind Spider-Man, and the fourth biggest-opening for a superhero film.[131] Iron Man was also the number one film in the United States and Canada in its second weekend, grossing $51.2 million,[127] giving it the twelfth-best second weekend and the fifth-best for a non-sequel.[132] On June 19, 2008, Iron Man became that year's first film to pass the $300 million mark for the domestic box office.[133]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 94%, with an average score of 7.7/10, based on 282 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Powered by Robert Downey Jr.'s vibrant charm, Iron Man turbo-charges the superhero genre with a deft intelligence and infectious sense of fun.\"[134] On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 79 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[135] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[136]\n\nAmong the major trade journals, Todd McCarthy of Variety called the film an \"expansively entertaining special effects extravaganza\" with \"fresh energy and stylistic polish\",[28] while Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film, while nonetheless finding \"disappointment [in] a climatic  [sic] battle between different Iron Man prototypes ... how did Tony's nemesis learn how to use the suit?\"[137] In one of the first major-daily newspaper reviews, Frank Lovece of Newsday lauded the film's \"emotional truth ... pitch-perfect casting and plausibly rendered super-science\" that made it \"faithful to the source material while updating it – and recognizing what's made that material so enduring isn't just the high-tech cool of a man in a metal suit, but the human condition that got him there\".[138] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, praising Downey Jr.'s performance and stating, \"At the end of the day it's Robert Downey Jr. who powers the lift-off separating this from most other superhero movies\".[139] A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film \"an unusually good superhero picture. Or at least – since it certainly has its problems – a superhero movie that's good in unusual ways.\"[140] Among the specialty press, Garth Franklin of Dark Horizons commended the \"impressive sets and mechanics that combine smoothly with relatively seamless CG\", and said, \"Robert Downey Jr., along with director Jon Favreau ... help this rise above formula. The result is something that, whilst hardly original or groundbreaking, is nevertheless refreshing in its earnestness to avoid dark dramatic stylings in favor of an easy-going, crowd-pleasing action movie with a sprinkle of anti-war and redemption themes\".[141]\n\nAmong major metropolitan weeklies, David Edelstein of New York magazine called the film \"a shapely piece of mythmaking ... Favreau doesn't go in for stylized comic-book frames, at least in the first half. He gets real with it – you'd think you were watching a military thriller\",[142] while conversely, David Denby of The New Yorker gave a negative review, claiming \"a slightly depressed, going-through-the-motions feel to the entire show ... Gwyneth Paltrow, widening her eyes and palpitating, can't do much with an antique role as Stark's girl Friday, who loves him but can't say so; Terrence Howard, playing a military man who chases around after Stark, looks dispirited and taken for granted\".[143] IGN's Todd Gilchrist recognized Downey as \"the best thing\" in a film that \"functions on autopilot, providing requisite story developments and character details to fill in this default 'origin story' while the actors successfully breathe life into their otherwise conventional roles\".[144]\n\nRoger Ebert and Richard Corliss named Iron Man as among their favorite films of 2008.[139][166] It was selected by the American Film Institute as one of the ten best films of the year[167] and by Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.[168] Tony Stark was also selected by Empire as one of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time,[169] and on their list of the 100 Greatest Fictional Characters, Fandomania.com ranked him at number 37.[170] The Library of Congress selected Iron Man to be added to the National Film Registry in 2022, deeming it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Responding to the selection, Feige stated its inclusion on the Film Registry meant the film \"has stood the test of time and that it is still meaningful to audiences around the world\".[171]\n\n\n\nA sequel written by Justin Theroux and released in the United States on May 7, 2010, saw Favreau, Downey, Paltrow, Gregg, and Jackson returning. Don Cheadle replaced Terrence Howard in the role of Colonel Rhodes, who is also seen as War Machine. Also starring are Mickey Rourke as villain Ivan Vanko, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, and Scarlett Johansson as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Natasha Romanoff.[172] Walt Disney Studios and Marvel Studios released a second sequel on May 3, 2013,[173] with Favreau opting to direct Magic Kingdom instead, but still reprising his role as Happy Hogan.[174] Downey, Paltrow, and Cheadle also return, while Shane Black took over directing,[175] from a screenplay by Drew Pearce. Guy Pearce also starred as Aldrich Killian, and Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery.[176]\n"

        "content": "This is an accepted version of this page\n\n\nThe Incredible Hulk is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character the Hulk. Produced by Marvel Studios and Valhalla Motion Pictures, and distributed by Universal Pictures,[a] it is the second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It was directed by Louis Leterrier from a screenplay by Zak Penn, and stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner alongside Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson, Ty Burrell, and Christina Cabot. In the film, Banner becomes the Hulk as an unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate the \"Super-Soldier\" program through gamma radiation. He goes on the run from the military while attempting to cure himself of the Hulk.\n\nAfter the mixed reception to Universal's 2003 film Hulk, Marvel Studios reacquired the rights to the character, though Universal retained distribution rights. Leterrier, who had expressed interest in directing Iron Man for Marvel, was brought onboard and Penn began work on a script that would be much closer to the comics and the 1978 television series of the same name. In April 2007, Norton was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn's screenplay. His script positioned the film as a reboot of the series, distancing it from the 2003 film to give the new version its own identity. Norton was ultimately not credited for his writing. Filming took place from July to November 2007, primarily in Toronto, with additional filming in New York City and Rio de Janeiro. Over 700 visual effects shots were created in post-production using a combination of motion capture and computer-generated imagery to complete the film.\n\nThe Incredible Hulk premiered at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Universal City, California, on June 8, 2008, and was released in the United States on June 13, as part of Phase One of the MCU. It received praise for its action sequences and was considered an improvement over the 2003 film, but it was criticized as lacking in depth. The film grossed $265.5 million worldwide. After various production disagreements between Norton and Marvel Studios, such as over the final edit of the film, that Marvel Studios deemed not collaborative, Norton was replaced in the role of Banner by Mark Ruffalo for future MCU content starting with The Avengers in 2012.\n\nAt Culver University in Virginia, General Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross meets with Dr. Bruce Banner, the colleague and boyfriend of his daughter Betty, regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to gamma radiation. The experiment—part of a World War II-era \"super soldier\" program that Ross hopes to re-create—fails. The exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the Hulk, whenever enraged or when his heart rate rises above 200 beats per minute. The Hulk destroys the lab and surrounding area, and injures the General, Betty, and others outside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross, who wants to weaponize the Hulk.\n\nFive years later,[b] Banner works at a bottling factory in Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the internet, he anonymously collaborates with a colleague known only as \"Mr. Blue.\" He is learning yoga techniques to help keep control and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, which is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, giving him gamma sickness. Using the bottle to track down Banner, Ross sends a special forces team, led by Emil Blonsky, to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team, with Blonsky surviving. After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing powers but also begins to deform his skeleton and impairs his judgment.\n\nBanner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty. Banner is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, tipped off by Betty's boyfriend, Dr. Leonard Samson, causing Banner to again transform into the Hulk. The ensuing battle outside the university proves futile for Ross's forces, and they retreat, though Blonsky, whose sanity is faltering, attacks and mocks the Hulk. The Hulk severely injures Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue is actually cellular biologist Dr. Samuel Sterns, who tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse an initial transformation. Sterns reveals he has synthesized Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, to apply its \"limitless potential\" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply.\n\nA rapidly recovered Blonsky joins Ross's forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody. They succeed, and Banner and Betty are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and orders Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. The experiment mutates Blonsky into the Abomination, a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk. He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating as well. The Abomination rampages through Harlem. Realizing that the Hulk is the only one who can stop the Abomination, Banner convinces Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross's helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a battle throughout Harlem, the Hulk defeats the Abomination by nearly strangling him to death with a chain, but spares his life upon hearing Betty's plea and leaves the Abomination for Ross and his forces to arrest. After having a peaceful moment with Betty, the Hulk flees New York.\n\nA month later, Banner is in Bella Coola, British Columbia. Instead of suppressing his transformation, he begins to transform in a controlled manner with a slight smirk. Later, Tony Stark approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him that a team is being put together.[c]\n\nRobert Downey Jr. has an uncredited cameo as Tony Stark at the end of the film, reprising the role from the MCU film Iron Man (2008). Downey appeared as a favor to Marvel Studios, which he acknowledged as a smart move on Marvel's part, because when he was promoting his film he would also have to mention their other production.[40] Hulk co-creator Stan Lee cameos as a man who becomes ill when drinking the soda poisoned by Banner's blood. Michael K. Williams appears as a Harlem bystander, a role that was written for him by Norton, who is a fan of The Wire.[41] Paul Soles, who voiced Banner in the 1966 The Marvel Super Heroes animated series, appears as Stanley Lieber, a kindly pizza restaurant owner who helps Banner because he was good friends with him and Betty in the past. His name is a reference to Stan Lee's full name. Additionally, the late Bill Bixby appears, in a scene on his TV comedy-drama The Courtship of Eddie's Father on a television Banner is watching at the beginning of the film. Rickson Gracie has a small role as Bruce Banner's martial arts instructor; despite Gracie's Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu background, he is credited as an Aikido instructor. Brazilian actress Débora Nascimento makes a cameo as Martina, Banner's colleague at a beverage factory. Peter Mensah plays a small role as General Joe Greller, one of General Ross's military friends/associates.[39] Hulk supporting characters, Jim Wilson and Jack McGee, make cameo appearances as Culver University students played by P.J. Kerr and Nicholas Rose, respectively.[42] Martin Starr plays a college student, credited as \"Computer Nerd\". This character was retroactively revealed to be Roger Harrington, Starr's role in the MCU films Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), as confirmed in May 2019 by Feige.[43]\n\nAfter the release of Ang Lee's Hulk, screenwriter James Schamus was planning a sequel which would continue the story featuring the Grey Hulk. He was also considering the Leader and the Abomination as villains.[44] Marvel wanted the Abomination because he would be an actual threat to the Hulk, unlike General Ross.[45] During the filming of Hulk, producer Avi Arad had a target May 2005 theatrical release date.[46] On January 18, 2006, Arad confirmed Marvel Studios would be providing the money for The Incredible Hulk's production budget, with Universal distributing,[47] because Universal did not meet the deadline for filming a sequel.[9] Marvel felt it would be better to deviate from Ang Lee's style to continue the franchise, arguing his film was like a parallel universe one-shot comic book, and their next film needed to be, in Kevin Feige's words, \"really starting the Marvel Hulk franchise\". Producer Gale Anne Hurd also felt the film had to meet what \"everyone expects to see from having read the comics and seen the TV series\".[24]\n\nLouis Leterrier, who enjoyed the TV series as a child and liked the first film,[11][24] had expressed interest in directing the Iron Man film adaptation. Jon Favreau had taken that project, so Marvel offered him the Hulk. Leterrier was reluctant as he was unsure if he could replicate Lee's style, but Marvel explained that was not their intent.[48] Leterrier's primary inspiration was Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's Hulk: Gray (a retelling of the character's first appearance). He replicated every comic book panel that he pinned-up during pre-production, from the many comics he browsed, in the final film.[11] Leterrier said that he planned to show Bruce Banner's struggle with the monster within him,[49] while Feige added the film would explore \"that element of wish fulfillment, of overcoming an injustice or a bully and tapping into a strength that you didn't quite realize you had in yourself\".[50] Arad also said the film would be \"a lot more of a love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross\".[51] In May 2006, Arad left Marvel Studios to become an independent producer.[52] Because he was on staff when the deal was made for The Incredible Hulk, he retained producer credit on the film.[18]: 59 \n\nZak Penn, who wrote a draft of the first film in 1996, said the film would follow up Hulk, but stressed it would be more tonally similar to the TV show and Bruce Jones' run on the comic. He compared his script to Aliens, which was a very different film from Alien, but still in the same continuity.[15] He included two scenes from his 1996 script: Banner jumping from a helicopter to trigger a transformation, and realizing he is unable to have sex with Betty.[53] After the studio rejected a treatment by another screenwriter in 2006, Penn wrote three drafts before departing in early 2007 to promote his film The Grand.[54] Edward Norton began discussions to play Banner in April 2006, and arranged a deal that included him as both an actor and a writer, with a screenplay draft he was contractually obligated to turn in within a month. He did so, and continued to polish his draft as late as halfway through principal photography.[54] In November 2006, a June 13, 2008, release date was set.[55] Leterrier acknowledged the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America,[11] and that the film was a unique reboot, as generally audiences would have expected another forty-minute origin story.[56] There were previous discussions to set the first act in Thailand.[57] Leterrier felt audiences were left restless waiting for the character to arrive in Ang Lee's film.[56] Feige commented, \"we didn't want to tell the origin story again, because we thought people were so familiar with it, which is why we didn't tell that... One reason we made Incredible Hulk was to get Hulk into the [Marvel Cinematic Universe] canon.\"[58] The end of the film occurs at Columbia University, and Leterrier was interested in naming it Empire State University, as a reference to Peter Parker, but was unable to since Sony Pictures controls the film rights of Spider-Man.[59]\n\nShortly after the release of The Incredible Hulk, Gale Anne Hurd commented on the uncertainty of its relationship with Ang Lee's Hulk film. \"We couldn't quite figure out how to term this ... It's kind of a reboot and it's kind of sequel.\" Hurd said that \"requel\", a portmanteau of \"reboot\" and \"sequel\", was a \"perfect\" description for the film.[60] Norton explained his decision to ignore Lee's origin story: \"I don't even like the phrase 'origin story', and I don't think in great literature and great films that explaining the roots of the story doesn't mean it comes in the beginning.\"[14] \"Audiences know this story,\" he added, \"[so] deal with it artfully.\" He wanted to \"have revelations even in the third act about what set this whole thing in motion\".[16] The new origin story references Ultimate Marvel's take on the Hulk, which also had him created in an attempt to make super soldiers.[61] Norton removed Rick Jones and toned down S.H.I.E.L.D.'s presence.[24] He also added the scene where Banner attempts to extract a cure from a flower and his e-mailing with Samuel Sterns,[53] which references Bruce Jones' story.[62] Norton rewrote scenes every day.[26] Ultimately, the Writers Guild of America decided to credit the script solely to Penn,[63] who argued Norton had not dramatically changed his script. Journalist Anne Thompson explained \"The Guild tends to favor plot, structure and pre-existing characters over dialogue.\"[53] Penn said in 2008, \"I wasn't happy with [Norton] coming to Comic-Con saying that he wrote the script.\"[64] Before either Penn or Norton joined the project, an anonymous screenwriter wrote a draft and lobbied for credit.[53]\n\nLeterrier had to direct four units with a broken foot.[17] Filming began on July 9, 2007. Shooting primarily took place in Toronto, because mayor David Miller is a Hulk fan and promised to be very helpful to the crew when closing Yonge Street for four nights in September to shoot Hulk and Blonsky's climactic fight. Despite messing up the street with explosives and overturned burning vehicles, the crew would clean it up within twenty minutes so business could continue as normal each day.[65] The first action sequence shot was the Culver University battle, which was filmed at the University of Toronto and Morningside Park. The filmmakers built a glass wall over a walkway at the university for when the soldiers trap Banner inside to smoke him out.[30] There was also shooting in the Financial District.[37] A factory in Hamilton, Ontario, which was due for demolition, was the interior of the Brazilian factory. The site's underground floors were used for Ross's military command center.[65] The crew also shot part of the Hulk and Blonsky's fight on a backlot in Hamilton.[66] Other Canadian locations included CFB Trenton and a glacier in Bella Coola, British Columbia.[37] Afterwards, there was a week-long shoot in New York City and two weeks in Rio de Janeiro.[67] While there, the crew shot at Rocinha, Lapa, Tijuca Forest and Santa Teresa. Filming concluded in November after eighty-eight days of filming.[37]\n\nThe Incredible Hulk joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut carbon emissions and waste created during filming.[68] Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, was a popular environmental analogy, and Norton himself is an environmentalist. Hybrid and fuel-efficient vehicles were used, with low-sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced yellow pine instead of lauan for the sets, and also used zero- or low-VOC paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries.[37] The Incredible Hulk became the first blockbuster film to receive the Environmental Media Association's Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.[69]\n\nSeventy minutes of footage, mostly dealing with the origin, were not included in the final cut.[38] Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of including it in the final cut, and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet.[22] Editor Kyle Cooper, creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping pages) and the montage detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits.[22] Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to Hulk, had resulted in compressing these to the film's start.[38] This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice. Leterrier said he did not want this scene to be lost amid the opening montage.[38] Associate producer Stephen Broussard opined that the scene really worked, but given the test audience's dislike for such an opening, the filmmakers decided to move on from the planned opening and instead open the film with Bruce living in Brazil after a recap telling his origin story.[70]\n\nNorton and Leterrier disputed with the producers over the final running time: they wanted it to be near 135 minutes, while the producers wanted the film to be under two hours. This was made public, and rumors spread that Norton \"made it clear he won't cooperate with publicity plans if he's not happy with the final product\".[71] Norton dismissed this: \"Our healthy process [of collaboration], which is and should be a private matter, was misrepresented publicly as a 'dispute', seized on by people looking for a good story, and has been distorted to such a degree that it risks distracting from the film itself, which Marvel, Universal and I refuse to let happen. It has always been my firm conviction that films should speak for themselves and that knowing too much about how they are made diminishes the magic of watching them.\"[72]\n\nLeterrier cited Andy Serkis' motion capture portrayals of Gollum and King Kong in The Lord of the Rings and King Kong, respectively, as the standard he was aiming for.[48] Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's \"thunder claps\").[37] Phosphorescent face paint applied to the actors' faces and strobe lighting would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer.[73] Others including Cyril Raffaelli provided motion capture for stunts and fights,[27] after the main actors had done video referencing.[74] Leterrier hired Rhythm and Hues to provide the CGI, rather than Industrial Light & Magic who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's Hulk. Visual effects company, Image Engine, spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.[75] Overall 700 effects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements, but overall key frame animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary \"finesse [and] superhero quality\".[76] Many of the animators and Leterrier himself provided video reference for the climactic fight.[30]\n\nDale Keown's comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design.[48] Leterrier felt the first Hulk had \"too much fat [and] the proportions were a little off\". He explained, \"The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank.\"[48] Visual effects supervisor Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a linebacker rather than a bodybuilder. A height of nine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited flushing as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.[37] The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an olive or even gray slate.[73] His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for The Avengers film.[76] The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on Mike Deodato's art.[76] He originally had a crew cut, but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character.[74] Leterrier cited An American Werewolf in London as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change.[77] As a nod to the live-action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms.[78] Leterrier changed the Abomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of \"an über-human\" like the Hulk. Rather, his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles, and bones, creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab. His green skin is pale and reflects light, so it appears orange because of the surrounding fire during the climactic battle.[28] The motion capture performers, including Roth, tried to make the character behave less gracefully than the Hulk. They modeled his posture and the way he turns his head on a shark.[45] The character also shares Roth's tattoos.[79] A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character.[37] Leterrier tried to work in the character's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the example of Mike Tyson when he fought Evander Holyfield), and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across as stupid.[80]\n\nLeterrier had planned to use prosthetic makeup and animatronics to complement the computer-generated imagery that was solely used in the previous film.[81] The make-up artists who worked on X-Men: The Last Stand were set to portray Blonsky's gradual transformation,[26] which Zak Penn said would portray Blonsky \"not [being] used to having these properties. Like he's much heavier, and we talked about how when he walks down the sidewalk, his weight destroys the sidewalk and he's tripping. [It's all about] the humanization of these kinds of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually have on [them].\"[82] Tom Woodruff, Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (who created all the costumes for the Alien films since Alien 3) was in negotiations and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as stand-ins for the character. A full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic.[83] An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head, however.[66] Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The filmmakers used steam and dry ice for the gas used to smoke out the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked that making Norton fall that distance would render him unable to act.[30]\n\nThe score for the film was composed by Craig Armstrong, who was the arranger for Massive Attack, a band Leterrier was fond of and had collaborated with on the 2005 film Unleashed. Armstrong was his first choice, which surprised Marvel, not knowing if he had scored an action film (he did compose 2001's Kiss of the Dragon).[84] At Leterrier's suggestion, the soundtrack was released on a two-disc album, which Armstrong thought was a joke until he compiled the album and Marvel asked him why they were given only one disc.[85] The film's score borrows Joe Harnell's theme \"The Lonely Man\" from the 1978 Incredible Hulk television series.[86]\n\n\"We know the Hulk from 2003 didn't satisfy the fans, and we had to acknowledge that. We emphasized the passion that fans still have for this character and that this is the movie people have always wanted.\"\n\nEffort was made to promote the story as having a romance and a physical antagonist, and the title was used for promotional puns (such as 7-Eleven's \"Incredible Gulp\" Slurpees, and \"Incredible Dad\" themed Father's Day gifts at Kmart). Burger King also promoted the film, and General Nutrition Centers used the title character as a role model for strength training.[87] Hasbro created the toy line, which they released on May 3, 2008.[88] Sega released two tie-in video games on June 5, 2008; a version for consoles and personal computers was developed by Edge of Reality, while a handheld version for the Nintendo DS was developed by Amaze Entertainment.[89][90] The film was promoted in an episode of American Gladiators on June 9, 2008, which was hosted by Hulk Hogan and featured Lou Ferrigno.[91]\n\nFollowing the editing dispute between Norton and Leterrier, Universal's Adam Fogleson and Norton planned a promotional tour that would avoid constant media interviews and therefore uncomfortable questions. Norton attended the premiere, took part in a Jimmy Kimmel Live! sketch, and would also promote the film in Japan.[53] However, during the film's release he chose to do charity work in Africa.[92]\n\nThe Incredible Hulk premiered on June 8, 2008, at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Universal City, California[93] and was released in theaters on June 13 in the United States,[55] where it opened in 3,505 theaters.[94] The film is part of Phase One of the MCU.[95] The Incredible Hulk was formatted and screened in IMAX for the first time on August 30, 2018, as part of Marvel Studios' 10 year anniversary IMAX festival.[96]\n\nThe Incredible Hulk was released by Universal Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray and DVD on October 21, 2008. It includes behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and an alternate opening.[97][98]\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One – Avengers Assembled\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[99] It was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on April 2, 2013.[100] Universal released the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on April 10, 2018.[101] The Incredible Hulk began streaming on Disney+ in the United States on June 16, 2023, after the distribution rights to the film reverted to Marvel Studios and Disney from Universal.[4][5]\n\nThe Incredible Hulk earned $134.8 million in the United States and Canada, as well as $128.6 million from other territories, for a worldwide total of $263.4 million.[3] The film, even though it barely passed its predecessor, and only equaled it if the smaller budget of the first film is taken into account, was still considered moderately successful. Entertainment analyst David Davis told The Hollywood Reporter, \"The first Hulk had such high expectations after the NBCUniversal merger and was supposed to be critical-favorite Ang Lee's breakout commercial blockbuster. Then with the new Hulk film, Marvel was able to underplay the importance of the success after the great success of Iron Man this summer. So the new one overdelivered, relative to its underpromise.\"[102]\n\nThe Incredible Hulk earned $55.4 million in its opening weekend, becoming the top film at the box office.[94] Behind Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, it was the second-highest gross for a film released over the Father's Day weekend.[103] This surpassed industry expectations of a $45 million opening, following the disappointing response to the 2003 film. Universal believed word of mouth would contribute to the film breaking even eventually.[104]\n\nThe Incredible Hulk also opened in 38 other countries, adding $31 million to the total opening. The film outgrossed the 2003 film in South Korea, while its openings in Mexico and Russia created records for Universal.[105] The film grossed 24 million yuan (roughly $3.4 million) in its Chinese opening on August 26, outgrossing the previous film's overall gross of 10 million yuan.[106]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 68%, with an average score of 6.2/10, based on 237 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The Incredible Hulk may not be quite the smashing success that fans of Marvel's raging behemoth might hope for, but it offers more than enough big green action to make up for its occasionally puny narrative.\"[107] Metacritic gave the film an average score of 61 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[108] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[109]\n\nTodd McCarthy of Variety said, \"what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary revival of a big screen superhero emerges as perfectly solid summer action fare in The Incredible Hulk.\" He emphasized \"it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and with a hint of enthusiasm,\" and \"penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three—actually six—hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements.\"[110] Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald applauded that the film \"does a lot of things [Ang] Lee's Hulk didn't: it's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity\".[111] Mark Rahner of The Seattle Times wrote that, \"The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 Hulk in nearly every way – except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks\".[112] Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film stating, \"The Incredible Hulk is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's Hulk too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences.\"[113]\n\nConversely, Christy Lemire of the Associated Press found that \"the inevitable comparisons to Iron Man, Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's inner conflict\".[114] A.O. Scott of The New York Times opined, \"'The Adequate Hulk' would have been a more suitable title. There are some big, thumping fights and a few bright shards of pop-cultural wit, but for the most part this movie seems content to aim for the generic mean\".[115] David Ansen of Newsweek wrote, \"Leterrier has style, he's good with action and he's eager to give the audience its money's worth of bone-crunching battles. Still, once the movie leaves the atmospheric Brazilian settings, nothing in this \"Hulk\" sinks in deeply: its familiar genre pleasures are all on the surface. ... The movie's scene stealer is Tim Blake Nelson, making a comically welcome third act appearance as the unethical but madly enthusiastic scientist Samuel Sterns\".[116]\n\nMark Ruffalo (Leterrier's first choice before casting Norton)[10] replaced Norton as Banner / Hulk in the MCU beginning in The Avengers (2012),[123] after Feige said he chose not to bring back Norton. He explained: \"Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble\".[124] Norton felt this statement was \"cheap\".[19] In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.[125] Ruffalo also portrayed the character in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015),[126] Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).[127] Ruffalo said Banner was able to have a more prominent role in Ragnarok, Infinity War, and Endgame because of the lack of a standalone Hulk film, with the character's arc in those films \"feel[ing] like a Hulk movie\".[127] Ruffalo also made appearances in credits scenes of Iron Man 3 (2013),[128] Captain Marvel (2019),[129] and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021).[130]\n\nHurt first reprised his role as Thaddeus Ross in Captain America: Civil War (2016).[131] Ruffalo and Roth both reprised their roles in the Disney+ series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022).[132] Roth also provided uncredited vocals for Abomination in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.[133] Nelson and Tyler are set to reprise their respective roles as Samuel Sterns / Leader and Betty Ross in Captain America: Brave New World (2025),[134][135] while Harrison Ford was cast to play Thaddeus Ross in Brave New World and Thunderbolts* (2025) in the wake of Hurt's death in 2022.[136][137]\n\nIn March 2008, Norton said \"a lot\" was left out of the film because it had been envisioned as multiple parts, with this film \"intended as chapter one\".[16] Leterrier made the film's final shot of Banner ambiguous; the thought being if there was a sequel, it would mean Banner finally masters control over his anger; if there was not a sequel, the shot indicated instead that he becomes a menace in The Avengers.[138] Leterrier had also intended for a scene in the credits showing Blonsky, human once more, imprisoned and chained in a box,[139] with Feige originally having an idea that the character would be locked in a steel vault that would have been sunk to the bottom of the ocean.[140] The character of Samuel Sterns, played by Tim Blake Nelson, was introduced to set him up as a villain in a possible future film, where he would become the Leader.[24][141] Aaron Sims, the lead designer on The Incredible Hulk, also took time to work on concepts for the Leader.[142] Ty Burrell was also interested in portraying Doc Samson more faithfully to how he appears in the comics.[36]\n\nLeterrier and Roth were originally contracted to return. Leterrier also stated Norton was not signed on,[143] but in October, Hurd stated that Norton was contracted to reprise the role.[144] The film had outgrossed its predecessor and Universal indicated interest in a sequel,[145] though Leterrier believed a sequel would not be made because of the film's box office return.[146] Feige said the film met Marvel's expectations and that Hulk would return, but after The Avengers.[147] Hurd was not concerned that a sequel may not be produced until at least 2012, citing the positive reception to the film and having produced the Terminator series, the second and third film of which had a 12-year gap.[144] Leterrier, after having previously said he did not want to direct a sequel,[148] said in late 2009 he had changed his mind and was now amenable.[149]\n\nIn April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film.[150] In a Q&A session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions were underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in The Avengers.[151] In September, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the \"Planet Hulk\" and \"World War Hulk\" storylines, stated all stories from the comics were \"on the table\" and that the character could \"carry a movie and be as entertaining\" as he was in The Avengers. He added that Marvel Studios would not consider a sequel until after Age of Ultron.[152]\n\nIn June 2014, Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, \"I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did The Avengers it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be\".[153] In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a \"Planet Hulk\" film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in Phase Two of the MCU by saying the studio wanted to \"save\" one of the original Avengers characters for just the Avengers films, with the others appearing in their own solo films (Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America) or the films of other (Black Widow and Nick Fury in Captain America: The Winter Soldier).[154] In October, again on a solo film, Feige said, \"We'll see. We'd love to do it, we'd love to find the place to put it\", but that the character would make appearances in other character's films in Phase Three.[155] In August 2022, Ruffalo noted there had been conversations around exploring the two-year time period of Hulk arriving on Sakaar, as well as how Banner and Hulk were able to integrate to become Smart Hulk. He was also open to adapting more of Planet Hulk or World War Hulk, which he said the fans were hoping to see.[156]\n\nIn April 2015, Ruffalo said Universal holding the distribution rights to Hulk films may be an obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film,[157] and later reiterated this in October,[158] and July 2017.[159] Marvel regained the film production rights for the character in February 2006,[160] but Universal retained the distribution rights for The Incredible Hulk as well as the right of first refusal to pick up the distribution rights to each of any future Marvel-produced Hulk films.[161] According to The Hollywood Reporter, a potential reason why Marvel had not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with Paramount Pictures for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is that Universal holds the theme park rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company, Disney, wants for its own theme parks.[162] In December, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.[163] MCU director James Gunn expressed interest in doing a film featuring both Hulk and Red Hulk, but the project never entered development due to conflicts with Universal;[164] Red Hulk first appears in the MCU in Brave New World.[165]\n\nBy August 2022, reports believed it was possible Marvel Studios would regain the distribution rights to the character from Universal in 2023.[166][167] This was due to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings from Marvel Entertainment that indicated Universal had agreed to distribute The Incredible Hulk under the same terms Marvel agreed to with Paramount, which held distribution rights for 15 years from its first release.[168] In March 2023, Citigroup financial analyst Jason Bazinet felt Disney may try to include the distribution rights to Hulk, as well as Namor, in any potential sale of the streaming service Hulu to Comcast, the owner of Universal Pictures through NBCUniversal.[169] The distribution rights to The Incredible Hulk returned to Marvel Studios and Disney by June 15, 2023.[4][5] In August 2023, Leterrier revealed a potential sequel had considered featuring Hulk's Grey Hulk persona as well as multiple Red Hulks.[170] In February 2024, Ruffalo expressed doubt over the likelihood of making a standalone Hulk film, citing the cost of the CGI required for the character as a reason.[171]\n"

        "content": "This is an accepted version of this page\n\n\nIron Man 2 is a 2010 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Iron Man. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures,[a] it is the sequel to Iron Man (2008) and the third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Jon Favreau and written by Justin Theroux, the film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, and Samuel L. Jackson. Set six months after the events of Iron Man, the film follows Tony Stark as he resists calls from the United States government to hand over the Iron Man technology, which is causing his declining health. Meanwhile, Russian scientist Ivan Vanko (Rourke) uses his own version of the technology to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family.\n\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July, Theroux was hired to write the script and Favreau was signed to return as director. Downey, Paltrow, and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from Iron Man, while Cheadle was brought in to replace Terrence Howard in the role of James Rhodes. In early 2009, Rourke (Vanko), Rockwell, and Johansson filled out the supporting cast. Filming took place from April to July 2009, mostly in California as in the first film, except for a key sequence in Monaco. Unlike its predecessor, which mixed digital and practical effects, the sequel primarily relied on computer-generated imagery to create the Iron Man suits.\n\nIron Man 2 premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on April 26, 2010, and was released in the United States on May 7, as part of Phase One of the MCU. It received praise for its action sequences and performances, although critics deemed it inferior to the first film. The film grossed over $623.9 million at the worldwide box office, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2010. It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. A sequel, Iron Man 3, was released on May 3, 2013.\n\nIn Russia, the media covers Tony Stark's disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. Ivan Vanko, mourning the death of his father Anton Vanko—a former Stark Industries employee, sees this and builds the same miniature arc reactor as Stark's using old Stark Industries blueprints left behind by Anton.\n\nSix months later,[b]  in an effort to continue the legacy of his father Howard, Tony re-institutes the Stark Expo in New York City's Flushing Meadows–Corona Park and resists pressure to turn over his armored suits to the government and Stark's rival, Justin Hammer. Stark learns that the palladium core in the arc reactor that keeps him alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he is unable to find a substitute. Growing increasingly despondent about his impending death, and refusing to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his assistant Pepper Potts as CEO of Stark Industries and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his assistant.\n\nStark competes in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix, where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips powered by his arc reactor. Stark dons his armor and defeats Vanko, but the armor is severely damaged. Vanko explains that he intended to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Hammer fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. Vanko decides that unmanned drones are better to eliminate the human factor.\n\nDuring his birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Iron Man suit. Annoyed by Tony's recklessness, Stark's best friend, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, dons Stark's prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, and Rhodes confiscates the prototype armor for the U.S. Air Force. Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., approaches Stark. Fury reveals that \"Rushman\" is S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Natasha Romanoff and that Fury personally knew Howard Stark, who was a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury explains that Vanko's father and Howard invented the arc reactor together, but Howard had Anton deported when the latter tried to sell it. The Soviets then sent Anton to the Gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material. In a diorama of the 1974 Stark Expo, Stark finds a diagram of the atomic structure of a new element. With the aid of his A.I., J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark determines it can replace his arc reactor's current palladium core, and successfully synthesizes it.\n\nWhen Stark learns that Vanko is still alive, he goes to Hammer's expo. As Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, they are led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the prototype armor, dubbed \"War Machine\". Just as Stark arrives to warn Rhodes, Vanko takes remote control of all the drones and Rhodes's armor and attacks Stark. Hammer is arrested for breaking Vanko out of prison while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard Happy Hogan infiltrate Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff gains access to Hammer Industries software and returns control of Rhodes's armor to him. Together, Stark and Rhodes defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko dies by suicide by blowing up his suit and the drones.\n\nAt a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of his difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant moving forward. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism. In a post-credits scene, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson discovers a large hammer in a desert in New Mexico.[c]\n\nThe director, Jon Favreau, reprises his role as Happy Hogan,[37] Tony Stark's bodyguard and chauffeur, while Clark Gregg and Leslie Bibb reprise their roles as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson[38] and reporter Christine Everhart,[39] respectively. John Slattery appears as Tony's father Howard Stark[40] and Garry Shandling appears as United States Senator Stern, who wants Stark to give Iron Man's armor to the government.[41] Favreau stated that Shandling's character was named after radio personality Howard Stern.[42] Paul Bettany again voices Stark's computer, J.A.R.V.I.S.[43] Olivia Munn originally appeared as an unnamed character who was subsequently cut from the film. Favreau then gave her the role of Chess Roberts, a reporter covering the Stark expo.[44][45] Yevgeni Lazarev appears as Ivan Vanko's father, Anton Vanko,[46] Kate Mara portrays a process server who summons Tony to the government hearing,[47] and Stan Lee appears as himself (but is mistaken for Larry King).[48]\n\nAdditionally, news anchor Christiane Amanpour,[49] political commentator Bill O'Reilly,[50] Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, and Oracle Corporation CEO Larry Ellison appear as themselves.[51] Adam Goldstein, who also appears as himself, died before the film's release; the film is dedicated to his memory.[52] Favreau's son Max appears as a child wearing an Iron Man mask whom Stark saves from a drone. In 2017, Spider-Man: Homecoming director Jon Watts said that he had suggested to Feige that they retroactively establish this child to be the introduction of a young Peter Parker / Spider-Man to the MCU, an idea that Feige agreed was plausible,[53] and which then-Spider-Man actor Tom Holland also supported.[54]\n\nJon Favreau said it was originally his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man,[55] with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) becoming Iron Monger during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including Mark Millar, Stane became the main villain in Iron Man. Millar argued that the Mandarin, whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical.[56] Favreau concurred, deciding, \"I look at Mandarin more like how in Star Wars you had the Emperor, but Darth Vader is the guy you want to see fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in Return of the Jedi happen in A New Hope. You just can't do it.\"[57] Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin \"allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains\". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.[58]\n\nDuring development, Favreau said the film would explore Stark's alcoholism, but it would not be \"the 'Demon in a Bottle' version\".[58] While promoting the first film, Downey stated that Stark would probably develop a drinking problem as he is unable to cope with his age, the effects of revealing he is Iron Man, and Pepper getting a boyfriend.[59] Downey later clarified that the film was not a strict adaptation of the \"Demon in a Bottle\" storyline from the comic book series, but was instead about the \"interim space\" between the origin and the \"Demon\" story arc.[60] The storyline was ultimately downplayed for the film, as studio executives were concerned with how an alcoholic Iron Man would be perceived in marketing and affect merchandise sales.[61] Shane Black gave some advice on the script, and suggested to Favreau and Downey that they model Stark on J. Robert Oppenheimer, who became depressed with being \"the destroyer of worlds\" after working on the Manhattan Project.[59] An early version for the film's story involved Justin Hammer creating different villains in addition to Whiplash, like Ghost, but the idea was discarded. Ghost debuted in the MCU years later in Ant-Man and the Wasp.[62]\n\nImmediately following Iron Man's release, Marvel Studios announced that they were developing a sequel, with an intended release date of April 30, 2010.[63] In July 2008, after several months of negotiating, Favreau officially signed on to direct.[64] That same month, Justin Theroux signed to write the script, which would be based on a story written by Favreau and Downey.[65] Theroux co-wrote Tropic Thunder, which Downey had starred in, and Downey recommended him to Marvel.[66] Genndy Tartakovsky storyboarded the film,[67] and Adi Granov returned to supervise the designs for Iron Man's armor.[58]\n\nIn October 2008, Marvel Studios came to an agreement to film Iron Man 2, as well as their next three films, at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach, California.[68] A few days later, Don Cheadle was hired to replace Terrence Howard.[14] On being replaced, Howard stated, \"There was no explanation, apparently the contracts that we write and sign aren't worth the paper that they're printed on sometimes. Promises aren't kept, and good-faith negotiations aren't always held up.\"[69] Entertainment Weekly stated Favreau did not enjoy working with Howard, often re-shooting and cutting his scenes; Howard's publicist said he had a good experience playing the part, while Marvel chose not to comment. As Favreau and Theroux chose to reduce the role, Marvel came to Howard to discuss lowering his salary—Howard was the first actor hired in Iron Man and was paid the largest salary. The publication stated they were unsure whether Howard's representatives left the project first or if Marvel chose to stop negotiating.[70] Theroux denied the part of the report which claimed the size of the role had fluctuated.[66] In November 2013, Howard stated that, going into the film, the studio offered him far less than was in his three-picture contract, claiming they told him the second will be successful, \"with or without you,\" and, without mentioning him by name, said Downey \"took the money that was supposed to go to me and pushed me out.\"[71]\n\nIn January 2009, Rourke and Rockwell entered negotiations to play a pair of villains.[72] A few days later, Rockwell confirmed he would take the role, and that his character would be Justin Hammer.[24] Paul Bettany confirmed that he would be returning to voice J.A.R.V.I.S.[43] Marvel entered into early talks with Emily Blunt to play the Black Widow,[73] though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in Gulliver's Travels.[74] Samuel L. Jackson confirmed that he had been in discussions to reprise the role of Nick Fury from the first film's post-credits scene, but that contract disputes were making a deal difficult. Jackson stated, \"There was a huge kind of negotiation that broke down. I don't know. Maybe I won't be Nick Fury.\"[75]\n\nIn February, Jackson and Marvel came to terms, and he was signed to play the character in up to nine films.[35] Downey and Rourke discussed his part during a roundtable discussion with David Ansen at the 2009 Golden Globes, and Rourke met with Favreau and Theroux to discuss the role. Rourke almost dropped out because of Marvel's initial salary offer of $250,000, but the studio raised the offer, and in March, Rourke signed on.[76] Later that same day, Scarlett Johansson signed on to play the Black Widow. Her deal included options for multiple films, including potentially The Avengers.[77] Prior to her casting, Johansson had also researched other Marvel characters she could play, including the Blonde Phantom and the Wasp.[62] In April, Garry Shandling,[41] Clark Gregg, and Kate Mara joined the cast.[38]\n\n\"This is one of the richest men in the world, so we can't buy our practicals from Home Depot. Everything had to be intelligent technology, and it had to look classic enough to have some shelf life – we didn't want it to look embarrassingly dated 10 years from now.\"\n\nPrincipal photography began April 6, 2009,[79] at the Pasadena Masonic Temple,[80] with the working title Rasputin.[81] The bulk of the production took place at Raleigh Studios,[78] though other locations were also used. Scenes were filmed at Edwards Air Force Base from May 11 through May 13. The location had also been used for Iron Man, and Favreau stated that he felt the \"real military assets make the movie more authentic and the topography and the beauty of the desert and flightline open the movie up\".[82] The Historic Grand Prix of Monaco action sequence was shot in the parking lot of Downey Studios, with sets constructed in May[83] and filming lasting through June.[84] Permission to film in Monaco prior to the 2009 Monaco Grand Prix had initially been awarded, but was later retracted by Bernie Ecclestone. The filmmakers shipped one Rolls-Royce Phantom there and filmed a track sequence in which race cars were later digitally added. Tanner Foust took on the role of driving Stark's racing car.[85] Also in June, it was reported that John Slattery had joined the film's cast as Howard Stark.[40] Olivia Munn was also cast, in an unspecified role.[86]\n\nA massive green screen was constructed at the Sepulveda Dam to film a portion of the Stark Expo exterior, with the rest either shot at an area high school or added digitally. To construct the green screen, hundreds of shipping containers were stacked, covered in plywood and plaster, and then painted green.[78] For the conclusion of that climactic scene, which the crew dubbed the \"Japanese Garden\" scene, a set was built inside Sony Studios in Los Angeles.[78] Filming lasted 71 days, and the film's production officially wrapped on July 18, 2009.[79] A post-credits scene depicting the discovery of a large hammer was filmed on the set of Thor, and some of it was reused in the film.[52] Jon Favreau revealed that the scene was filmed with anamorphic lenses to match Thor,[52] and was directed by Kenneth Branagh, the director of Thor.[87]\n\nA large amount of improvisation was done on set during filming, notably from Downey, which necessitated Theroux to do \"writing gymnastics\" to create a cohesive narrative around the various ad-libs; this process caused Theroux's back to give out and become bedridden because of the stress and toll it took on him. The film's story eventually strayed from the intended adaptation of the \"Demon in the Bottle\" storyline.[61] Speaking to the \"Demon in the Bottle\" elements in the film, Theroux noted how Stark is shown drinking and out of control, becoming a \"self-destructive ticking clock\", stating that his palladium illness served as a substitute metaphor for \"a man who's running out of steam and needs his friends to step up\". Additionally, the creatives did not want the film to become like Leaving Las Vegas (1995) had they faithfully adapted the storyline.[88]\n\nIn January 2010, IMAX Corporation, Marvel, and Paramount announced that the film would receive a limited release on digital IMAX screens.[89] It was not shot with IMAX cameras, so it was converted into the format using the IMAX DMR technology.[67][89] The film underwent reshoots in February.[90] Olivia Munn's original role was cut, but she was given a new role during the reshoots.[45]\n\nJanek Sirrs was the film's visual effects supervisor,[91] and Industrial Light & Magic did the majority of the effects, as it did on the first film.[92] ILM's visual effects supervisor on the film, Ben Snow, said their work on the film was \"harder\" than their work on the first, stating that Favreau asked more of them this time around. Snow described the process of digitally creating the suits:\n\nOn the first Iron Man, we tried to use the Legacy [Studios, Stan Winston's effects company] and Stan Winston suits as much as we could. For the second one, Jon [Favreau] was confident we could create the CG suits, and the action dictated using them. So, Legacy created what we called the \"football suits\" from the torso up with a chest plate and helmet. We'd usually put in some arm pieces, but not the whole arm. In the house fight sequence, where Robert Downey Jr. staggers around tipsy, we used some of the practical suit and extended it digitally. Same thing in the Randy's Donuts scene. But in the rest of the film, we used the CG suit entirely. And Double Negative did an all-digital suit for the Monaco chase.[92]\nILM created 527 shots for the film, using programs such as Maya.[93] Perception worked on over 125 shots for the film.[94] They crafted gadgets, such as Tony Stark's transparent LG smartphone,[95] and created the backdrops for the Stark Expo as well as the computer screen interfaces on the touch-screen coffee table and the holographic lab environment.[94] In total, 11 visual effect studios worked on the film.[91]\n\nA soundtrack album featuring AC/DC was released by Columbia Records on April 19, 2010,[96] in at least three different versions: basic, special and deluxe. The basic edition includes the CD; the special edition contains a 15-track CD, a 32-page booklet and a DVD featuring interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and music videos; and the deluxe includes a reproduction of one of Iron Man's first comic book appearances. Only 2 songs on the soundtrack actually appear in the movie. Although not included on the soundtrack album the film includes songs by The Average White Band, The Clash, Queen, Daft Punk, 2Pac and Beastie Boys.[97]\n\nThe film score was released commercially as Iron Man 2: Original Motion Picture Score on July 20, 2010, featuring 25 tracks. John Debney composed the score with Tom Morello, with composer Richard M. Sherman of the Sherman Brothers contributing the Stark Expo theme song, \"Make Way for Tomorrow Today\".[98]\n\nAt the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, a five-minute trailer for the movie was shown. Actors portraying Stark Industries recruiters handed out business cards with an invitation to apply.[99] A website for Stark Industries went online, with an attached graphic of a \"napkin memo\" from Stark to Potts announcing that Stark Industries no longer made weapons. Another section featured an online application.[100] It was confirmed that the first theatrical trailer would premiere in front of Sherlock Holmes (another Robert Downey Jr. film). This trailer was released online on December 16, 2009. A new trailer was shown by Robert Downey Jr. on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on March 7 after the Academy Awards.[101] Promotional partners included Symantec, Dr Pepper, Burger King, 7 Eleven, Audi, LG Electronics[102] and Hershey.[103]\n\nAuthor Alexander C. Irvine adapted the script into a novel, also titled Iron Man 2, that was released in April 2010.[104] Prior to the film release, Marvel Comics released a four-issue miniseries comic book titled Iron Man vs Whiplash, which introduced the film's version of Whiplash into the Marvel Universe.[105] A three-issue prequel miniseries titled Iron Man 2: Public Identity was released in April.[106][107][108]\n\nAn Iron Man 2 video game was released by Sega on May 4, 2010, in North America,[109] written by The Invincible Iron Man scribe Matt Fraction.[110] The Wii version was developed by High Voltage Software and all console versions were published by Sega,[111] while Gameloft published the mobile game.[112] The game's Comic-Con trailer showed that the Crimson Dynamo was set to appear as a villain. Cheadle and Jackson voice their respective characters in the games.[113] The trailer revealed that A.I.M, Roxxon Energy Corporation, and Ultimo (depicted as a man named Kearson DeWitt in a large armor suit) are enemies in the game as well as revealing that the wearer of the Crimson Dynamo armor is General Valentin Shatalov.[114] The game received \"generally unfavorable\" reviews, with a Metacritic score of 41% for both the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions.[115][116]\n\nIron Man 2 premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, California, on April 26, 2010,[117] and was released in 6,764 theaters (48 IMAX) across 54 countries between April 28 and May 7,[3][118][119] before going into general release in the United States on May 7, 2010.[118] In the United States, it opened at 4,380 theaters, 181 of which were IMAX.[120] The international release date of the film was moved forward to increase interest ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup association football tournament.[121] Iron Man 2 is part of Phase One of the MCU.[122]\n\nOn September 28, 2010, the film was released by Paramount Home Entertainment on DVD and Blu-ray.[123] The film was also collected in a 10-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One – Avengers Assembled\", which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[124] It was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on April 2, 2013.[125][126]\n\nIron Man 2 earned $312.4 million in the United States and Canada, as well as $311.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $623.9 million.[3] Since the film was included in a predetermined legacy distribution deal that was signed before The Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel, Paramount Pictures distributed the film and collected 8% of the box office, while the remaining portion went to Disney.[2][127]\n\nIron Man 2 earned $51 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada (including $7.5 million from Thursday previews),[128] for a total weekend gross of $128 million, which was the fifth-highest opening weekend ever, at the time, behind The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 3, The Twilight Saga: New Moon, and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. It also had the highest opening for a 2010 movie and Paramount's highest opening weekend.[120] The film yielded an average of $29,252 per theater.[128] IMAX contributed $9.8 million, which was the highest opening weekend for a 2D IMAX film, surpassing Star Trek's previous record of $8.5 million.[120] Iron Man 2 is the third-highest-grossing film of 2010 in the United States and Canada, behind Toy Story 3 and Alice in Wonderland.[129]\n\nIron Man 2 launched in six European markets with number-one openings on Wednesday, April 28, 2010, for a total of $2.2 million.[130] It earned $100.2 million its first five days from 53 foreign markets, for a strong average of $14,814 per site.[3] IMAX Corporation reported grosses of $2.25 million, surpassing the previous record-holder for an IMAX 2D release, 2009's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen ($2.1 million).[119] It was the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2010 internationally, behind Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1, Inception, Shrek Forever After, and The Twilight Saga: Eclipse.[131]\n\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 72%, with an average score of 6.5/10, based on 305 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"It isn't quite the breath of fresh air that Iron Man was, but this sequel comes close with solid performances and an action-packed plot.\"[132] Metacritic gave the film a weighted average rating of 57 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[133] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on a scale of A+ to F, the same score as its predecessor.[128]\n\nBrian Lowry of Variety stated, \"Iron Man 2 isn't as much fun as its predecessor, but by the time the smoke clears, it'll do\".[50] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said, \"To find a comic-book hero who doesn't agonize over his supergifts, and would defend his constitutional right to get a kick out of them, is frankly a relief\".[134] David Edelstein of New York Magazine wrote, \"It doesn't come close to the emotional heft of those two rare 2s that outclassed their ones: Superman II and Spider-Man 2. But Iron Man 2 hums along quite nicely\".[135] Roger Ebert gave it 3 stars out of 4, stating, \"Iron Man 2 is a polished, high-octane sequel, not as good as the original but building once again on a quirky performance by Robert Downey Jr\".[136] Frank Lovece of Film Journal International, a one-time Marvel Comics writer, said, \"In a refreshing and unexpected turn, the sequel to Iron Man doesn't find a changed man. Inside the metal, imperfect humanity grows even more so, as thought-provoking questions of identity meet techno-fantasy made flesh.\"[137]\n\nConversely, Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter stated, \"Everything fun and terrific about Iron Man, a mere two years ago, has vanished with its sequel. In its place, Iron Man 2 has substituted noise, confusion, multiple villains, irrelevant stunts and misguided story lines.\"[138]\n\nAfter the release of Iron Man 2, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115 million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3 and The Avengers.[148] Iron Man 3 was released on May 3, 2013.[149] Shane Black directed the film,[150] from a screenplay by Drew Pearce.[151] Downey, Paltrow, Cheadle, and Favreau reprised their roles, while Ben Kingsley[152] played Trevor Slattery,[153] Guy Pearce played Aldrich Killian,[154] and Rebecca Hall[155] played Maya Hansen.[156]\n"

        "content": "This is an accepted version of this page\n\n\nThor is a 2011 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures,[a] it is the fourth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It was directed by Kenneth Branagh, written by the writing team of Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz along with Don Payne, and stars Chris Hemsworth as the title character alongside Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgård, Kat Dennings, Clark Gregg, Colm Feore, Ray Stevenson, Idris Elba, Jaimie Alexander, Rene Russo, and Anthony Hopkins. After reigniting a dormant war, Thor is banished from Asgard to Earth, stripped of his powers and his hammer Mjölnir. As his brother Loki (Hiddleston) plots to take the Asgardian throne, Thor must prove himself worthy.\n\nSam Raimi first developed the concept of a film adaptation based on Thor in 1991, but soon abandoned the project, leaving it in \"development hell\" for several years. During this time, the rights were picked up by various film studios until Marvel signed Mark Protosevich to develop the project in 2006, and planned to finance and release it through Paramount. Matthew Vaughn was assigned to direct the film for a tentative 2010 release. However, after Vaughn was released from his holding deal in 2008, Branagh was approached and the film's release was rescheduled to 2011. The main characters were cast in 2009, and principal photography took place in California and New Mexico from January to May 2010. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.\n\nThor premiered in Sydney on April 17, 2011, and was released in the United States on May 6, as part of Phase One of the MCU. It received generally positive reviews from critics and was a financial success, earning $449.3 million worldwide. Three sequels have been released: Thor: The Dark World (2013), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), and Thor: Love and Thunder (2022).\n\nIn 965 AD, Odin, king of Asgard, wages war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim and their leader Laufey, to prevent them from conquering the Nine Realms, starting with Earth. The Asgardians defeat the Frost Giants and seize the source of their power, the Casket of Ancient Winters.\n\nIn the present,[b] Odin's son Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard but is interrupted when Frost Giants, secretly allowed in by his brother Loki, attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by Loki, childhood friend Sif and the Warriors Three: Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. As punishment for Thor's arrogance, Odin deems his son unworthy, strips him of his powers and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer Mjölnir, now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.\n\nThor lands in New Mexico, where astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster, her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. Erik Selvig find him. The local populace discovers Mjölnir, which S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Foster's data about the wormhole that delivered Thor to Earth. Having learned about  Mjölnir's nearby location, Thor seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. has constructed and tries to lift it, but is unable to do so and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Foster.\n\nLoki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. Loki confronts Odin, who wearily falls into the deep \"Odinsleep\" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing Heimdall, gatekeeper of the Bifröst—the means of traveling between worlds—to allow them passage to Earth. Aware and suspicious of their plan, Loki sends the Destroyer, a seemingly indestructible automaton, to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and overpowers them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor proves himself worthy to wield Mjölnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Thor and Jane kiss each other goodbye before he leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront Loki.\n\nIn Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey. Thor arrives, and Loki reveals his plan to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifröst Bridge. Thor fights Loki before destroying the Bifröst Bridge to stop Loki's plan. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge’s destruction; when Odin rejects Loki's pleas for approval, Loki allows himself to fall into the abyss. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king and longs to see Jane. Meanwhile, on Earth, Foster and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Selvig is taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where Nick Fury opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube-shaped object,[c] which Fury says may hold untold power. An invisible Loki, who survived his fall and arrived on Earth, secretly prompts Selvig to agree.\n\nAdditionally, Tadanobu Asano portrays Hogun, a member of the Warriors Three primarily identified by his grim demeanor and as the only member who is not an Æsir.[32] Ray Stevenson said of Asano's character, \"He doesn't speak much but when he does, everybody shuts up. But also in the healing room where everyone licks their wounds, he's the guy who just goes about his business\".[51] Josh Dallas portrays Fandral, an irrepressible swashbuckler and romantic member of the Warriors Three.[32] Stuart Townsend was initially cast after Zachary Levi was forced to vacate the role due to a scheduling conflict.[32][52] However, days before filming began, Townsend was replaced by Dallas citing \"creative differences\".[53] Dallas said he believed that Fandral \"would like to think of himself a philanderer. He would like to think of himself, I was saying, as the R. Kelly of Asgard. He's a lover, not a fighter\". Dallas mentioned that Errol Flynn was an inspiration for the character stating, \"He was a big inspiration for the character and for me. I watched a lot of his movies and kind of got that into my bones. I tried to bring out that little bit of Flynn-ness in it. Flynn had a lot of that boyish charm that Fandral's got....\"[51]\n\nMaximiliano Hernández appears as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jasper Sitwell, Adriana Barraza plays diner owner Isabella Alvarez and Isaac Kappy plays a pet store clerk.[54] Joseph Gatt, Josh Coxx, and Douglas Tait portray Frost Giants.[55][56] Stan Lee and J. Michael Straczynski have cameo appearances as pick-up truck drivers,[57][58] Walter Simonson has a cameo appearance as one of the guests at a large Asgardian banquet,[59] and Samuel L. Jackson and Jeremy Renner have uncredited cameos as Nick Fury and Clint Barton / Hawkeye, respectively.[60][61]\n\n\"Thor's powers are godly, yes ... But at the end of the day, he's a man ... Odin sends him to Earth because he's not perfect. He's brash, arrogant. Even over-confident ... he also bleeds. He struggles. Life kicks him where it hurts the most ... You want to feel Thor's rage when he rages. You want to see him fight like hell, and take as much as he dishes out -- maybe more. You want to have a visceral reaction to the guy, and what happens to him. You don't want his adventures to be clean and antiseptic. You want to see the dirt, and grime and blood. You want to feel every bone crunching moment of every fight. And when he unleashes the storm, you want to feel like you're seeing the power of a GOD at work.\"\n\nSam Raimi originally envisioned the idea for Thor after making Darkman (1990); he met Thor co-creator Stan Lee and pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, but they did not understand it.[63] Thor was abandoned until April 1997, when Marvel Studios was beginning to expand rapidly.[64] The film gained momentum after the success of X-Men (2000). The plan was for Thor to be made for television. UPN was in talks for airing it; excited by the prospect, they pushed for a script and approached Tyler Mane to play Thor.[65] In May 2000, Marvel Studios brought Artisan Entertainment to help finance it as a film, but by June 2004 the project still had yet to be patronized by a studio.[66][67][68] Sony Pictures Entertainment finally purchased the film rights, and in December 2004 David S. Goyer was in negotiations to write and direct.[69] By 2005, though there were talks between Goyer and Marvel, Goyer was no longer interested, though at this point the film was still set to be distributed through Sony Pictures.[70]\n\nMark Protosevich, a fan of the Thor comic book, agreed to write the script in April 2006, and the project moved to Paramount Pictures, after it acquired the rights from Sony.[71] That year the film was announced to be a Marvel Studios production.[72] In December 2007, Protosevich described his plans for it \"to be like a superhero origin story, but not one about a human gaining super powers, but of a god realizing his true potential. It's the story of an Old Testament god who becomes a New Testament god\".[73] Protosevich's script saw Odin banishing Thor to Earth in the Middle Ages, where he becomes enslaved by Norsemen before being rescued by Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.[74]: 148  In August 2007, Marvel Studios signed Matthew Vaughn to direct the film.[75] Vaughn then rewrote Protosevich's script in order to bring down the budget to $150 million, as Protosevich's first draft would have cost $300 million to produce.[76] After the success of Iron Man, Marvel Studios announced that they intended to release Thor on June 4, 2010, with Iron Man 2 being used to introduce the character of Thor.[77]\n\n\"Thor, at his best, has always had a classic bent in terms of his history, the way he speaks and the often Shakespearean dramas that surround him. That kind of dialogue and character needs someone who comes from a classically trained background in order for it not to sound forced or artificial. Branagh is the perfect choice.\"\n\nVaughn was released when his holding deal expired in May 2008, at which point Marvel set Protosevich to work on a new draft and began searching for a new director.[79] Marvel Studios also approached J. Michael Straczynski to work on an outline.[74]: 148  Guillermo del Toro entered talks to direct the film. Del Toro was a fan of Jack Kirby's work on the comics, and said that he loved the character of Loki, but wished to incorporate more of the original Norse mythology into the film,[80] including a \"really dingy Valhalla, [with] Vikings and mud\".[81] However, del Toro ultimately turned down Thor to direct The Hobbit. By September 2008, D. J. Caruso had been discussing taking on the project, though he did not read the script.[82] Later that month, Kenneth Branagh entered into negotiations to direct,[83] while Daniel Craig was offered the leading role, but ultimately turned it down, citing his commitments to the James Bond franchise.[84]\n\nBy December 2008, Branagh confirmed that he had been hired. He described it as \"a human story right in the center of a big epic scenario\".[85] In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson, who had briefly portrayed Nick Fury at the end of the film Iron Man, signed on to reprise the role in Thor as part of an unprecedented nine-picture deal with Marvel Studios.[60] In the same month, a casting call went out looking for actors with certain physical attributes to audition for the role of Thor.[86] Marvel Studios set back the release date of the film in March 2009 from its scheduled July 16, 2010 date to June 17, 2011.[87] They later moved the release date to May 20, 2011, to distance the film's release from that of Captain America: The First Avenger, another Marvel Studios film that was scheduled to be released on July 22, 2011.[88] Marvel Studios then approached television writing team Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz to work on the script; they were chosen because Marvel was looking to get the script done quickly, understanding that television writers were usually able to get work done fast.[12]\n\nIn May 2009, Chris Hemsworth was in negotiations to portray the title role after a back-and-forth process in which the 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given a second chance to read for the part. Hemsworth's brother, Liam also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige.[10] Josh Hartnett, Kevin McKidd, and Triple H were also considered for the role, while Charlie Hunnam, Alexander Skarsgård, and Joel Kinnaman were tested.[89][10][12] Alan Ritchson auditioned, but lost the part after he failed to take the casting process seriously.[90] The next day, Marvel announced that Tom Hiddleston, who had worked with Branagh before and had initially been considered to portray the lead role, had been cast as Loki.[19] Branagh stated that he hoped to begin filming in January 2010.[91] In June 2009, Feige confirmed that both Hemsworth and Hiddleston had signed on.[92] Feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor's human host, Dr. Donald Blake, would not be included.[92]\n\nIn July 2009, Marvel announced that Natalie Portman would portray Jane Foster.[15] Branaugh was drawn to the intelligence Portman brought to the role, while Stenz felt that \"pretty much every notable Hollywood actress between the ages of twenty-five and thirty\" were seen for the part.[12] Jaimie Alexander and Colm Feore were reported to have joined the cast in September, with Alexander portraying Sif and Feore's role unrevealed, though it was thought to be a villain.[41] In an interview with Swedish news site Ystads Allehanda, Stellan Skarsgård stated that he had joined the cast, though he did not specify his role.[22] By late October Anthony Hopkins had been cast as Odin in the film.[47] The following month, Marvel announced that they had cast the Warriors Three; Fandral was to be played by Stuart Townsend, Hogun was to be played by Tadanobu Asano and Volstagg was to be played by Ray Stevenson.[32] Idris Elba was announced to have joined the cast, portraying Heimdall.[34] Natalie Portman revealed that Kat Dennings would be involved in the project, portraying Darcy, a coworker of Portman's Jane Foster.[25][93] Feige was inspired by The Godfather (1972) since like Thor, that film is about \"fathers and sons, and it’s about the actions that a father takes that his sons will have to answer for\".[12]\n\nIn December 2009, Rene Russo was cast as Frigga, Thor's mother and Odin's wife.[45] Later that month, actors Joseph Gatt, Troy Brenna, and Josh Coxx had been cast in the film, though none of their roles were revealed.[55] In January 2010, Adriana Barraza had joined the film's cast, in a supporting capacity.[94] Only days before filming began, Stuart Townsend was replaced by Joshua Dallas as Fandral, citing \"creative differences\".[53] When Spider-Man 4's production stalled, Paramount and Marvel Entertainment pushed up the release of Thor by two weeks to May 6, 2011.[95]\n\nThe Science & Entertainment Exchange introduced Marvel Entertainment, Kenneth Branagh, \"the screenwriter, and a few people on the design and production side of things\" to three physicists (Sean Carroll, Kevin Hand, and Jim Hartle), as well as physics student Kevin Hickerson, to provide a realistic science background for the Thor universe. The consultation resulted in a change in Jane Foster's profession, from nurse to particle physicist, and the terminology (Einstein-Rosen bridge) to describe the Bifrost Bridge.[96]\n\nIn October 2008, Marvel Studios signed a long-term lease agreement with Raleigh Studios to photograph their next four films—Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers—at Raleigh's Manhattan Beach, California facility.[97] Production Weekly reported that filming on Marvel's Thor was scheduled to begin in Los Angeles mid-January, then move to Santa Fe, New Mexico from March until late-April.[98] Principal photography began on January 11, 2010.[99] A few days after filming began, Clark Gregg signed on to reprise his role from Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as Agent Coulson.[28] In February, Paramount Pictures entered negotiations with Del Mar, California to use a 300-yard stretch of beach to film a scene for Thor involving six horses running down the terrain. Paramount said this coastline was ideal because its gradual slope of sand down to the waterline creates excellent reflective opportunities on film.[100] On March 15, 2010, production of Thor moved to Galisteo, New Mexico where Cerro Pelon Ranch,[101] an old-fashioned Western film town, was extensively modified for the shoot.[102][103]\n\nBranagh, a fan of the comic book since childhood, commented on the challenge of bridging Asgard and the modern world: \"Inspired by the comic book world both pictorially and compositionally at once, we've tried to find a way to make a virtue and a celebration of the distinction between the worlds that exist in the film but absolutely make them live in the same world. It's about finding the framing style, the color palette, finding the texture and the amount of camera movement that helps celebrate and express the differences and the distinctions in those worlds. If it succeeds, it will mark this film as different.... The combination of the primitive and the sophisticated, the ancient and the modern, I think that potentially is the exciting fusion, the exciting tension in the film\".[104]\n\nBy April, the prospect for filming parts of Thor in Del Mar, California had fallen through. Paramount Pictures sent a letter informing the city that it has instead chosen an undisclosed Northern California location to film a beachfront scene for the film. The letter cited cost concerns with moving production too far away from its headquarters.[105] In April 2010, Jackson stated he would not be appearing in Thor, despite the claims he would with his nine-picture deal;[106] however, later in the month he said he would be filming a scene for Thor to serve as \"connective tissue\" for The Avengers.[107] During filming, Marvel Studios enlisted the help of the writers it had in its in-house writers program, including Christopher Yost and Nicole Perlman, for uncredited on-set rewrites. Perlman worked on enhancing Jane Foster's role in the film in addition to some material with Odin and Thor in the New Mexico town, while Yost, along with The Avengers writer and director Joss Whedon, wrote material for Jeremy Renner's cameo as Clint Barton / Hawkeye. Renner's cameo was filmed in a parking lot behind a grocery store.[74]: 173–174  Filming wrapped on May 6, 2010.[13]\n\nIn October 2010, casting calls revealed the film would be undergoing an undisclosed number of reshoots.[108] In March 2011, scenes involving Adriana Barraza were removed from the theatrical cut of the film during the editing process. Branagh sent a letter of apology explaining the reasons for the cut and desire to work with Barraza again in the future. In response Barraza stated, \"It saddens me because the movie is great and because I was acting alongside some tremendous actors that I admire very much, but I understand the nature of films, and it's not the first or last time that scenes will be cut\".[109] Barraza appears in only one scene in the film's theatrical cut. In that same month, Douglas Tait revealed that he performed for motion capture of the Frost Giants.[110] On his hiring, Tait said \"I am 6'5\" and have a lean, athletic build, and they hired guys who were 6'7\" and taller, and weighed over 250 pounds (110 kg). When the film was being edited, they wanted to make them even bigger and move faster. They auditioned people again and Kenneth Branagh chose me to perform the motion capture movements of the Frost Giants\".[110] In April 2011, the IMAX Corporation, Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment announced that they have finalized an agreement to release the film in IMAX 3D, continuing the partnership which began on Iron Man 2.[111] Branagh stated that the 3-D process initially made him cringe but said \"We came to feel that in our case 3-D could be the very good friend of story and character for a different kind of experience\". Although the film was shot in 2D, Feige stated that the \"special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3D\".[112] The post-credits scene that sees Nick Fury approach Erik Selvig to ask him to study the Tesseract, was directed by The Avengers's director, Joss Whedon.[113]\n\nBUF Compagnie served as the lead visual effects vendor working on the film,[114] with Digital Domain also providing work on the film.[115] some of the software used for the visual effects were Autodesk Softimage.[116] Branagh stated that BUF, who developed the effects for the race through space, were inspired by Hubble photography and other images of deep space. Branagh stated he sent paintings from classic studies by J. M. W. Turner to Digital Domain when creating Jotunheim.[117] Peter Butterworth, VFX supervisor and co-founder of Fuel VFX, said the most challenging task was interpreting what the Bifröst would look like, \"You can't Google what these things look like—they are totally imagined and within the heads of the stakeholders. So to extract that and interpret it for the big screen was an interesting challenge creatively. Technically, probably creating fluid simulations that could be art-directed and used for both the Bifröst and Odin's chamber shots. Part of the difficulty with solving these is that we had to ensure they would work in stereo.[118] In the film, Odin enters what is known as the \"Odinsleep\" in his chamber to regenerate. Butterworth stated, \"For Odin's Chamber, we developed a dome and curtain of light rays that hover over Odin's bed. This dome of light suggests harnessed power and energy that revitalizes him as he sleeps. We took a lot of reference from the natural world such as the corona of the sun and gave the sleep effect plenty of volume and space\".[118]\n\nThe film's score was written by composer Patrick Doyle, a frequent collaborator of Branagh. Doyle described Thor as \"the most commercially high profile film I have done since Frankenstein\",[119] adding that the composing process had the challenge of trying to find a tone that fit the duality of Asgard and Earth. Thus Doyle and Branagh had frequent discussions on the musical direction,[120] with the director suggesting a contemporary feel and having a balance between the music and \"grand images [that] were not in any way hyperbolized\", and the composer in turn implementing \"a strong sense of melody, which he responds to in my work\". As Doyle declared that his own Celtic background made him familiar with Norse mythology, an old Celtic folk song also provided the inspiration for Thor's leitmotif.[119] A soundtrack album was released by Buena Vista Records in April 2011.[121]\n\nThe film also features a song by the Foo Fighters, \"Walk\", in both a scene where a powerless Thor shares some boilermakers with Selvig in a roadhouse, and the film's closing credits. Marvel president Kevin Feige stated that \"Walk\" was a last minute addition, that the crew felt had \"these eerie appropriate lyrics and themes\" upon hearing it. Branagh in particular thought that \"these lyrics about learning to walk again\" were appropriate \"of [a] movie about redemption, learning to be a hero.\"[122]\n\nIn July 2010, Marvel Studios held a Thor panel at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con during which Kenneth Branagh, Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg discussed the film and showed some clips from it.[17] A few days later, this footage was leaked on the internet.[123] The first television advertisement was broadcast during Super Bowl XLV on the Fox network in the United States. The rate for advertising during the game was approximately $3 million per 30-second spot.[124] Marvel Studios and Acura launched a joint viral marketing promotion at the 2011 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo.[125] Other official promotional partners included Burger King, Dr. Pepper, 7 Eleven, and Visa.[126] In May 2011 Marvel Entertainment's President of Print, Animation and Digital, Dan Buckley, and Marvel Comics Editor-In-Chief, Axel Alonso, rang the NYSE closing bell in celebration of the theatrical release of Thor.[127]\n\nA post-credits scene in the film Iron Man 2 showed Coulson reporting the discovery of a large hammer in the desert. Rick Marshall of MTV News believed it to be the weapon Mjölnir belonging to Thor, writing, \"It continues the grand tradition of connecting the film to another property in development around the Marvel movie universe.\"[128] In the commentary track of Iron Man 2's home media, Iron Man 2's director, Jon Favreau, stated that \"this is a scene from [the set of] Thor \".[129]\n\nMarvel Animation announced a 26-episode animated series in November 2008, to air in late 2010 before the release of Marvel Studios' film.[130] The company released an animated direct-to-video film, Thor: Tales of Asgard, to coincide with the live-action film.[131]\n\nA video game titled Thor: God of Thunder based on the film was developed by Sega using the voices and likenesses of actors Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston and Jaimie Alexander, and was released on May 3, 2011.[132]\n\nThor held its world premiere at the Event Cinemas theatre in George Street, Sydney on April 17, 2011,[133] with the film opening on April 21, 2011 in Australia.[134] The following weekend it opened in 56 markets,[135] while the premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, California took place on May 2, 2011.[136] Thor opened on May 6, 2011 in the United States,[134] in 3,955 theaters (of which 214 were IMAX 3D and 2,737 in 3D, a record amount).[137][138][139] The film is part of Phase One of the MCU.[140]\n\nIn July 2011, Marvel Studios and Paramount Pictures announced the release of Thor on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray Disc and DVD. The discs were released by Paramount Home Media Distribution on September 13, 2011 in three editions: a single-disc DVD, a 2-disc Blu-ray-DVD combo pack, and a 3-disc Blu-ray/DVD/3D combo pack. All sets come with deleted scenes and a \"Road to The Avengers\" featurette. The 2-disc and 3-disc packs includes a digital copy, the first in a series of Marvel One-Shots, The Consultant, and 7 behind-the-scenes featurettes.[141]\n\nBranagh said that the DVD includes at least 20 minutes of deleted scenes. Branagh stated the footage contains \"things like the Asgardian parents, Odin and Frigga, played by the beautiful Rene Russo, there's some beautiful scenes in there that I think people will enjoy. And certainly Thor and Loki interacting in different ways that just fill in a little bit of a back story, that was part of our rehearsal and research.\"[142] In its first week of release, Thor took the number one spot on Blu-ray/DVD sales chart and topped Home Media Magazine's rental chart for the week.[143]\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One – Avengers Assembled\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[144] It was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on April 2, 2013.[145][146]\n\nThor grossed $181 million in the United States and Canada, and $268.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $449.3 million.[3] It was the 15th highest-grossing film of 2011.[147]\n\nThor earned $25.5 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada, including $3.3 million from Thursday previews,[137] for a total weekend gross of $65.7 million. $6.2 million of the gross came from IMAX 3D, while 60% of the gross was from 3D screenings.[138][139] It became the tenth highest-grossing film of 2011 in the United States and Canada,[148] and the highest-grossing comic-book film from May–August 2011.[149]\n\nThor's opening in Australia generated $5.8 million and placing second behind Universal Pictures' Fast Five. The film's box office was just 1% more than Iron Man opening in Australia in 2008, Marvel's most popular release at the time.[150] The following week, Thor opened in 56 markets and took in $89.2 million through the weekend.[135] The film's highest grossing markets were the United Kingdom ($22.5 million), Australia ($20.1 million) and Mexico ($19.5 million).[151]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 77%, with an average score of 6.7/10, based on 296 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"A dazzling blockbuster that tempers its sweeping scope with wit, humor, and human drama, Thor is mighty Marvel entertainment.\"[152] Metacritic assigned a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[153] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[154]\n\nRichard Kuipers of Variety stated, \"Thor delivers the goods so long as butt is being kicked and family conflict is playing out in celestial dimensions, but is less thrilling during the Norse warrior god's rather brief banishment on Earth\".[155] Megan Lehmann of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"The hammer-hurling god of thunder kicks off this superhero summer with a bang\".[156] In the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper liked the film \"Thanks in large part to a charming, funny and winning performance from Australian actor Chris Hemsworth in the title role, Thor is the most entertaining superhero debut since the original Spider-Man\".[157]\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it a negative review stating, \"Thor is a failure as a movie, but a success as marketing, an illustration of the ancient carnival tactic of telling the rubes anything to get them into the tent\".[158] A.O. Scott of The New York Times disliked the film, calling it \"an example of the programmed triumph of commercial calculation over imagination\".[159] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times had mixed feelings, describing the film as \"an aesthetic stand-off between predictable elements and unexpected ones\". Turan praised the performances of Hemsworth, Hopkins, and Elba, but found the special effects inconsistent and the Earth storyline derivative.[160]\n\nA sequel, Thor: The Dark World, directed by Alan Taylor, was released on November 8, 2013.[168][169] Hemsworth, Hiddleston, and Portman reprised their roles, along with others from the first film.[170] Zachary Levi replaced Dallas as Fandral, while Christopher Eccleston joined the cast as the Dark Elf Malekith.[171]\n\nThor: Ragnarok was released on November 3, 2017,[172] directed by Taika Waititi.[173] Eric Pearson and Craig Kyle & Christopher Yost wrote the screenplay,[174] with Kevin Feige again producing.[175] Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Hopkins, Elba, Asano, Levi, and Stevenson reprised their roles as Thor, Loki, Odin, Heimdall, Hogun, Fandral, and Volstagg, respectively,[176][177][178][179] while Mark Ruffalo and Benedict Cumberbatch appeared as Bruce Banner / Hulk and Stephen Strange respectively, reprising their roles from previous MCU films.[180][181] Cate Blanchett, Tessa Thompson, Jeff Goldblum and Karl Urban joined the cast as Hela, Valkyrie, Grandmaster, and Skurge, respectively.[173]\n\nA fourth film titled Thor: Love and Thunder was released on July 8, 2022.[182] Hemsworth, Thompson,[183] and Elba reprised their roles,[184] with Portman,[183] Alexander,[185] Dennings, and Skarsgård returning after not appearing in Ragnarok.[184] Portman portrayed her character taking on the mantle of Thor, similar to the comics.[186] Additionally, Chris Pratt, Pom Klementieff, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, and Sean Gunn reprise their roles as Guardians of the Galaxy members Peter Quill / Star-Lord, Mantis, Drax the Destroyer, Nebula, Groot, Rocket, and Kraglin Obfonteri.[187] Christian Bale joined the cast as the villain Gorr the God Butcher.[188]\n"

        "content": "This is an accepted version of this page\n\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger is a 2011 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures,[a] it is the fifth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Joe Johnston, written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America alongside Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper, Toby Jones, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, and Stanley Tucci. During World War II, Rogers, a frail man, is transformed into the super-soldier Captain America and must stop the Red Skull (Weaving) from using the Tesseract as an energy source for world domination.\n\nThe film began as a concept in 1997 and was scheduled for distribution by Artisan Entertainment. However, a lawsuit disrupted the project and was not settled until September 2003. In 2005, Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch, and planned to finance and release the film through Paramount Pictures. Directors Jon Favreau and Louis Leterrier were interested in directing the project before Johnston was approached in 2008. The principal characters were cast between March and June 2010. Production began in June, and filming took place in London, Manchester, Caerwent, Liverpool, and Los Angeles. Several different techniques were used by the visual effects company Lola to create the physical appearance of the character before he becomes Captain America.\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on July 19, 2011, and was released in the United States on July 22, as part of Phase One of the MCU. The film was commercially successful, grossing over $370 million worldwide. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised Evans' performance, the film's depiction of its 1940s time period, and Johnston's direction. Two sequels have been released: Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America: Civil War (2016).\n\nIn the present day, scientists in the Arctic uncover an old aircraft with someone frozen inside and a circular shield. In March 1942, during World War II, Nazi lieutenant general and Hydra leader Johann Schmidt steals a mysterious relic called the Tesseract,[b] which possesses untold godly powers, from the town of Tønsberg in German-occupied Norway.\n\nIn New York City, Steve Rogers is rejected for U.S. Army recruitment due to his small stature and poor health. While attending the Stark Expo, an event held by famous engineer Howard Stark, Rogers attempts to enlist again. Overhearing Rogers tell his best friend, James \"Bucky\" Barnes, that he wants to fight for his country, Dr. Abraham Erskine allows Rogers to enlist. He is recruited into the Strategic Scientific Reserve as part of a \"super-soldier\" experiment under Erskine, Stark, Colonel Chester Phillips, and British MI6 agent Peggy Carter. Phillips is not convinced by Erskine's claims that Rogers is the right person for the procedure until Rogers selflessly jumps on a grenade as part of a test. Erskine reveals to Rogers that he was a scientist under Schmidt, until the latter took a prototype version of the super-soldier formula that gave him superhuman strength but painfully changed his appearance.\n\nSchmidt and Dr. Arnim Zola harness the energies of the Tesseract to fuel Zola's inventions and Hydra's planned worldwide offensive. Schmidt discovers Erskine's location and sends an assassin, Heinz Kruger, to kill him. Erskine and Stark put Rogers through the super-soldier treatment, injecting him with the formula and dosing him with \"vita-rays\". After Rogers emerges from the experiment taller and more muscular, Kruger kills Erskine and flees with the last vial of the formula. Rogers pursues and captures Kruger, but the assassin avoids interrogation by committing suicide with a cyanide capsule. The vial is destroyed during the chase. With Erskine dead and his formula lost, U.S. Senator Brandt has Rogers tour the nation as \"Captain America\" to promote war bonds while scientists study his blood and attempt to reverse-engineer the formula. In 1943, while on tour in Italy performing for active servicemen, Rogers learns that Barnes's unit is MIA following a battle against Schmidt's forces. Rogers has Carter and Stark fly him behind enemy lines to mount a rescue. Rogers infiltrates Schmidt's fortress, frees Barnes and the other prisoners, and confronts Schmidt. The latter escapes, but first he removes a mask to reveal a red, skull-like visage that has earned him the sobriquet \"Red Skull\".\n\nRogers recruits Barnes and other freed prisoners to form the Howling Commandos. Stark outfits Rogers with a circular shield made of a rare, nearly indestructible metal called vibranium. Rogers and his team sabotage various Hydra operations while he and Carter begin to fall in love. In 1945, the team assaults a train carrying Zola. They capture him, but Barnes falls from the train to his apparent death.[c] Using information extracted from Zola, the final Hydra stronghold is located and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using WMDs on major American cities. Rogers climbs aboard Schmidt's super-bomber as it takes off. During the subsequent fight, the Tesseract is freed from its container and Schmidt picks it up, opening a portal into space which he is pulled through. The Tesseract burns through the plane and falls into the ocean. Seeing no way to land the plane without risking its weapons detonating, Rogers radios Carter to say goodbye before crashing in the Arctic. After the war ends, Stark recovers the Tesseract from the ocean floor but is unable to locate the aircraft and Rogers is presumed dead.\n\nRogers awakens in a 1940s-style hospital room. Hearing a radio broadcast of a baseball game that he attended in 1941, Rogers grows suspicious and escapes from the room. He finds himself in contemporary Times Square, where S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury informs him that he has been asleep for almost 70 years. In a post-credits scene, Fury approaches Rogers and proposes a mission with worldwide ramifications.[d]\n\nSamuel L. Jackson reprises his role as Nick Fury, the director of the super-spy agency, S.H.I.E.L.D.[38] Kenneth Choi appears as Jim Morita, a Japanese-American member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Choi said he was the last actor to audition for the part and that he read sides from Saving Private Ryan. About his preparation for the role, Choi said, \"[I] did a lot of WWII research especially in regards to the 'Nisei' soldiers, or Japanese-American soldiers. I wanted to get as much true, real-life information for a guy like Jim Morita fighting in WWII. I felt that if I had built a factual basis for him, I could then let go and permit the character to exist in the Marvel Universe, which allows for a lot of imaginative circumstances.\"[39] Bruno Ricci stars as Jacques Dernier, a French member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Ricci auditioned for and got the part while filming the French series The Hawk.[40] JJ Feild appears as James Montgomery Falsworth, a British member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Feild called his part in the film \"a very physical job. I play one of the Captain's sidekicks so I've been running around shooting things and blowing things up and trying to look cool for about a year.\"[41] Additionally, Richard Armitage portrays Heinz Kruger, the Red Skull's top assassin,[42] Lex Shrapnel portrays Gilmore Hodge, a candidate for the super soldier program,[43] Michael Brandon portrays Brandt, a United States Senator who recognizes the PR potential of Captain America.[44] Jeff Goldblum had originally been approached to play the part; he later played Grandmaster in Thor: Ragnarok.[45] David Bradley appears as the church keeper where the Tesseract is held.[46] Natalie Dormer portrays Lorraine, a private who attempts to seduce Rogers,[47] and Jenna Coleman appears as Connie, Bucky's date at the World Expo.[48] Laura Haddock, who would go on to portray Meredith Quill in Guardians of the Galaxy, has a brief appearance as an autograph seeker. Writer and director of Guardians of the Galaxy James Gunn jokingly claimed that this was Peter Quill's grandmother.[49] Stan Lee has a cameo appearance as a general.[50]\n\n\"[Captain America] wants to serve his country, but he's not this sort of jingoistic American flag-waver. He's just a good person. We make a point of that in the script: Don't change who you are once you go from Steve Rogers to this super-soldier; you have to stay who you are inside, that's really what's important more than your strength and everything... It's also the idea that this is not about America so much as it is about the spirit of doing the right thing. It's an international cast and an international story. It's about what makes America great and what make the rest of the world great too.\"\n\nIn April 1997, Marvel Studios was in negotiations with Mark Gordon and Gary Levinsohn to produce Captain America, and Larry Wilson and Leslie Bohem were set to write a script.[52] In May 2000, Marvel teamed with Artisan Entertainment to help finance the film.[53] However, a lawsuit arose between Marvel Comics and Joe Simon over the ownership of Captain America copyrights, disrupting the development process of the film. The lawsuit was eventually settled in September 2003.[54] Following the settlement, Marvel was preparing to license the film rights to Warner Bros. until producer David Maisel suggested that the company produce the film themselves.[55] In 2005, Marvel received a $525 million investment from Merrill Lynch, allowing them to independently produce ten films, including Captain America. Paramount Pictures agreed to distribute the film.[53][56][57]\nOriginally, the film would stand alone; producer Kevin Feige said \"about half\" the movie would be set during World War II before moving into the modern day.[58] Producer Avi Arad said, \"The biggest opportunity with Captain America is as a man 'out of time', coming back today, looking at our world through the eyes of someone who thought the perfect world was small-town United States. Sixty years go by, and who are we today? Are we better?\" He cited the Back to the Future trilogy as an influence, and claimed he had \"someone in mind to be the star, and definitely someone in mind to be the director\".[59] In February 2006, Arad hoped to have a summer 2008 theatrical release date.[60] Jon Favreau approached Arad to direct the film as a comedy, but he chose to make Iron Man instead.[61] In April 2006, David Self was hired to write the script.[62] He explained that Captain America was his favorite superhero as a child because \"my dad told me I could one day be Captain America\".[63] Joe Johnston met with Marvel to discuss directing the film.[64]\n\nCaptain America was put on hold during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. However, in January 2008, Marvel Entertainment reached an interim comprehensive agreement with the Writers Guild of America that would put writers immediately back to work on various projects that were under the company's development.[65] On May 5, 2008 (after the success of Iron Man), Marvel announced the film The First Avenger: Captain America (the working title) for release on May 6, 2011 (before being pushed back to July 22).[66] Louis Leterrier, director of The Incredible Hulk, viewed some of the concept art being created for the film and was impressed enough to offer his services, but Marvel turned him down.[67] Johnston finally signed on in November 2008,[64] and he hired Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely to rewrite.[68] Feige cited Johnston's directorial work on October Sky and The Rocketeer and his special effects work on the original Star Wars trilogy to explain why he was an appropriate choice. Raiders of the Lost Ark, in which Johnston worked for the special effects, was an influence on the film, because they hoped the film would not feel like a period piece.[69]\n\nWhen asked whether anti-US sentiments would affect the film's box office, Feige said, \"Marvel is perceived pretty well around the world right now, and I think putting another uber-Marvel hero into the worldwide box office would be a good thing. ... We have to deal with much the same way that Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize,\" similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s.[58] Likewise, Arad noted, \"Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [on] that basis it will be very successful\".[70] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, \"The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood. Discussions in all our development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted\".[71] The creative team opted to not push the title character to fight any members of the Nazi Party like in a usual World War II movie, as their goal was to depict the conflict through the Marvel Universe's \"prism\". Although they didn't have problems to feature Nazis in the film, with Feige loving an iconic Captain America cover where the character punches Adolf Hitler out, the team felt that using Hydra as the main antagonists would make them be \"true\" to the comic book's many aspects. It was because of this that Markus and McFeely found sense in using the Cosmic Cube, already set up in Thor, as the film's MacGuffin, while using a younger Howard Stark as a key ally for the protagonist would bring, according to Markus, \"that Tony Starkness\".[72]\n\nIn December 2009, director Joe Johnston indicated that he planned to start filming in April 2010.[73] In a separate interview that month, he described the film's pre-production: \"Rick Heinrichs is production-designing and we're set up down in Manhattan Beach, California. ... We have eight or ten really talented artists, and we all just sit around all day and draw pictures and say, 'Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we could do this?' It's that phase of the production where money doesn't matter: 'Let's put all the greatest stuff up on the wall and [then later] see what we can afford.'\" The film, he said, will begin \"in 1942, 1943\" during World War II. \"The stuff in the '60s and '70s [comic books] we're sort of avoiding. We're going back to the '40s, and then forward to what they're doing with Captain America now\".[74] In February 2010, Johnston stated that the Invaders will appear in \"the entire second half\" of the film,[75] leading fans to speculate this was the World War II-era Marvel superhero team of that name,[76] and in November, Johnston refuted speculation that the Sub-Mariner, an Invaders team-member in the comics, would be included.[77] Johnston later explained that \"the Invaders\" had been discussed simply as a possible name for the squad of commandos Captain America leads in the film. Christopher Markus, one of the screenwriters, said the unnamed group was \"called the Howling Commandos in the script, but no one says that out loud\".[76]\n\nThe design as a whole tried to create technology that could be built in the 1940s, though with the added Cube technology in Hydra's case. Abandoned Nazi projects or actual vehicles from the period were used as inspiration. Daniel Simon, who was previously responsible for many vehicle designs in Tron: Legacy,[78] was appointed Lead Vehicle Designer.[79] Director Johnston cited Simon's book Cosmic Motors as a reason to trust his influence, saying \"he's sort of the guy I wanted to be when I was designing stuff for Star Wars\".[80] The Red Skull's car, for instance, was based on two Mercedes-Benz vehicles from the 1930s, the 540K and the G4.[79]\n\nIn March 2010, it was reported that Chris Evans was cast as Captain America and Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull;[11] Marvel Studios confirmed the latter in May.[81] John Krasinski, Channing Tatum, Chace Crawford, Ryan Phillippe, Garrett Hedlund, Michael Cassidy, Patrick Flueger, Scott Porter, Wilson Bethel,[11] Mike Vogel, Dane Cook,[82] Ryan McPartlin,[83] Ethan Peck,[84] Zachary Levi,[85] Glen Powell,[86] Jensen Ackles, Wyatt Russell, and Chris Pratt were also considered for the role of Captain America.[15] Casting director Sarah Halley Finn said Evans was cast in part because of his relatable humility alongside a vulnerability and strength that could portray both \"skinny\" Steve Rogers and Captain America.[15] In April 2010, Sebastian Stan, who also originally auditioned for the title role, was cast as Bucky Barnes. Stan is contracted for multiple films.[27][87] Also in April, Marvel announced that Hayley Atwell had been cast as Peggy Carter, and that the film's name had been changed from The First Avenger: Captain America to Captain America: The First Avenger.[88] Keira Knightley, Alice Eve, and Emily Blunt were also considered for the role of Peggy Carter.[88] The next day it was reported that Joss Whedon would be rewriting the script as part of his negotiation to write and direct The Avengers. Whedon said in August, \"I just got to make some character connections. The structure of the thing was really tight and I loved it, but there were a couple of opportunities to find his voice a little bit —and some of the other characters' — and make the connections so that you understood exactly why he wanted to be who he wanted to be. And progressing through the script to flesh it out a little bit\".[89] Samuel L. Jackson revealed in an interview that he would reprise his role as Nick Fury in the film.[38]\n\nIn May, Toby Jones entered final negotiations to play Arnim Zola.[32] Iron Man director Jon Favreau said a younger Howard Stark would appear in the film, played by Dominic Cooper.[29][30] Atwell revealed that Tommy Lee Jones would have a role in the film.[90] By June, Neal McDonough was in talks to play Dum Dum Dugan.[91] Four days later, he confirmed he was taking the part.[92] The same day, Stanley Tucci joined the cast as Dr. Abraham Erskine, the scientist who created the super-soldier serum.[36]\n\nPrincipal photography began on June 28, 2010,[93] with the working title FrostBite.[94] On the same day, Marvel confirmed that Lee Jones had been cast to play US Army Colonel Chester Phillips.[18] The next day Marvel confirmed that Cooper would portray the younger version of Howard Stark, the character played by John Slattery in Iron Man 2.[95] It was announced that the film would shoot in London in late July and was expected to include scenes featuring key London landmarks.[96] War scenes were filmed in September at the former Royal Navy Propellant Factory in the Welsh village of Caerwent.[97][98] Filming was scheduled to take place that month in the Northern Quarter of Manchester, where parts of the 2004 film Alfie and the 2009 Sherlock Holmes had been shot,[99] followed by the Stanley Dock area of Liverpool, both doubling for the period's Lower East Side of Manhattan.[100] Further scenes were scheduled to be shot in Liverpool's Albert Dock.[101] Johnston included a scene of a technology fair that includes in passing a display case containing the 1940s android superhero known as the original Human Torch, another character, like Captain America, in comics published by Marvel Comics' predecessor, Timely Comics.[102]\n\nSome filming also took place at Pinewood Studios,[103] with Pinewood's A Stage, their South Dock, and their Underwater Stage all being used by the crew. Six months of filming also occurred at Shepperton Studios, with nine stages being used.[104]\n\nIn July 2010, Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige said that both this film and Thor would be released in 3-D.[105] Johnston did a one-day test shooting with a 3-D rig, rather than shooting in 2-D and converting, and found it \"a nightmare\" due to bulky gear, calibration issues and restricted filmmaking options. Nevertheless, he said he believes 3-D is \"a new challenge and it's exciting\". Feige insisted that the conversion would not compromise the film's image quality, as the decision to release the film in 3-D was made early in development, and that \"an unprecedented amount of time\" would be devoted to the conversion process, to render all the film's visual effects in true 3-D.[105] In November 2010, Stanley Tucci stated that he had completed filming his scenes and that the rest of the production would wrap in about three weeks.[106]\n\nIn February 2011, it was announced that Alan Silvestri had been chosen to compose the film score.[107] In March 2011, it was reported that Captain America: The First Avenger would be undergoing reshoots in the United Kingdom and in Los Angeles in April 2011.[108][109] A scene was also filmed in New York City's Times Square on April 23, 2011.[110]\n\nThe film features nearly 1,600 visual effects shots, which were split between thirteen different companies.[111] To achieve the appearance of the skinny, pre-serum Steve Rogers, director Joe Johnston stated that he used two major techniques:\n\nMost of the shots were done by an L.A. company called LOLA that specializes in digital \"plastic surgery\". The technique involved shrinking Chris in all dimensions. We shot each skinny Steve scene at least four times; once like a normal scene with Chris and his fellow actors in the scene, once with Chris alone in front of a green screen so his element could be reduced digitally, again with everyone in the scene but with Chris absent so that the shrunken Steve could be re-inserted into the scene, and finally with a body double mimicking Chris's actions in case the second technique were required. When Chris had to interact with other characters in the scene, we had to either lower Chris or raise the other actors on apple boxes or elevated walkways to make skinny Steve shorter in comparison. For close-ups, Chris' fellow actors had to look at marks on his chin that represented where his eyes would be after the shrinking process, and Chris had to look at marks on the tops of the actor's head to represent their eyes. ... The second technique involved grafting Chris's head onto the body double. This technique was used mostly when Chris was sitting or lying down, or when a minimum of physical acting was required....[112]\nCaptain America's shield, which serves as both a defensive tool and a weapon, came in four types: metal, fiberglass, rubber, and computer graphics (CG).[111] Prop master Barry Gibbs specified that \"We had the 'hero shield,' which was made of aluminum, for our beauty shots [and] close-up work. We then created a lighter shield that was aluminum-faced with a fiberglass back, for use on a daily basis. ... And then we had a stunt shield made of polyurethane, which is sort of a synthetic rubber ... and we made an ultrasoft one we put on [Evans'] back, so that if there were an accident, it wouldn't hurt him\".[76] Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans \"would practice swinging the practical shield so he knew the arc and the speed at which he should move. We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it. Then we would add in a CG shield\".[111]\n\nHugo Weaving, who portrayed the Red Skull, wore a latex mask conceived by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky and they wanted to make it look like tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.[111]\n\nClosing credits were created by visual effects firm Rok!t by means of 3-D and stereoscopic processing that used iconic American war propaganda, such as James Montgomery Flagg's Uncle Sam recruitment poster from World War I and J. Howard Miller's \"We Can Do It!\" poster from World War II.[113]\n\nThe soundtrack album for Captain America: The First Avenger includes the original score by Alan Silvestri, as well as an original song, \"Star Spangled Man\", with music composed by Alan Menken and lyrics by David Zippel. The soundtrack was recorded at Air Studios in London and released by Walt Disney Records on July 19, 2011.[114]\n\nAt the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con, some footage that had been shot in the previous week was shown at the San Diego Convention Center.[22] The first television advertisement aired during Super Bowl XLV on the Fox network in the United States. Paramount paid $3 million to run the 30-second advertisement.[115] The first full trailer was released in March 2011.[116] In May 2011, the USO girls from the film performed aboard the USS Intrepid at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum as a part of the 2011 Fleet Week celebration in New York City.[117] In June 2011, Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins teamed with Marvel to search for real-life super-soldiers. The contest sought nominations for veterans or active U.S. servicepersons making a difference where they live or serve.[118] In July 2011, Paramount Pictures promoted the film during an Independence Day celebration hosted by the Chicago White Sox.[119] Promotional partners include Harley-Davidson, Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins.[120]\n\nIn February 2011, Marvel Comics launched the eight-issue digital comic Captain America: First Vengeance, on the same day as the first trailer aired. Written by Fred Van Lente and featuring a rotation of artists, the story is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Each of the eight issues focuses on a specific character from the movie, heroes and villains alike, and what brought them to the point where the movie begins.[121]\n\nSega announced a video game tie-in titled Captain America: Super Soldier, that was released on July 19, 2011, for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Nintendo DS.[122] Marvel released the mobile game, Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty, in July 2011.[123] A toy line was released as well.[124]\n\nThe world premiere of Captain America: The First Avenger was held on July 19, 2011, at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California.[125] The film was screened at San Diego Comic-Con on July 21, 2011.[126] It was commercially released in the United States and Canada on July 22, 2011.[127][128] Captain America: The First Avenger is part of Phase One of the MCU.[129]\n\nParamount opted against altering the American-centric title when distributing to foreign territories, instead offering international markets a choice between the official title and the alternative The First Avenger. Many international distributors chose to retain the original title, believing the franchise name to be more identifiable than the alternative, and that the latter would risk losing ticket sales. Three countries chose the alternative title: Russia, South Korea, and Ukraine. An \"insider\" speaking to The New York Times explained that the name change in these countries stemmed from cultural and political concerns, though Marvel and Paramount both declined to state an official reason.[130] In July 2011, it was thought that the film would not be released in China because of a policy limiting the number of foreign films screened there each year,[130] but it eventually opened there in the second weekend of September.[131]\n\nDays before the film's release, a teaser trailer for The Avengers that served as a post-credits scene of Captain America: The First Avenger was briefly leaked online. Entertainment Weekly speculated it came from a preview screening and described the footage as \"shaky, fuzzy, flickering and obviously filmed on a cell phone\".[132] Captain America: The First Avenger was formatted and screened in IMAX for the first time on August 31, 2018, as part of Marvel Studios' 10-year anniversary IMAX festival.[133]\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger was released by Paramount Home Entertainment on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D and DVD on October 25, 2011. The three-disc set includes the film on Blu-ray in high-definition 3D and in high definition 2D, as well as on standard definition DVD with a digital copy. The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD combo pack includes a high-definition presentation of the film and a standard-definition presentation with a digital copy. Both sets include over an hour of bonus material, including the short film A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, a sneak peek of The Avengers, six behind-the-scenes featurettes, and deleted scenes with commentary by director Joe Johnston, director of photography Shelly Johnson and editor Jeff Ford.[134] In its first week of release, Captain America: The First Avenger topped the Blu-ray and DVD sales charts, selling 1.54 million Blu-ray units and 726,000 DVD units and making a combined total of $52.6 million.[135][136]\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One – Avengers Assembled\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[137] It was released on April 2, 2013.[138][139] Captain America: The First Avenger was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Ultra HD Blu-ray on February 26, 2019.[140]\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger earned $176.7 million in North America and $193.9 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $370.6 million.[4]\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger opened on July 22, 2011, in the United States and earned $4 million in midnight showings, outgrossing other 2011 original superhero films like Thor and Green Lantern as well as the prequel X-Men: First Class, which all made between $3.25 million and $3.5 million in Friday midnights.[141] On Friday, the film opened at the number one spot at the American and Canadian box office with $25.7 million.[142] It then went on to make $65.1 million in what was the second highest-grossing opening weekend for a superhero film in 2011, behind Thor ($65.7 million).[143] At the time of its release, Captain America: The First Avenger became the third highest-grossing motion picture set during the World War II era, after Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbor.[144]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 80%, with an average score of 7/10, based on 276 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"With plenty of pulpy action, a pleasantly retro vibe, and a handful of fine performances, Captain America is solidly old-fashioned blockbuster entertainment.\"[145] Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score, rated the film 66 out of 100 based on 43 reviews from critics indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[146] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[147]\n\nRoger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave Captain America: The First Avenger a positive review, saying, \"Johnston has delivered a light, clever and deftly balanced adventure picture with real lump in the throat nostalgia, with Nazis – who make the best villains, and with loving references to Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark.'\"[148] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times remarked, \"I enjoyed the movie. I appreciated the 1940s period settings and costumes, which were a break with the usual generic cityscapes. I admired the way that director Joe Johnston propelled the narrative. I got a sense of a broad story, rather than the impression of a series of sensational set pieces. If Marvel is wise, it will take this and Iron Man as its templates\".[149] A. O. Scott of The New York Times declared it \"pretty good fun\".[150]\n\nKarina Longworth of The Village Voice gave the film a negative review, calling it \"[A] hokey, hacky, two-hour-plus exercise in franchise transition/price gouging, complete with utterly unnecessary post-converted 3-D\".[151] Peter Debruge of Variety said, \"Captain America: The First Avenger plays like a by-the-numbers prequel for Marvel Studios' forthcoming The Avengers movie\".[152] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter had mixed feelings about the film, writing, \"As the last Marvel prequel that includes two Iron Man and Incredible Hulk movies before next summer's The Avengers, this one feels perhaps a little too simplistic and routine\".[153]\n\n\n\nA sequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, directed by Anthony and Joseph Russo, was released on April 4, 2014.[162][163] Evans, Stan, Atwell, Toby Jones, and Jackson reprise their roles as Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Peggy Carter, Arnim Zola, and Nick Fury, respectively. They are joined by Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Cobie Smulders, Frank Grillo, Emily VanCamp, and Robert Redford as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, Sam Wilson / Falcon, Maria Hill, Brock Rumlow, Sharon Carter, and Alexander Pierce, respectively.[164]\n\nCaptain America: Civil War was released on May 6, 2016, and again is directed by the Russo brothers.[165][166] Evans, Johansson, Stan, Mackie, Grillo and VanCamp reprise their roles from The Winter Soldier,[167][168] and they are joined by Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, Paul Bettany as Vision, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch, Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man and William Hurt as Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross[169] all reprising roles from previous MCU films. Chadwick Boseman, Tom Holland and Daniel Brühl also star as T'Challa / Black Panther, Peter Parker / Spider-Man and Helmut Zemo, respectively.\n\nIn September 2013, Marvel released the One-Shot short film, Agent Carter, on Iron Man 3's home media release, featuring Atwell reprising her role as Peggy Carter. Set a year after The First Avenger, the film sees Carter on an SSR mission post-World War II.[170]\n"

        "content": "\n\nMarvel's The Avengers[5] (titled Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland[1][6] and commonly referred to as simply The Avengers) is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,[a] it is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by Joss Whedon, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the Avengers, alongside Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury and the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton to form a team capable of stopping Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.\n\nThe film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Stark (Downey), Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the time portrayed by Edward Norton),[b] and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Romanoff in March 2009, Renner as Barton in June 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner in July 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots.\n\nThe Avengers premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on April 11, 2012, and was released in the United States on May 4, as the final film in Phase One of the MCU. The film received praise for Whedon's direction and screenplay, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score. It grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release and the highest-grossing film of 2012. It was the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, The Avengers was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in an Empire magazine poll. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 85th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Three sequels have been released: Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).\n\nThe Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the representative of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for obtaining the Tesseract,[c] a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises to provide Loki with an army to conquer Earth. Nick Fury, director of the covert agency S.H.I.E.L.D., arrives at a remote research facility where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a team studying the Tesseract. It suddenly activates and opens a portal, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki steals the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him.\n\nIn response, Fury reactivates the \"Avengers Initiative\". Agent Natasha Romanoff travels to Kolkata to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner so he can trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Fury approaches Steve Rogers to discuss his knowledge of the Tesseract, and Agent Phil Coulson visits Tony Stark so he can check Selvig's research. Loki is in Stuttgart, where Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract. This leads to a confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., his adoptive brother Thor arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. Stark and Rogers intervene, and Loki is imprisoned in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying base, the Helicarrier.\n\nThe Avengers disagree on how to approach Loki and become argumentative once they realize S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to use the Tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction to use against extraterrestrial threats. During the argument, Loki's agents attack the Helicarrier, and in the chaos Banner transforms into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers restart the damaged engine while Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff subdues Barton, freeing him from Loki's influence. Loki escapes after mortally wounding Coulson. Fury uses Coulson's subsequent death to motivate the Avengers to work together as a team. Loki uses the Tesseract and a generator Selvig built to open a portal above Stark Tower in New York City to bring his Chitauri fleet and start his invasion.\n\nRogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and the Hulk work together to protect New York from the Chitauri. The Hulk incapacitates Loki while Romanoff learns from Selvig, now freed from Loki's mind control, that Loki's scepter can shut down the generator. Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and flies it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile destroys the Chitauri mothership and disables their forces on Earth. Stark becomes unconscious, and his suit loses power, leaving him freefalling towards Earth. The Avengers manage to catch and resuscitate him, while Romanoff uses Loki's scepter to close the wormhole. In the aftermath, Thor transports an imprisoned Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, where Loki will face Asgardian justice.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master[d] about the failed attack on Earth.\n\nClark Gregg appears as Phil Coulson, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent overseeing many of the division's field operations.[40] Gregg was cast as part of a multi-picture deal with Marvel.[41] He noted that his role was expanded in The Avengers, expressing: \"[What] Agent Coulson had become in terms of the import of this particular story, and how important his job is in bringing the Avengers together, it kind of felt a little surreal, like somebody was playing a prank and that wasn't the real script. But it wasn't, it was the real thing, I got to show up and do that stuff, and it felt like such an amazing payoff to what the journey had been and the fact I had been doing it for five years.\"[42] Gregg said Whedon provided insight into his character's backstory, particularly about Coulson being a fan of Captain America.[42] Cobie Smulders appears as Maria Hill, a high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent working closely with Nick Fury.[43] Smulders, initially considered by Whedon for his unproduced live-action Wonder Woman film, was selected from a short list of potential actresses including Morena Baccarin. Her deal integrated her into nine films.[44][45] Regarding her preparation, Smulders said, \"I hired this amazing black-ops trainer to teach me how to hold a gun, take me to a shooting range, how to hit, how to hold myself, how to walk and basically how to look. I don't do a ton of fighting in the movie, which is why I wasn't offered a trainer, but I wanted to look like I had the ability to.\"[46] On relating to the character, Smulders said, \"I can relate to her being a mom and being a businesswoman and trying to work full-time and raising a family and having a career. We're asked to do a lot of things these days. I feel she is just all about her job and keeping things going.\"[47]\n\nGwyneth Paltrow and Maximiliano Hernández reprise their roles as Pepper Potts and Jasper Sitwell, respectively, from previous MCU films.[48] Paul Bettany returns to voice J.A.R.V.I.S.[48] Frequent Whedon collaborator Alexis Denisof portrays \"the Other\", while Damion Poitier portrays his master, Thanos (unnamed in the film), in a post-credits scene.[49] Powers Boothe and Jenny Agutter appear as members of the World Security Council, later revealed to be Gideon Malick and Councilwoman Hawley.[50][51] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance in a news report.[52] Additionally, Harry Dean Stanton cameos as a security guard, and Polish film director Jerzy Skolimowski appears as Georgi Luchkov, Romanoff's interrogator.[53] Warren Kole has a brief role as a S.H.I.E.L.D. bridge tech who is caught playing Galaga.[54] Enver Gjokaj and Ashley Johnson, the former who would later play Daniel Sousa in the series Agent Carter (2015–2016), appear as a police officer and a waitress named Beth, respectively.[55][56]\n\n\"It goes back to the very first incarnation of The Avengers, it goes to The Ultimates, it goes to everything about it. It makes no sense, it's ridiculous. There's a thunder god, there's a green 'id' giant rage monster, there's Captain America from the 40s, there's Tony Stark who definitely doesn't get along with anybody. Ultimately these people don't belong together and the whole movie is about finding yourself from community. And finding that you not only belong together but you need each other, very much. Obviously this will be expressed through punching but it will be the heart of the film.\"\n\nIdeas for a film based on the Avengers began in 2003,[58] with Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first announcing plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures.[59] Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio's intention was to release individual films for the main characters to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them before merging the characters together in a crossover film.[60] Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote The Incredible Hulk, became attached to the film in 2006,[58] and was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 2007.[61] In the wake of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man, and The Avengers.[62] After the successful release of Iron Man (2008) in May, the company set a July 2011 release date for The Avengers.[63] In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.[64]\n\nCasting began in October 2008 with Downey's signing.[12] Although Don Cheadle was reported to reprise his Iron Man 2 role of War Machine for The Avengers, he later stated that he did not think the character would appear in the film.[12][65] Simultaneously, two major developments occurred for Marvel: Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film,[12] and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films—Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)—at their Manhattan Beach, California complex.[66] In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in Iron Man 2 and other films.[38] In September 2009, Edward Norton, who played Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk, stated he was open to returning in the film.[67] The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated he would not direct the film but would \"definitely have input and a say\". Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, \"It's going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with Avengers, you're going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor [...] [Mixing] the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it's going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created\".[68] In March 2009, Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt in portraying Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2, a deal that subsequently attached her to The Avengers.[29] The following day, Marvel announced that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later.[69] Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film's cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.[26]\n\nIn July 2009, Penn discussed the crossover process, stating, \"My job is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that finally we're mimicking that comic book structure where all of these movies are connected. . . There's just a board that tracks 'Here's where everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie'. . . I'm pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the movie, to draw boards so that we're all working off the same visual ideas. But the exigencies of production take first priority\".[70] Initially, Penn attempted to reduce Thor's role in the script due to doubts about the character's ability to succeed on film. However, he changed his mind once Hemsworth was cast as Thor.[71] Although the film always intended to use Loki as its villain, Penn noted that early discussions had considered using Red Skull.[72]\n\nIn January 2010, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige was asked if it would be challenging to blend the fantasy of Thor with the high-tech science fiction in Iron Man and The Avengers. \"No,\" he said, \"because we're doing the Jack Kirby/Stan Lee/Walt Simonson/J. Michael Straczynski Thor. We're not doing the blow-the-dust-off-of-the-old-Norse-book-in-your-library Thor. And in the Thor of the Marvel Universe, there's a race called the Asgardians. And we're linked through this Tree of Life that we're unaware of. It's real science, but we don't know about it yet. The 'Thor' movie is about teaching people that\".[73] In March, it was reported that Penn had completed the first draft of the script, and that Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada and Avengers comic-book writer Brian Michael Bendis had received copies.[74] Also in March, Chris Evans accepted an offer to play Captain America in three films including The Avengers.[16]\n\n\"People forget that we started filming Avengers before either Thor or Captain America were released. What if people hated Thor? What if people thought Loki was ridiculous? What if people didn't buy this super soldier frozen in ice? We were in the first quarter of production on a giant movie at that time, and we weren't going to stop. It was sort of all in at that point.\"\n\nBy April 2010, Joss Whedon was nearing the completion of a deal to direct the film and to revise Penn's script,[76] and was officially announced in July 2010.[77] Regarding the hiring, Arad stated: \"My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer [...] It's part of his life so you know he is going to protect it [...] I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better\".[78] Feige added, \"I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it [...] we want[ed] to find a director that's on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is.\"[79] Whedon stated at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con that what drew him to the film is that he loves how \"these people shouldn't be in the same room let alone on the same team—and that is the definition of family\".[80]\n\nWhen Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not \"have anything\" and they should \"pretend this draft never happened\".[81] Part of Whedon's issue was the lack of character connections in Penn's draft, which necessitated Whedon to begin \"at square one\".[58] Whedon went on to write a five-page treatment of his plan for the film and created the tagline \"Avengers: Some Assembly Required\", riffing on the \"Avengers Assemble\" slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and that he get the film done for its May 2012 release.[81] The script went through \"a lot of insane iterations of what might be\", according to Whedon. There was a point when it was not certain Johansson would star in the film, so he \"wrote a huge bunch of pages starring The Wasp\",[58] and wanted Zooey Deschanel to play the character.[82] He also was \"worried that one British character actor [(Hiddleston)] was not enough to take on Earth's mightiest heroes, and that we'd feel like we were rooting for the overdog. So I wrote a huge draft with Ezekiel Stane, Obadiah Stane's son, in it.\" Once all of the actors were \"locked in place the movie stayed on mission.\" Whedon noted that the characters used do not have the same issue, unlike the X-Men. He felt \"these guys just don't belong together\" before realizing their interactions could be like The Dirty Dozen (1967). Whedon also referenced Dr. Strangelove (1964), The Abyss (1989), His Girl Friday (1940), and Black Hawk Down (2001). Whedon would ultimately share final screenplay credit with Penn, though Whedon noted he \"fought\" for sole credit and was \"very upset about it.\" Penn felt the two \"could have collaborated more, but that was not his choice. He wanted to do it his way, and I respect that.\"[58]\n\nThe casting process continued throughout much of 2010, with the additions of Jeremy Renner,[31] Mark Ruffalo,[19] and Clark Gregg.[40] Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to bring back.[83] \"We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers,\" stated Feige. \"Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks.\"[84] In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it \"purposefully misleading\" and an \"inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light\".[85] In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career and did not want to be associated with only one character.[86]\n\nIn August 2010, it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February.[87] In October 2010, Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York[88] and the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York City, were announced as filming locations,[89] with set construction slated to begin in November,[88] but as Whedon later explained, \"Originally we were supposed to be in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed to be in New York, and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque.\"[5] Also that October, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115 million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3 (2013) and The Avengers.[90] The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8 percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit—placement of the company's production logo on marketing materials and the film's opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads \"Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures\", though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount's Epix retained pay TV rights.[7]\n\nIn December 2010, Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson and Marvel Studios Co-president Louis D'Esposito announced that The Avengers would primarily film in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011. Parts of the film were also slated to be shot in Michigan,[91] but plans to film in Detroit were scrapped after Governor Rick Snyder proposed a budget that would eliminate a film tax incentive.[92] Three months later, in March, Governor of Ohio John Kasich announced during Mayor Frank G. Jackson's State of the City address that The Avengers would also film in Cleveland.[93]\n\nConcept illustrator and designer of Iron Man's Mark VII armor, Phil Saunders, stated that \"Joss Whedon was looking for something that had the 'cool' factor of the suitcase suit [from Iron Man 2], while still being a fully armored, heavy-duty suit that could take on an army in the final battle.\" To achieve this, Saunders combined ideas proposed in Iron Man 2 with some concepts abandoned in the first Iron Man film, creating a modular suit featuring large ammo packets on the arms and a backpack.[94] Additionally, the Science & Entertainment Exchange provided science consultation for the film.[95]\n\nCasting reached its final stages the following year. In February 2011, Cobie Smulders was cast in the role of Maria Hill,[45] after participating in screen tests conducted by Marvel for the role of a key S.H.I.E.L.D. member, whom Samuel L. Jackson described as Nick Fury's sidekick. Morena Baccarin, Jessica Lucas, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were also considered for the role.[44] Over the successive months, the film's cast expanded to include Stellan Skarsgård,[36] Paul Bettany,[96] and Gwyneth Paltrow.[97] Paltrow was cast at Downey's insistence; prior to this, Whedon had not intended the film to include supporting characters from the heroes' individual films, commenting, \"You need to separate the characters from their support systems in order to create the isolation you need for a team.\"[98]\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 25, 2011, at Albuquerque Studios in Albuquerque, New Mexico,[99][91] with the working title Group Hug.[100] In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald sustained a head injury while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after being struck by an arrow. Despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and resumed work on set, as confirmed by a Marvel spokesperson to TMZ.[101] Second unit filming occurred in the Butler area, about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the following month.[102] Additionally, a chase sequence was shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania, at Creekside Mushroom Farms, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.[103]\n\nProduction shifted to Cleveland, Ohio in August 2011, where filming spanned four weeks. The city's East 9th Street was selected as a stand-in for New York City's 42nd Street, serving as the backdrop for climactic battle scenes.[104] Army Reserve soldiers from the 391st Military Police Battalion, based in Columbus, Ohio, participated in the background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland. Staff Sergeant Michael T. Landis noted that the involvement of real soldiers enhanced the realism of the scenes and portrayed the military positively, citing their ability to provide on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms.[105] The NASA Plum Brook Station near Sandusky, Ohio, specifically its Space Power Facility, doubled as a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility.[106] Filming also occurred at the Chevrolet powertrain plant in Parma, Ohio, where a series of explosions were captured for the battle sequence originating in Cleveland.[107] Additional scenes were shot at Public Square and the Detroit–Superior Bridge,[108] with Public Square's southwest quadrant transformed into Stuttgart, Germany for filming.[109] Principal photography concluded in New York City, where filming took place over a span of two days.[110] Filming locations included Park Avenue and Central Park.[111][112] To capture scenes set in Manhattan, visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison spent over three days shooting aerial footage to use as background plates. Morrison emphasized the importance of incorporating real imagery into the effects work to enhance realism, stating, \"There is no substitute for starting with a real image and adding what you need.\"[113]\n\nCinematographer Seamus McGarvey explained that he chose a 1.85:1 aspect ratio to accommodate the varying heights of the main characters. He said, \"Shooting 1.85:1 is kind of unusual for an epic film like this, but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk, Captain America and Black Widow, who is much smaller. We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame. Also, Joss [Whedon] knew the final battle sequence was going to be this extravaganza in Manhattan, so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important.\" This film marked McGarvey's first experience using a digital camera, specifically the Arri Alexa.[114] Additionally, the Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Canon EOS 7D digital SLR cameras were employed for certain shots,[115][116][117] while high-speed shots were captured on 35 mm film using the Arriflex 435. McGarvey emphasized a visual approach focused on immersion and naturalism, stating, \"Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image. We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a 'comic book look' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film. We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam, cranes and on dollies to create kinetic images; and we chose angles that were dramatic, like low angles for heroic imagery.\"[114]\n\nIn December 2011, Disney announced the film would undergo a conversion to 3D.[118] According to Whedon, \"I'm not a big fan of extreme long lens, talky movies – I like to see the space I'm in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years.\" Whedon also noted, \"there definitely are movies that shouldn't be in 3D\", but stated, \"The Avengers isn't obnoxiously 3D. There's no, 'Oh look, we're going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it's in 3D!' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it's an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway.\"[119] In January 2012, it was reported that the film would undergo digital remastering for IMAX 3D and would open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day as its regular theater release. This IMAX release followed Marvel's earlier IMAX releases of Iron Man 2 and Thor.[120] Initially, when the film was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America's rating board, it received an R rating due to Phil Coulson's death scene. The scene was subsequently edited to secure a PG-13 rating.[121]\n\nIn a May 2012 interview, Whedon revealed that it was his decision to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, even though the character is not identified in the film. \"He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He's the great grand daddy of the badasses and he's in love with Death and I just think that's so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers [comic book] was Avengers Annual #7 (1977) that Jim Starlin did followed by Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2 (1977) that contained the death of Adam Warlock. Those were some of the most important texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki's work and I was like 'It's got to be Thanos.' And they said 'Okay' and I'm like 'Oh my God!'\"[122] Additionally, an extra scene featuring the Avengers enjoying shawarma was filmed on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw during the scene to conceal the beard he had grown.[123] Following the film's release, shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly saw a significant surge.[124][125][126] Whedon explained that the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the aftermath of filming a scene in the Angel episode \"A Hole in the World\" where Fred dies in Wesley's arms. After filming, Whedon, along with actors Amy Acker and Denisof, who played Fred and Wesley respectively, \"went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events\", an experience that Whedon recreated in the film's scene.[127]\n\nThe film features over 2,200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies: Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Weta Digital, Scanline VFX, Hydraulx, Fuel VFX, Evil Eye Pictures, Luma Pictures, Cantina Creative, Trixter, Modus FX, Whiskytree, Digital Domain, The Third Floor, and Method Design. ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the film's key effects, including the Helicarrier, the New York cityscape, digital body doubles, Iron Man, and the Hulk. To bring the Hulk to life on screen, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set alongside the other actors, while four motion-capture HD cameras (two capturing his full body and two focused on his face) recorded his facial and body movements.[129] Jeff White, ILM's visual effects supervisor, aimed for a more realistic depiction of the Hulk compared to the one seen in Ang Lee's 2003 film, stating, \"We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.\"[130]\n\nILM digitally recreated the majority of the New York cityscape featured in the film, covering approximately ten city blocks by four city blocks. To accomplish this, ILM dispatched a team of four photographers for an eight-week shoot to capture images of the area.[129] Tyson Bidner, the New York location manager for the film, played a crucial role in securing the rights to nearly every building's likeness needed by ILM.[58] Initially, there were plans to include OsCorp Tower from The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) in the film, as Disney and Sony Pictures had agreed to it. However, this idea was abandoned because much of the skyline had already been finalized.[131] Weta Digital assumed responsibility for animating Iron Man during the forest duel, taking over from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, explained, \"We shared assets back and forth with ILM, but our pipelines are unique and it's hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different.\"[130] Williams highlighted that the most challenging aspect was reproducing Iron Man's reflective metal surfaces.[129]\n\nScanline VFX handled the reveal shots of the Helicarrier, from Black Widow and Captain America's arrival on the carrier deck to its lift-off. Evil Eye Pictures integrated digital backgrounds into greenscreen footage for scenes set inside the Helicarrier. Colin Strause from Hydraulx mentioned their contribution, stating, \"We did the opening ten minutes of the movie, other than the opening set-up in space\", covering Loki's arrival on Earth and his subsequent escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. base. Luma Pictures focused on the Helicarrier's bridge shots and integrated the graphic monitor displays developed by Cantina Creative. Fuel VFX handled shots in and around Tony Stark's penthouse at Stark Tower. Digital Domain crafted the asteroid environment where Loki encounters The Other.[129] Method Design, based in Los Angeles, was responsible for the film's closing credits. Steve Viola, creative director at Method Design, described it as \"a two-minute, self-contained main on end sequence created entirely in CG\". He explained that they designed, modeled, textured, and lit all environments and many foreground objects for each shot. Assets from Marvel were modified extensively to create a post-battle macro sequence. Method Design also crafted a custom typeface for the main title of The Avengers as well as 30 in-scene credits.[130]\n\nIn November 2011, Marvel announced that Alan Silvestri, who scored Captain America: The First Avenger, would compose the score for The Avengers. Silvestri commented on the challenge of the project, stating, \"I've worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together.\"[132] Silvestri collaborated with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England to develop the score.[133] Whedon praised Silvestri's approach, stating, \"The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [Silvestri] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the [Hans Zimmer] school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love.\"[133]\n\nIn March 2012, the Indian rock band Agnee released a music video for their single \"Hello Andheron\", serving as the theme song for the Indian release of the film.[134] Hollywood Records released the soundtrack concept album inspired by the film, titled Avengers Assemble, on May 1, 2012, coinciding with the release of the score.[135]\n\nThe film was promoted at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con, featuring a teaser trailer narrated by Samuel L. Jackson followed by an introduction of the cast.[40] In June 2011, Marvel Studios announced that it would not hold a panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, as studio executives felt unprepared to meet their own past achievements and fan expectations with filming still in production.[136] Subsequently, in July 2011, a teaser trailer intended as the post-credits scene of Captain America: The First Avenger briefly leaked online. Entertainment Weekly speculated that it originated from a preview screening, describing the footage as \"shaky, fuzzy, flickering, and obviously filmed on a cell phone\".[137]\n\nIn August 2011, Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios, and Marvel Studios presented a look at Walt Disney Studios' upcoming film slate, which included The Avengers, at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, California. The presentation featured footage from the film and appearances by the cast members.[138] Later in August, Disney dismissed Marvel's executive vice president of worldwide marketing, vice president of worldwide marketing, and manager of worldwide marketing to bring their functions in-house.[139]\n\nIn October 2011, Marvel Studios held a presentation at the New York Comic Con featuring new footage and a panel discussion including producer Kevin Feige and several cast members.[140] The first full-length trailer was also released in October. Comic Book Resources noted, \"The two-minute teaser handily establishes the movie's premise\" and is \"heavy on the assembling, but fans are also treated to plenty of action, as well glimpses  [sic] of Iron Man's new armor and, best of all, the new take on the Incredible Hulk. Naturally, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark gets the best lines\".[141] However, The Hollywood Reporter called it, \"Awesome. Or it would be if we hadn't seen all of this before and expected every single thing that we saw in the trailer\".[142] The trailer, which debuted exclusively on iTunes Movie Trailers, was downloaded over 10 million times in its first 24 hours, breaking the website's record for the most-viewed trailer.[143] This record was surpassed by the trailer for The Dark Knight Rises (2012), which was downloaded more than 12.5 million times in its first 24 hours.[144] A second full-length trailer was released on iTunes in February 2012, reaching a record 13.7 million downloads in 24 hours.[145] The theatrical trailers of The Avengers appeared with many films, including Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011), 21 Jump Street (2012), and The Hunger Games (2012).[146]\n\nIn January 2012, Marvel Studios hosted a global Twitter chat. The 30-minute live tweeting event featured writer/director Joss Whedon and cast members Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg, along with a 10-second tease of the 30-second commercial that would air during Super Bowl XLVI in February.[147] According to the Los Angeles Times, Disney paid an estimated $4 million for the 30-second spot.[148] On May 1, 2012, executives from Marvel Studios, along with actors Tom Hiddleston and Clark Gregg, rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange in honor of the film's theatrical release.[149]\n\nIn December 2011, Marvel announced the release of an eight-issue comic-book prelude to the film, penned by Christopher Yost and Eric Pearson with art by Luke Ross and Daniel HDR, for release in March 2012.[150] In February 2012, Marvel revealed plans for a second limited series comic book tie-in titled Black Widow Strikes, written by Fred Van Lente, who wrote Captain America: First Vengeance, the comic-book prequel to Captain America: The First Avenger. Set between Iron Man 2 and The Avengers, it follows Black Widow as she ties up loose ends from the former film.[151] Additionally, the title Avengers Assemble debuted in March 2012, written by Brian Michael Bendis with art by Mark Bagley, featuring the same Avengers lineup as the film in a battle against a new incarnation of the supervillain team Zodiac.[152]\n\nPaul Gitter, president of consumer products at Marvel Entertainment, noted that the anticipation leading up to the film bolstered retail partnerships: \"Retailers have been less tolerant with [intellectual property] films, so we decided that if we started on this coordinated strategy several years ago, retailers would give us shelf space throughout the years and we would have a more sustainable position in the marketplace.\"[153]\n\nIn September 2011, photos emerged online showing Robert Downey Jr. driving a new model Acura. An Acura spokesperson later confirmed the company's involvement with the film, stating, \"As you may know, Acura has been in the Marvel Comics Universe films as the official car of their fictional law enforcement agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. That relationship continues for The Avengers. The open-top sports car that was photographed yesterday is a one-off, fictional car that was made just for the movie and will not be produced. That said, as you may also know, our CEO has said publicly that we are studying the development of a new sportscar, but we can't say any more about it at this time.\"[154] In December 2011, Acura announced that a new NSX, styled along the lines of the concept built for The Avengers, would be unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show.[155] Additionally, a series of 10 S.H.I.E.L.D. SUVs, based on the Acura MDX with modifications by Cinema Vehicle Services, were also created for the film.[156]\n\nIn February 2012, Marvel announced a partnership with fragrance company JADS to promote The Avengers with character-based fragrances. The announcement preceded the Toy Industry Association's annual February exhibition, where representatives showcased the products at a sampling booth.[157] Other promotional partners included bracelet-maker Colantotte, Dr Pepper, Farmers Insurance, Harley-Davidson, Hershey, Land O'Frost lunchmeats, Oracle, Red Baron pizza, Symantec, Visa, and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. Marvel and its parent company Disney secured an estimated $100 million in worldwide marketing support for the film. Notably absent from the promotional lineup were Baskin-Robbins, Burger King, and Dunkin' Donuts, which had partnered with Marvel in the past when their films were distributed by Paramount; Disney generally avoids promotions through fast food outlets.[158]\n\nA video game based on the film was initially planned for simultaneous release. It was intended to be a combination of a first-person shooter and a brawler for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Microsoft Windows platforms, with THQ as the publisher. The console versions were to be developed by THQ Studio Australia, while Blue Tongue Entertainment was tasked with creating the PC version. However, after THQ shut down both studios, the game was ultimately canceled.[159] Consequently, the intellectual property rights for an Avengers video game reverted to Marvel, which stated that it was exploring potential publishing and licensing opportunities.[160]\n\nIn May 2012, a collaboration between Ubisoft and Marvel Entertainment was revealed, unveiling their joint project: a motion-controlled game titled Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth designed for the Wii U and Xbox 360 Kinect. Inspired by the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline, the game showcases 20 different characters.[161] Additionally, Marvel announced the development of a four-chapter mobile game titled Avengers Initiative, with each chapter dedicated to exploring the adventures of Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man.[162]\n\nIn February 2012, Disney announced a title change for the film in the United Kingdom to avoid confusion with the British TV series of the same name and its 1998 film adaptation. This caused uncertainty over the film's actual title. Empire magazine reported that the film would be titled Marvel Avengers Assemble,[163] while The Hollywood Reporter said that it would be called simply Avengers Assemble.[164] Marvel's UK website referred to it as Marvel's Avengers Assemble,[165] though David Cox of The Guardian, in arguing that it was one of the worst film titles ever, considered this a production notes error.[166] The British Board of Film Classification and the Irish Film Classification Office listed it as Marvel Avengers Assemble.[1][6] Frank Lovece in FilmFestivalTraveler.com noted the discrepancy, observing that the film is formally titled \"Marvel's The Avengers\" on screen, despite the absence of an apostrophe on posters.[5] Feige explained the UK title's additional word, emphasizing the thorough decision-making process involved.[167]\n\nThe film's world premiere took place on April 11, 2012, at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre.[168] It closed the 11th Annual Tribeca Film Festival with a screening on April 28.[169] For the 2012 U.S. Labor Day weekend, the film received an expanded one-week theatrical push, increasing the number of theaters from 123 to 1,700.[170] The Avengers was the last film released in Phase One of the MCU.[171]\n\nThe film was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment[172][173] on Blu-ray Disc, Blu-ray 3D, DVD, and digital download on September 25 in the United States and as early as August 29 in various international markets.[174][175] Feige mentioned that the Blu-ray version features a new Marvel One-Shot titled Item 47 (2012), along with \"a number of deleted scenes and a few storylines that fell by the wayside during the editing process\". These include \"a few more scenes with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill, played by Cobie Smulders\", and \"some slightly different versions of Maria Hill and Nick Fury's interaction with the World Security Council\".[176]\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One – Avengers Assembled\", which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[177] This box set was released on April 2, 2013.[178][179] Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment subsequently released the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on August 14, 2018.[180]\n\nSome fans have criticized the UK DVD and Blu-ray release for omitting Joss Whedon's audio commentary and altering the scene involving Phil Coulson's death from the film's theatrical version.[181] Disney's UK division stated that the \"less graphic depiction of Agent Coulson's confrontation with Loki\" occurred because \"[e]ach country has its own compliance issues relative to depictions of violence. Unfortunately, another region's elements were inadvertently used to create the UK in-home release\".[181]\n\nUpon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart. It garnered 72% of unit sales from Blu-ray, setting a record for a new release in which both the DVD and Blu-ray formats were released simultaneously.[173]\n\nIn July 2024, a Lakota language dub of the film became available on Disney+. Downey, Evans, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Johansson, and Renner reprised their roles to re-record their lines, with the project spear-headed by Ruffalo. Ruffalo had a previous relationship with the Lakota people and was looking to help further the Lakota's efforts to help revitalize their language.[182]\n\nThe Avengers grossed $623.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $895.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.519 billion,[4] making it the third-highest-grossing film of all time,[183] the highest-grossing film of 2012, the highest-grossing comic book adaptation, the highest-grossing superhero film, and the highest-grossing film ever released by Walt Disney Studios, at the time of its release.[184] The film's worldwide opening of $392.5 million ranked as the fourth-largest.[185] The Avengers also became the fifth film distributed by Disney and the twelfth film overall to earn more than $1 billion. It reached this milestone in 19 days, matching the record previously set by Avatar (2009) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011).[186][187][188] Its grosses exceeded its estimated $220 million production cost 12 days after its release.[189] It was the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales.[190]\n\nThe film became the third-highest-grossing film of all time,[183][191] the highest-grossing film of 2012,[192] the highest-grossing film distributed by Disney,[193][194] the highest-grossing superhero film, and the highest-grossing film based on comics.[4] It opened Friday, May 4, 2012, on around 11,800 screens across 4,349 theaters, earning $80.8 million, marking the second-biggest opening and second-biggest single-day gross.[195][196] The film's Friday gross included an $18.7 million midnight run, a record for a superhero film[197][198] Without midnight grosses, the film earned the largest opening-day gross ($62.1 million).[199][200] It also set records for Saturday and Sunday grosses ($69.6 million and $57.1 million, respectively).[201][202][203] In total, it earned $207,438,708 for its debut weekend, setting an opening-weekend record,[204] including an IMAX opening-weekend record of $15.3 million[205][206][207] and a record for opening-weekend grosses originating from 3D showings ($108 million).[203][208] The opening-weekend audience was evenly split between those under and over the age of 25, with 60% male, 55% couples, 24% families, and 21% teenagers.[209] Earning $103.1 million on its second weekend, the film set a record for the largest second-weekend gross.[210] Other records set by the film include the biggest weekend per-theater average for a wide release ($47,698 per theater),[211] the fastest film to reach $100 million and each additional $50 million through $550 million,[210][212][213] and the largest cumulative gross through every day of release until, and including, its forty-third day (with the exception of its first day).[4][214] It remained in first place at the box office for three consecutive weekends.[215] The film set a record for the highest monthly share, with its $532.5 million total (through May 31, 2012) accounting for 52% of the total earnings at the box office during May.[216]\n\nThe film set the following records upon its theatrical release.\n\n*  By the end of its second day, the film's gross exceeded that of all eight films that had reached $100 million after two days.\n\nThe film became the third-highest-grossing film of all time,[226] the highest-grossing Disney-distributed film,[227] the highest-grossing film of 2012,[228] and the highest-grossing superhero film.[187] It opened on Wednesday, April 25, 2012, in 10 countries, earning $17.1 million.[229] It expanded to 29 more countries on April 26 and 27, grossing $73.1 million in three days.[230] By Sunday, April 29, it had amassed an opening-weekend total of $185.1 million from 39 countries.[231] It maintained its first-place position at the box office for four consecutive weekends.[232][233][234] The film set opening-day records in New Zealand, Malaysia, and Iceland, as well as single-day records in the Philippines. It also achieved both single- and opening-day records in Singapore and Thailand. Additionally, it earned the second-highest-grossing opening day in Australia ($6.2 million), Mexico, the Philippines, and Vietnam.[146][229][230][235][236] Furthermore, it established opening-weekend records in numerous territories, including Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Taiwan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Peru, and Central America.[231][237][238][239][240] It also secured the second-largest five-day opening in Australia ($20.2 million).[231][241]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film earned £2.5 million ($4.1 million) on its opening day[242] and £15.8 million ($25.7 million) over the weekend,[243] setting a new opening-weekend record for a superhero film.[236][244][245] It emerged as the market's highest-grossing superhero film.[246][247] In Latin America, it set records as the highest-grossing film ($207 million)[248] and the first film to surpass $200 million.[249] It also claimed the top spot as the highest-grossing film in the Philippines, Singapore, and Indonesia.[250][251] As of February 2021[update], the film's leading international markets were China ($83 million), United Kingdom ($80.5 million), Brazil ($63.9 million), Mexico ($61.7 million), and Australia ($54.5 million).[3]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 91%, with an average score of 8.1/10, based on 368 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Thanks to a script that emphasizes its heroes' humanity and a wealth of superpowered set pieces, The Avengers lives up to its hype and raises the bar for Marvel at the movies.\"[252] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100 based on 43 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[253] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an \"A+ to F\" scale.[254]\n\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review of the film, remarking, \"It's clamorous, the save-the-world story is one everyone's seen time and again, and the characters have been around for more than half a century in 500 comic book issues. But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again.\"[255] To Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. \"It's also the blockbuster,\" Travers said, \"I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's Transformers with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor.\"[256] Justin Chang of Variety wrote, \"Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty, and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story.\"[257] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times complimented the film's frenetic pace,[258] while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times commented that it \"provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable\".[259] Conversely, A. O. Scott of The New York Times believed that \"while The Avengers is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.\"[260]\n\nThe performances of several cast members were a frequent topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; stating, \"Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano.\"[261] Similarly, The New Yorker's Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights—alongside Downey.[262] The Village Voice's Karina Longworth concluded: \"Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself.\"[263] Travers asserted that the actor resonated a \"scruffy warmth and humor\" vibe,[256] while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character.[258] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that \"the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses.)\"[264]\n\nReferring to Downey, Joe Morgenstein of The Wall Street Journal—despite complimenting Downey's performance—favored his work in Iron Man over his acting in The Avengers: \"His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication—the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world—and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony.\"[265] Neumaier praised Evans, stating that he accurately conveyed his character's internal conflicts.[261]\n\nCommentators appreciated the character development and dialogue. Associated Press reviewer Christy Lemire wrote that the script \"sparkles as brightly as the special effects; these people may be wearing ridiculous costumes but they're well fleshed-out underneath.\"[266] Scott suggested that certain parts of the film exuded a charm reminiscent of the western film Rio Bravo (1959).[260] Longworth felt that while Whedon's script delved into the backstory of the characters, the film did not explore it \"in a substantive way\".[263]\n\nAt the 85th Academy Awards, The Avengers received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[267] The film's other nominations include two Annie Awards (winning one),[268] a British Academy Film Award,[269] and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards.[270][271] In 2017, it was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in Empire magazine's poll of The 100 Greatest Movies.[272]\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron[273] was written and directed by Whedon,[274] and released on May 1, 2015.[275] The film features much of the original cast, alongside new additions including Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver, Paul Bettany as Vision, and James Spader as Ultron.[276] Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.[277][278][279] Infinity War was released on April 27, 2018,[280] followed by Endgame on April 26, 2019.[279] The ensemble cast for both films includes returning actors from previous MCU entries, as well as new characters from other films in the franchise.[281]\n"

        "content": "\n\nIron Man 3 is a 2013 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Iron Man, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.[a] It is the sequel to Iron Man (2008) and Iron Man 2 (2010), and the seventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Shane Black from a screenplay he co-wrote with Drew Pearce, and stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Rebecca Hall, Stéphanie Szostak, James Badge Dale, William Sadler, Miguel Ferrer, Jon Favreau, and Ben Kingsley. In the film, Stark grapples with the consequences of the events of The Avengers (2012) during a national terrorism campaign on the United States led by the mysterious Mandarin.\n\nAfter the release of Iron Man 2 in May 2010, director Jon Favreau chose not to return for a third film. Black was hired to write and direct the sequel in February 2011, working with Pearce to make the script more character-centric, focus on thriller elements, and use concepts from Warren Ellis's \"Extremis\" comic book story arc. The film's supporting cast, including Kingsley, Pearce, and Hall, were brought on throughout April and May 2012. Filming took place from May 23 to December 17, 2012, primarily at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. Additional filming took place around North Carolina as well as in Florida, Los Angeles, and China; an extended version of the film specifically for Chinese audiences was created. Seventeen companies provided the film's visual effects.\n\nIron Man 3 premiered at the Grand Rex in Paris on April 14, 2013, and was released in the United States on May 3, as the first film in Phase Two of the MCU. It received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its action sequences, Black's direction, and Downey's performance, though there was criticism for the portrayal of the Mandarin. The film was a box office success, grossing over $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 2013 and the sixteenth film to gross over $1 billion. It finished its theatrical run as the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time, while its opening weekend was the sixth-highest of all time. The film received Best Visual Effects nominations at the Academy Awards and the BAFTA Awards.\n\nAt a New Year's Eve party in 1999, Tony Stark meets scientist Maya Hansen, the inventor of Extremis, an experimental regenerative treatment that allows recovery from crippling injuries. Disabled scientist Aldrich Killian offers them a place in his company Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.), but Stark rejects him. Thirteen years later, Stark is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and has frequent panic attacks due to his experiences during the alien invasion of New York.[b] He has built dozens of new Iron Man suits to cope with his insomnia, creating friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts.\n\nMeanwhile, a string of bombings is claimed by a terrorist known as the Mandarin. Stark's security chief Happy Hogan is badly injured in one such attack and is put into a coma, prompting Stark to issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, revealing his home address in the process. The Mandarin sends gunship helicopters to destroy Stark's home. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack with Potts. Stark escapes in an experimental new Iron Man suit, which his artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's new armor is not fully functional and lacks sufficient power to return to Malibu, leading the world to believe that he died.\n\nWith the help of Harley Keener, a local boy, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack, although it occurred years before any known attack by the terrorist. He discovers the \"bombings\" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis whose bodies explosively rejected the treatment, and were falsely attributed by A.I.M. as a terrorist plot to cover up Extremis' flaws. Stark witnesses Extremis firsthand when Mandarin agents Savin and Brandt attack him. Stark kills Brandt and incapacitates Savin. Meanwhile, Killian resurfaces and kidnaps Potts with assistance from Hansen. American intelligence agencies continue to search for the Mandarin, with James Rhodes—the former War Machine, now re-branded as the Iron Patriot—lured into a trap to steal his armor.\n\nTracing the Mandarin to Miami, Stark infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside, he discovers the Mandarin is an English actor named Trevor Slattery, who is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian then captures Stark. He reveals he has subjected Potts to Extremis in the hope Stark will help fix Extremis' flaws while trying to save her. When Hansen betrays Killian by threatening to jeopardize his operations, Killian kills her.\n\nStark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard Air Force One, using the Iron Patriot armor, controlled by Savin. Stark kills Savin, saving the passengers and crew, but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis. At an impounded damaged oil tanker, Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President would then become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders, in exchange for Extremis curing his young daughter's disability. Stark and Rhodes infiltrate the platform, aided by the Iron Man suits, remotely controlled by J.A.R.V.I.S.. Rhodes secures the President and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure. Before he can save her, a rig collapses around them, and she falls to the platform to her apparent death. Stark fights Killian but finds himself cornered. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin behind Slattery's cover. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive the fall, kills Killian to save Stark.\n\nAs a gesture of his devotion to Potts, Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to destroy all the Iron Man suits. The Vice President and Slattery are arrested, and Happy awakens from his coma. With Stark's help, Potts's Extremis effects are stabilized. Stark promises to scale back his life as Iron Man, undergoing surgery to remove the shrapnel near his heart and throwing his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea. He muses that, even without the technology, he will always be Iron Man.\n\nPaul Bettany reprises his role from previous films as J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark's AI system.[26] Ty Simpkins portrays Harley Keener, a child who lives in Rose Hill, Tennessee, who assists Stark when the latter breaks into his garage in order to repair his suit. He later helps Stark investigate various incidents associated with the Extremis project, and afterwards he is rewarded by Stark with a garage-full of modern engineering tools and equipment.[41][26] Simpkins reprises his role as Harley in a cameo appearance in Avengers: Endgame (2019). Simpkins has stated that he has a three-picture deal with Marvel Studios.[42] Ashley Hamilton portrays Taggart, one of the Extremis soldiers.[43] Adam Pally plays Gary, a cameraman who helps Stark.[44] Shaun Toub reprises his role as Yinsen from the first Iron Man (2008) film in a brief cameo,[45] and Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance as a beauty pageant judge.[46] Dale Dickey plays Mrs. Davis, mother of an Extremis subject that is framed as a terrorist.[47] Wang Xueqi briefly plays Dr. Wu in the general release version of the film.[48] A cut of the film produced for release exclusively in China includes additional scenes featuring Wang and an appearance by Fan Bingbing as one of his assistants.[49][50] Jenna Ortega plays the vice president's daughter.[51] Mark Ruffalo makes an uncredited cameo appearance, reprising his role as Bruce Banner from The Avengers, in a post-credits scene.[52] Comedians Bill Maher and Joan Rivers,[53][54] and Fashion Police (2010-2017) co-host George Kotsiopoulos have cameo appearances as themselves on their respective real-world television programs,[55] as do newscasters Josh Elliott,[56] Megan Henderson,[57] Pat Kiernan,[58] and Thomas Roberts.[59]\n\nTruthfully, the way to go about doing a part 3, if you're ever in that position, as I'm lucky enough to be, is to find a way that the first two weren't done yet. You have to find a way to make sure that the story that's emerging is still ongoing and, by the time you've finished 3, will be something resembling the culmination of a trilogy. It's about, 'How has the story not yet been completely told?,' and I think we're getting there. I think we've really found ways to make this feel organic and new, based on what's come before, and that's what I'm happy about.\n\nFollowing the release of Iron Man 2 (2010), a conflict between Paramount Pictures, which had distribution rights to certain Marvel Comics properties, and The Walt Disney Company, Marvel Entertainment's then new corporate parent, clouded the timing and the distribution arrangement of a possible third film.[60] On October 18, 2010, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115 million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3,[61] with Disney, Marvel, and Paramount announcing a May 3, 2013, release date for the film.[62]\n\nIron Man (2008) and Iron Man 2 director Jon Favreau said in December 2010 that he would not direct Iron Man 3, opting to direct Magic Kingdom instead. He remained an executive producer of director Joss Whedon's crossover film The Avengers (2012) and also served as an executive producer of Iron Man 3.[63][64] Also in 2010, Downey reached out to Shane Black, who directed him in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), to write and direct the film.[65] In February 2011, Black entered final negotiations to join the project,[66][67] and in March it was announced that Drew Pearce, who Marvel had originally hired for a Runaways script, would work with Black on the script.[68] Downey said, \"Bringing in Shane Black to write and direct Iron Man 3 to me is basically the only transition from Favreau to a 'next thing' that Favreau and the audience and Marvel and I could ever actually sign off on.\"[9] Black was initially hesitant to work with Pearce on the film, preferring to work with a writing partner of his own, but after a week of discussing the film and getting to know one another, agreed to write the film with Pearce.[69]: 207 \n\nBlack described his take on the film as not being \"two men in iron suits fighting each other,\" and more like a \"Tom Clancy thriller\", with Iron Man fighting real-world type villains.[67] Pearce added that they would avoid magic and space, with Iron Man 3 being \"a techno-thriller set in a more real world than even The Avengers\". The duo spent some time discussing themes and images and ideas before starting the script.[11] While writing, the focus was to avoid scenes of pure exposition, making every moment propel other narrative points forward. Some elements from the comics were used even if in different connotations, such as making Rhodes wear Norman Osborn's Iron Patriot armor and naming some characters with names from unrelated people in the Marvel Universe, such as Eric Savin and Jack Taggart.[28]\n\nThe film's plot is influenced primarily by the \"Extremis\" (2005-2006) comics storyline, written by Warren Ellis.[33] The first two acts would remain character-centric, albeit in Black's words \"more hectic, frenetic, and large scale\" to fulfill its sequel obligations, with the third act going for more over-the-top action to what Pearce described as \"giving a sense of opera\". The middle act was compared to Sullivan's Travels (1941) in having Tony meeting various people on his journey, and the writers made sure to not make the characters too similar. The initial draft had Maya Hansen herself leading the villainous operation, with the Mandarin and Killian emerging as antagonists in later versions of the script. During one of the writing sessions, Pearce suggested that the Mandarin was a fake, and Black agreed by going with making him an actor, which in turn Pearce detailed as an overacting British stage performer. Black explained: \"Who would be fool enough to declare that he is an international terrorist? If you're smart, whatever regime you're part of, you'd put a puppet committee and remain your house\". In turn Killian would hide Trevor Slattery in \"his own frat house, in kind of a drug-related house arrest\" to keep the secret alive.[28]\n\nAccording to Black, the reveal of the actual villain being Hansen was \"like Remington Steele (1982-1987), you think it's the man but at the end, the woman has been running the whole show.\" The role was eventually shifted to Killian because of objections by Marvel Entertainment executives, who were concerned with apparent merchandising losses that could come with having a female villain. The roles of several other major female characters were also made smaller in the final film compared to earlier drafts.[70]\n\nBoth the opening and the ending of the film were reworked in various ways. First it would begin with a flashback to Tony's childhood. Then like Iron Man it would begin in medias res, with Tony crashing in Tennessee before a voice-over that would lead to how he got there, until it got changed to the final version. For the climactic tanker battle, it was originally considered that Brandt would show up in the James Bond tradition of the henchman coming back for the heroes. Instead they chose to use Killian himself, and have Pepper, whom he abused earlier, cause his downfall as a way of poetic justice. The final dialogue was originally written as \"I am Tony Stark\" to be a response to the first film's ending, but eventually it changed to \"I am Iron Man\" to enhance the mythical qualities.[28] On setting the film around Christmas, Black said \"I think it's a sense of if you're doing something on an interesting scale that involves an entire universe of characters, one way to unite them is to have them all undergo a common experience. There's something at Christmas that unites everybody and it already sets a stage within the stage, that wherever you are, you're experiencing this world together. I think that also there's something just pleasing about it to me.\" Pearce added that he would have wanted to see a third Iron Man film set at Christmas, adding that \"when you're telling a story about taking characters apart, it almost has more resonance if you put it at Christmas and if you're also telling a story about lonelier characters as well. That loneliness is heightened at Christmas\". Black also felt the character Harley Keener embodied the Ghost of Christmas Past for Stark.[71]\n\nIn September 2011, Marvel Studios reached an agreement to shoot the film primarily out of EUE/Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. Michigan was also in contention to land the production, but the Michigan Film Office could not match North Carolina's tax incentives.[72] In April 2012, Ben Kingsley entered into negotiations to play a villain in Iron Man 3,[73] a part which Anthony Mackie, who would later portray Sam Wilson in the MCU, also auditioned for.[74] The following week, producer Kevin Feige revealed that Iron Man 3 would begin shooting in North Carolina \"in five weeks,\" and said that it \"is a full-on Tony Stark-centric movie ... very much inspired by the first half of Iron Man ... [H]e's stripped of everything, he's backed up against a wall, and he's gotta use his intelligence to get out of it. He can't call Thor, he can't call Cap, he can't call Nick Fury, and he can't look for the Helicarrier in the sky.\"[75] A few days later, The Walt Disney Company China, Marvel Studios, and DMG Entertainment announced an agreement to co-produce Iron Man 3 in China. DMG partly financed, produced in China with Marvel, and handled co-production matters. DMG also distributed the film in China in tandem with Disney.[76][77] DMG had been pitching Marvel Studios on collaboration opportunities to enhance the film for the Chinese market. Initially, they suggested that Harley Keener be a Chinese exchange student, something Marvel Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito shot down since they did not want the film to feature \"the sidekick from Indiana Jones [and the Temple of Doom]\" (1984). Instead, Feige suggested a doctor named Doctor Wu (in reference to the Steely Dan song) who could remove the shrapnel from Stark's chest.[69]: 210  Chinese star Andy Lau became involved in negotiations to join the film in that role.[78] Lau would later turn down the role, and Wang Xueqi was cast instead.[79][48]\n\nThe next week, Guy Pearce entered into final talks to play Aldrich Killian, a character who is featured in the \"Extremis\" comic book story arc.[18] Jessica Chastain entered into discussions for a role in the film,[80] but bowed out due to scheduling conflicts.[22] In May, Rebecca Hall was cast in her place,[22] and her role was described as \"a scientist who plays a pivotal role in the creation of a nanotechnology, known as Extremis\".[23] Over the next few weeks, James Badge Dale was cast as Eric Savin,[29] Ashley Hamilton was cast as Firepower,[43] and Favreau returned to reprise his role as Happy Hogan from the first two films.[81] Stéphanie Szostak and William Sadler were also cast in the film, with Sadler playing the President of the United States.[32][82] Despite erroneous early reports that Cobie Smulders would reprise her role as Maria Hill from The Avengers in the film,[83] Smulders wrote on her verified Twitter page that this was not so.[84] According to Drew Pearce, Emilia Clarke was initially cast for an unknown role, before the script was changed.[85]\n\nFilming began in Wilmington, North Carolina, on May 23, 2012, at EUE/Screen Gems Studios,[86] with the working title Caged Heat.[87] Cinematographer John Toll opted to work with digital cameras for the first time in his career, as he found them more convenient for a visual effects-heavy production. Toll shot the film primarily on the Arri Alexa camera.[88] From June 4 through June 6, 2012, filming took place in Cary, North Carolina, at the Epic Games headquarters[89] and SAS Institute,[90] with a large Christmas tree set up on the front lawn.[91] A scene was also shot at the Wilmington International Airport.[86] The Port of Wilmington served as a location for the oil tanker in the climactic battle, along with a soundstage recreation of the dock.[28] The crumbling house itself was filmed in a hydraulic-powered giubo platform that could bend and split into two pieces. All the interior footage had practical effects, including debris and explosions, with computer graphics used only to add exteriors and Iron Man's armor.[92][93]\n\nFrom July 19 to August 1, 2012, filming took place on Oak Island, North Carolina, to \"film aerial drops over the Atlantic Ocean.\"[94] They were done for the scene where Iron Man rescues the people falling from the Air Force One over Miami, which were originally envisioned done with green screen effects, but were changed to using actual skydivers as second unit director Brian Smrz knew the Red Bull skydiving team. Computer graphics were employed only to add clouds, the destroyed plane and matte paintings of the Florida coastline in the background, replace a stand-in with the Iron Man armor, and some digital compositing to combine different takes of the skydivers together.[95] Filming took place in Rose Hill, North Carolina, in early August 2012,[96] and the town's name was incorporated into the script as the Tennessee city Stark visits.[93] On August 14, actress Dale Dickey said she had been cast in the film, and was currently shooting her scenes.[47] The following day, production was halted when Downey suffered an ankle injury.[97] During the break, Black and Pearce made more script revisions before shooting resumed by August 24.[98][99]\n\nCast and crew began arriving in Florida on October 1, to shoot scenes on Dania Beach and around South Florida.[100] That same day, Downey returned to the set after his ankle injury.[101] In early October, scenes were shot at a replica of the Malibu restaurant Neptune's Net,[102] and filming took place on location at the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens.[103] Scenes were shot during the daytime inside the Miami Beach Resort at Miami Beach on October 10 and 11.[104] The production returned to Wilmington in mid-October for additional filming.[105] On November 1, scenes were shot at the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens.[106] Filming in the United States wrapped on November 7 in Wilmington.[107]\n\nFilming began in Beijing, China on December 10. Filming was scheduled to wrap a week later on December 17, 2012.[48] The China filming did not include the main cast and crew.[107] In January 2013, it was reported that a film crew led by Shane Black would begin location scouting in Hyderabad and Bengaluru, India between January 20 and 24.[108] Also in January, Cheadle confirmed that re-shooting was taking place in Manhattan Beach.[109] Shooting also took place on the week of January 23, 2013, at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.[110] A major part of the content filmed in the reshoots regarded the Mandarin, with Drew Pearce saying that in early cuts, the character \"didn't feel real enough—there wasn't a sense of him being [part of] the real world, mostly because he was just looking down a lens and threatening the world.\"[11] A report on actual production costs for films from FilmL.A. Inc., indicated a gross budget of $200 million, with a net of $178.4 million for Iron Man 3 after tax incentives from North Carolina and Florida.[2]\n\nChris Townsend served as visual effects supervisor for the film, which featured over 2,000 visual effects shots and was worked on by 17 studios, including Weta Digital, Digital Domain, Scanline VFX, Trixter, Framestore, Luma Pictures, Fuel VFX, Cantina Creative, Cinesite, The Embassy Visual Effects, Lola Visual Effects, Capital T, Prologue and Rise FX.[92] Townsend said that from January 2013 through the end of filming in April, the collective crew had one day of downtime, otherwise working seven days a week and 14 to 18 hours a day.[111]\n\nDigital Domain, Scanline VFX and Trixter each worked on separate shots featuring the Mark 42 armor, working with different digital models. The studios shared some of their files to ensure consistency between the shots. For the Mark 42 and Iron Patriot armors, Legacy Effects constructed partial suits that were worn on set. Townsend explained that \"Invariably we'd shoot a soft-suit with Robert then we'd also put tracking markers on his trousers. He would also wear lifts in his shoes or be up in a box so he'd be the correct height—Iron Man is 6'5\". During shooting we used multiple witness cams, Canon C300s, and we had two or three running whenever there was an Iron Man or Extremis character.\" The artists studied time lapse photography of decaying fruit and vegetables and actual phenomena such as the aurora borealis as reference for the effect of the glowing Extremis characters.[92] The heads-up display features of the helmet were inspired by visualization techniques from MRI diagnostic pattern recognition and graph theory, particularly by the connectogram, a circular graph that maps all of the white-matter connections of the human brain.[112]\n\nThe film's production was delayed following Downey's leg injury, and for certain shots they were forced to create a double for Downey. Townsend explained that \"The collective VFX [supervisors] and unit leads ran into a room as soon as the incident happened to try to ascertain what sequences could they shoot.\" Certain shots were filmed with a body double on set, and Weta Digital created a digital body double for others.[111]\n\nA total of three hours and 15 minutes of footage were shot before editing, where it was brought down to 130 minutes (119 without the credits),[28] marking the longest stand-alone Iron Man film.[33] Post-production also had a 3D conversion[113] and a digital remaster for the IMAX release.[114] Todd-AO mixed the sound in Dolby Atmos to enhance the immersive experience.[115] Trevor Slattery was originally meant to die in the film, appearing during the climatic oil rig battle with an Extremis injector and promptly blowing up after taking it. Pearce said that was \"the most Monty Python of all of the beats\" in the film. During the editing process, it was determined to keep Slattery alive, with new material shot during the reshoots to accommodate this.[116]\n\nThe film is scored by Brian Tyler, who signed on in October 2012.[117] According to Tyler, he was approached more for his \"thematic\" scores such as The Greatest Game Ever Played, Annapolis, and Partition rather than his \"modern\" action scores such as The Fast and Furious films, with Kevin Feige asking for a theme that was recognizable and featured those dramatic tones.[118] To employ the \"deeply thematic component with a strong melody,\" the score employs mostly orchestra sounds. The main theme for Iron Man focuses on horns and trumpets,[119] to be \"both a march and anthem.\" Tyler mentioned that John Williams' work on Raiders of the Lost Ark was the first thing he thought of as an influence, and the cue for the Well of Souls in Raiders influenced the Extremis motif, as Tyler felt it should enhance a spiritual side for having a \"technology so advanced that nears magic.\" Echoing the Mandarin's amalgamated personality, his theme was religious music \"that borrows from many cultures,\" from \"Monastic, Gothic, and Christian chants to music from the Middle-East.\"[118] The score was recorded with the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios.[119]\n\nAlong with Tyler's soundtrack album, Hollywood Records released a concept album inspired by the film, Heroes Fall. It features twelve original alternative rock and indie rock songs, with only one appearing in the film itself, Awolnation's \"Some Kind of Joke.\"[120]\n\nIn July 2012, at San Diego Comic-Con, a new Iron Man armor from the film, the Mark XLII, was on display on the convention floor, along with the Marks I-VII from the first two Iron Man films and The Avengers.[121] A panel was held, during which Shane Black, Robert Downey Jr., Don Cheadle, Jon Favreau and Kevin Feige discussed making the film, and several minutes of footage from the film were shown.[35] The first television advertisement aired during Super Bowl XLVII on the CBS network in the United States.[122] On March 25, 2013, Marvel and Disney revealed on the official Iron Man Facebook page, \"Iron Man 3: Armor Unlock,\" to reveal suits Stark has made before the events of the film.[123] In January 2013, Marvel Comics released a two-issue comic book prelude by writers Christos Gage and Will Corona Pilgrim with art by Steve Kurth and Drew Geraci. The story set between the second and third Iron Man films centers on War Machine, revealing why he was absent during the battle in New York of The Avengers.[124]\n\nLike with the first two films, Audi again provided product placement with various vehicles.[125] Oracle also returned from Iron Man 2, showcasing both the Oracle Cloud and the Oracle Exadata server.[126] Verizon FiOS and TCL's flat panel televisions and Alcatel One Touch smartphones are also featured in the film,[127] and the Chinese cut also shows a Zoomlion crane and Yili milk.[128] Promotional deals were arranged with Subway and the Schwan Food Company,[127] and tie-ins included Lego sets,[129] Hasbro action figures,[130] and a mobile phone game by Gameloft.[131]\n\nDisney also promoted the film at its domestic theme parks. Disneyland's Innoventions attraction received a Stark Industries exhibit beginning April 13, and Monorail Black of the Walt Disney World Monorail System was given an exterior Iron Man scheme.[132][133] The exhibit, entitled Iron Man Tech Presented by Stark Industries, features the same armor display that was shown at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, with the Marks I-VII and the new Mark XLII. In addition, there is a simulator game, titled \"Become Iron Man,\" that uses Kinect-like technology to allow the viewer to be encased in an animated Mark XLII armor and take part in a series of \"tests,\" in which you fire repulsor rays and fly through Tony Stark's workshop. The game is guided by J.A.R.V.I.S., who is voiced again by Paul Bettany. The exhibit also has smaller displays that include helmets and chest pieces from the earlier films and the gauntlet and boot from an action sequence in Iron Man 3.[134] All-in-all, Disney spent $131 million marketing the film worldwide.[135]\n\nIron Man 3 was distributed worldwide by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures[a] with the exception of China, where it was released by DMG Entertainment, and Germany and Austria, where it was released by Tele München Group.[76] The Chinese version of the film offers specially prepared bonus footage made exclusively for the Chinese audience.[50] This version features a four-minute longer cut of the film, featuring product placement for various Chinese products, as well as an extended scene of Dr. Wu preparing to operate on Stark with his unnamed assistant played by Fan Bingbing.[128][136]\n\nThe film's premiere happened at the Grand Rex in Paris, on April 14, 2013, with Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow in attendance.[137][138] While the UK premiere of the film was originally set for April 17, the funeral of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher taking place in that date made the event be pushed to the following day.[139] Downey, Ben Kingsley and Rebecca Hall were present for the advance screening at London's Odeon Leicester Square.[140] The El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles hosted the United States premiere of Iron Man 3 on April 24.[141] The film opened in 46 countries through April 22–24,[142] with the United States release, on 4,253 screens, happening one week later.[143] Regal Cinemas, AMC Theatres and Carmike Cinemas put presale tickets on hold, two weeks before the US premiere. The cinemas were in a contract dispute with Disney, who wished to receive more of the ticket sale profit than they currently did, largely based on the projected premiere-weekend intake Iron Man 3 was expected to have. Carmike was the first to come to terms with Disney.[144] It was later reported that Cinemark Theatres had also stopped selling presale tickets, and Regal Cinemas had removed all marketing material for the film from its locations.[145] On April 25, 2013, Regal, AMC and Disney ended their dispute, which allowed Regal and AMC to proceed with selling presale tickets again.[146][147]\n\nIMAX screenings began on April 25, 2013, internationally and May 3 in the United States.[114] The film was shown in the 4DX format, featuring strobe lights, tilting seats, blowing wind and fog and odor effects in selected countries.[148][149] In Japan, the technology opened its first room at the Korona World theater in Nagoya, Japan with the release of the film.[150] Iron Man 3 was the first film released in Phase Two of the MCU.[151]\n\nIron Man 3 was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in digital download form on September 3, 2013. This was followed by the film's release on Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray, DVD, digital copy, and on demand on September 24, 2013.[152] The home video release includes a Marvel One-Shot short film titled Agent Carter starring Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter from Captain America: The First Avenger.[153] It debuted atop the DVD and Blu-ray charts in the United States, and second in the rental charts behind World War Z.[154] Iron Man 3 has earned more than $82 million in home media sales in the U.S.[155]\n\nThe film was also collected in a 13-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection\", which includes all of the Phase Two films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was released on December 8, 2015.[156]\n\nIron Man 3 grossed $409 million in North America and $805.8 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $1.215 billion, outgrossing both of its predecessors combined. Worldwide, it became the fifth-highest-grossing film, the second-highest-grossing film of 2013,[157] the second-highest-grossing film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (behind Marvel's The Avengers),[158] and the highest-grossing film of the Iron Man film series,[159] as well as the fourth-highest-grossing comic-book and superhero film overall.[160][161] It achieved the sixth-largest worldwide opening weekend with $372.5 million.[162] On the weekend of May 3–5, 2013, the film set a record for the largest worldwide weekend in IMAX with $28.6 million.[163] On its 23rd day in theaters, Iron Man 3 became the sixth Disney film and the 16th film overall to reach $1 billion.[164] It is the first Iron Man film to gross over $1 billion, becoming the second Marvel film to do so after The Avengers,[33] and was the fourth-fastest film to reach the milestone. As part of the earlier distribution agreement made with Disney in 2010, Paramount Pictures received 9% of the box office gross generated by Iron Man 3.[165] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $391.8 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.[135]\n\nBy the end of its opening day, Iron Man 3 made $68.9 million (including $15.6 million from late Thursday shows),[143] achieving the seventh-highest-grossing opening day.[166] By the end of its opening weekend, the film earned $174.1 million, making it the second-highest opening weekend of all time, behind The Avengers. Of the opening-weekend audience, 55% was over 25 years old, and 61% were males, while only 45% of the gross originated from 3-D screenings. Opening-weekend earnings from IMAX amounted to $16.5 million.[167] It topped the box office during two consecutive weekends and achieved the fourth-largest second-weekend gross with $72.5 million.[168]\n\nThe film earned $13.2 million on its opening day (Wednesday, April 24, 2013) from 12 countries.[169] Through Sunday, April 28, it earned a five-day opening weekend of $198.4 million from 42 countries.[170] The film's opening-weekend gross included $7.1 million from IMAX venues.[171] It set opening-day records in the Philippines (surpassed by Man of Steel), Taiwan,[169] Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia,[172] China,[173] Ukraine,[174] Russia and the CIS,[175] both single- and opening-day records in Thailand and South Africa,[176] as well as a single-day record in Hong Kong.[177] It also scored the second-biggest opening day in Argentina, only behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2.[178] The film set opening-weekend records in the Asia Pacific region, in Latin America, and in individual countries including Argentina (first surpassed by Fast & Furious 6, when including weekday previews),[179] Ecuador,[180] Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore,[170] Thailand, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates.[174] It also achieved the second-largest opening weekend in Mexico,[181] Brazil,[182] and Russia and the CIS.[175] In India, it had the second-best opening weekend for a Hollywood film, after The Amazing Spider-Man.[183] IMAX opening-weekend records were set in Taiwan, the Netherlands, Brazil, and the Philippines.[171] It is the highest-grossing film in Indonesia, Malaysia,[184] and Vietnam[185] and the second-highest-grossing film in Singapore and the Philippines, behind The Avengers.[186] It topped the weekend box office outside North America three consecutive times.[187]\n\nIn China, where part of the production took place, the film set a midnight-showings record with $2.1 million, as well as single-day and opening-day records with $21.5 million (on its opening day).[173] Through its first Sunday, the film earned an opening-weekend total of $64.1 million,[188] making China's opening the largest for the film, followed by a $23.1 million opening in Russia and the CIS, and a $21.2 million opening in the UK, Ireland and Malta.[189] With total earnings reaching $124 million,[190] it was the highest-grossing American film in China in 2013, and the country is the film's highest-grossing market after North America, followed by South Korea ($64.2 million) and the UK, Ireland, and Malta ($57.1 million).[185][189]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 79%, with an average score of 7/10, based on 331 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"With the help of its charismatic lead, some impressive action sequences, and even a few surprises, Iron Man 3 is a witty, entertaining adventure and a strong addition to the Marvel canon.\"[191] Metacritic gave a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[192] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as both its predecessors.[193]\n\nIn an early review by the trade magazine The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy said that, \"After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010, Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment ... [that] benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black.[194] Calling the film \"darker and more serious than its predecessors,\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times credited Black for \"chang[ing] this billion-dollar-plus franchise's tone for the better while keeping the same actor as Tony Stark. ... There is quite a bit of Black's trademark attitude and humor here as well, things like a throwaway reference to the sci-fi classic Westworld and a goofy character who has Tony Stark's likeness tattooed on his forearm. Black and company throw all kinds of stuff at the audience, and though it doesn't all work, a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated.\"[195] Rafer Guzman of Newsday characterized Iron Man as \"the anti-Batman, all zip and zingers. He's also, suddenly, rather family-friendly. Some of the movie's best moments are shared by Stark and latchkey kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), who mock their budding father-son relationship while acting it out.\"[196] Psychology Today concluded that the film presented an accurate portrayal of Tony Stark's posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.[197] Michael Arbeiter of Hollywood.com praised the film as \"Marvel's First True Action-Comedy\", commenting that \"Tony's camaraderie with preteen tech geek Harley Keener is one gigantic superhero/'90s-kid-sidekick laugh riot (the friggin' kid's name is Harley Keener ... is there anything more '90s-kid-sidekick-sounding than that?!).\"[198]\n\nNick De Semlyen of the UK film magazine Empire had criticisms, even while giving the film four of five stars. Finding it \"a swinging caper with wit, balls, heart and exploding baubles,\" he said the villainous \"super-soldiers who can regenerate body parts and survive astounding damage [are] visually interesting ... but their motivation is murky and unconvincing.\"[199] Likewise Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York bestowed 3 of 5 stars, saying, \"Black has massively upped the verbal sparring and kept the broad inventiveness of comic-book malleability in mind. ... The most wonderful of Black's surprises harkens back to his '80s reputation for character revision and is simply too good to ruin here.\" But, he asked, \"[W]hy, finally, are we down at the docks—in the dark, no less—for one of those lumbering climaxes involving swinging shipping cranes? The energy bleeds out of the film; it's as if the producers were scared the crowd would riot over not enough digital fakeness.\"[200]\n\nReacting more negatively, Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger found the film \"slickly enjoyable\" for the visual effects, but said, \"[T]here's something empty about the film. Like Tony's suits, it's shiny and polished. But this time, there's nobody inside ... This movie has neither the emotionalism of the first film, nor the flashy villains of the second ... Tony's relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts is in inexplicable jeopardy—and then simply fixes itself. A supposedly cute kid sidekick—a true sign of authorial desperation—is introduced, and then dropped.\"[201] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune echoed this, saying, \"[I]n a gleefully cynical bid for a preteen audience (a few years too young for the violence in Iron Man 3, I'd say), Stark befriends a bullied 8-year-old  [sic] (Ty Simpkins) who becomes his tag-along and sometime savior ... Stark no longer needs to be in the Iron Man suit. He's able to operate the thing remotely when needed. The movie's like that too. It's decent superhero blockbustering, but rather remote and vaguely secondhand. At this point, even with Black's flashes of black humor, the machinery is more or less taking care of itself, offering roughly half of the genial wit and enjoyment of the first Iron Man.\"[202]\n\nIron Man 3 focuses on contemporary U.S. foreign policy and its consequences.[240] Like the first Iron Man film, it is about the military industrial complex. The main antagonist, Killian, tries to take over the US government and capitalize on the War on Terror with a decoy villain actor, the Mandarin; the supposed looming menace distracts the public from Killian's actions with a narrative of the constant threat that also makes the war profitable.[240] Using Stark as a metaphor of American society, Charlie Jane Anders of Gizmodo notes that the film differs in the portrayal of the country from the previous two entries; whereas the previous films were about the guilt of ruining areas in foreign countries, Iron Man 3 is about the feeling of powerlessness, in that a trusted, wealthy and individualistic celebrity like Stark is unable to find a powerful terrorist such as the Mandarian.[241]\n\nThe Mandarin, a cover-up adversary that is otherwise non-threatening, is a take on Americans' xenophobia towards Middle Easterns,[240] and how people's fear is taken advantage of to create and pass harmful policies.[242] The Mandarin's characteristics are what the population expects from a terrorist, such as a large beard, army pants, and comments he gives to the media that condemn the US. The twist that the Mandarin is fake also plays on audiences' availability heuristics that make them think if someone is a danger or not.[240]\n\nIron Man 3 is part of a trend in post-9/11 superhero films consisting of vulnerable, weak superheroes and complex antagonists with realistic motivations.[242] Psychologist and author Dr. Travis Langley believed Stark meets all of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders's criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder, and Stark, like those with PTSD in real-life, denies he could have it.[243] Stark enacts its symptoms, such as anxiety attacks, hypervigilance, frequent nightmares, and an inability to be in the public;[240][243] this deviates from most portrayals of not only superheroes but also strong male leads in general, where they are not traumatized from perilous situations.[240]\n\nIn March 2013, Black stated that Downey's original contract with Marvel Studios, which expired after the release of Iron Man 3, might be extended in order for the actor to appear in a second Avengers film and at least one more Iron Man film.[244] That April, Cheadle said that Iron Man 3 could be the final film in the series, but acknowledged that he was open to reprise in further Iron Man or other MCU projects.[245] Although Downey said in 2014 that there was no plan for a fourth Iron Man film,[246] he later stated that he was open to reprise his role.[247][248] After the death of Tony Stark in Avengers: Endgame (2019), co-screenwriter Stephen McFeely said, \"You would've already had Iron Man 4 if it was any other studio\", remarking that it was a bold move by Marvel to kill off the character.[249]\n\nIn February 2014, Marvel released the One-Shot film, All Hail the King, on Thor: The Dark World's (2013) home media, featuring Kingsley reprising his role as Trevor Slattery. It continues Slattery's story from the end of the film, revealing that the real Mandarin actually exists in the MCU.[250]\n"

        "content": "\n\nThor: The Dark World is a 2013 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Thor, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to Thor (2011) and the eighth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Alan Taylor from a screenplay by Christopher Yost and the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. It stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor alongside Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgård, Idris Elba, Christopher Eccleston, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Kat Dennings, Ray Stevenson, Zachary Levi, Tadanobu Asano, Jaimie Alexander, Rene Russo, and Anthony Hopkins. In the film, Thor and Loki (Hiddleston) team up to save the Nine Realms from the Dark Elves.\n\nDevelopment of a sequel to Thor began in April 2011 when producer Kevin Feige announced plans for it to follow the MCU crossover film The Avengers (2012). In July, Thor director Kenneth Branagh withdrew from the sequel. Taylor was hired to replace him as director in January 2012. The supporting cast filled out that August with the hiring of Eccleston and Akinnuoye-Agbaje as the film's villains. Filming took place from September to December 2012, primarily in Surrey, England, as well as in Iceland and London. Taylor wanted the film to be more grounded than Thor, inspired by his work on Game of Thrones (2011–2019). He hired Carter Burwell to compose the score, but Marvel replaced Burwell with Brian Tyler.\n\nThor: The Dark World premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on October 22, 2013, and was released in the United States on November 8, as part of Phase Two of the MCU. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $644 million worldwide and becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of 2013. It received praise for the performances of Hemsworth and Hiddleston, visual effects, and action sequences, but was criticized for its generic villain and lack of depth. Retrospectively, Taylor expressed dissatisfaction with the film and said Marvel substantially altered it from his original vision during post-production. Two sequels have been released: Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and Thor: Love and Thunder (2022).\n\nEons ago, Bor—the father of Odin—wages war against the Dark Elf Malekith, who seeks to unleash a weapon known as the Aether on the Nine Realms. After defeating Malekith's forces on their homeworld of Svartalfheim, Bor sends the Aether to a hidden world that no one can reach. However, Malekith escapes with his lieutenant Algrim and a handful of Dark Elves before going into suspended animation.\n\nIn present-day Asgard, Odin imprisons Loki for his various crimes on Earth.[a] Meanwhile, Thor and his companions repel marauders on Vanaheim to pacify the Nine Realms following the reconstruction of the Bifröst—the \"Rainbow Bridge\" between realms which was destroyed two years earlier.[b] The Asgardians learn that the Convergence, a rare alignment of the Nine Realms, is imminent; as the event approaches, portals linking the worlds appear at random.\n\nIn London, astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster travels to an abandoned factory where such portals have appeared. Foster is teleported to the hidden world where the Aether is stored and it enters her body. Thor finds Foster and takes her to Asgard, where Odin warns that the Aether will not only kill her but herald a catastrophic prophecy.\n\nMalekith, awakened by the Aether's release, attacks Asgard searching for Foster. Thor's mother Frigga is killed trying to protect her. Thor recruits Loki, who knows of a secret portal to Svartalfheim where they plan to confront Malekith, to avenge Frigga. On Svartalfheim, Loki uses an illusion to trick Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Foster, but Thor's attempt to destroy it fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves as Loki seemingly dies while killing Algrim.\n\nThor and Foster reunite in London with Foster's mentor, Dr. Erik Selvig. They learn that Malekith plans to plunge the entire universe into darkness by unleashing the Aether at the center of the Convergence in Greenwich. Thor battles Malekith across multiple worlds while Jane's group use their scientific equipment to transport Malekith to Svartalfheim, where he is crushed by his own ship. Thor returns to Asgard, where he declines Odin's offer to take the throne. After he leaves, Loki is revealed to be alive and impersonating Odin.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Volstagg and Sif visit the Collector and entrust the Aether to his care; with the Tesseract already in Asgard, they fear that having two Infinity Stones so close together would be dangerous. As they leave, the Collector states his desire to acquire the other five Stones. In a post-credits scene, Foster and Thor reunite on Earth.\n\nAdditionally, Alice Krige portrays Eir, an Asgardian physician,[44] while Talulah Riley plays an Asgardian nurse.[45] Chris O'Dowd was cast as Richard,[46][47] a suitor of Jane Foster's. Benicio del Toro, who plays Taneleer Tivan / The Collector in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), appears in a mid-credits scene with Ophelia Lovibond, who plays his aide Carina.[48][49][50] Jonathan Howard plays Ian Boothby,[51] Darcy's intern. Tony Curran plays Bor, Odin's father, based on the deity of the same name.[52][53] Clive Russell plays Tyr, based on the deity of the same name.[54] Richard Brake portrays a captain in the Einherjar.[54] Chris Evans makes an uncredited cameo appearance[55] as Loki masquerading as Captain America, while Thor co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance[56] as a patient in a mental ward.\n\n\"In both cases, it's using the conceit of a fantastical, alien world to make fresh what is really a domestic drama. In Game of Thrones, seeing Tyrion battle with his sister Cersei, seeing the relationships between children and their fathers... It's all the stuff we're interested in at a psychological level because we're living it all the time. But it takes place in this otherwise fantastical, foreign realm. I think the same thing is true in Thor. The brilliant thing Ken Branagh did in launching it was making it very much a story about two brothers, a story about brothers competing for the love of their father. So it's small, confined and human at the same time it's this blown-out, intergalactic world.\"\n\nIn April 2011 before the release of Thor (2011), Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige stated that following The Avengers (2012), \"Thor will go off into a new adventure.\"[58] Kenneth Branagh, director of Thor, responded to his comments, saying, \"It is kind of news to me. Here's what I would say to that: It's that I'm thrilled they're that confident. I shall wait for the audience to tell us whether there should be a second one, and then if that's a nice conversation to be had [among] all of us, that'd be thrilling. But I've got too much Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that Thor 2 will happen. But if Marvel says so, then I guess it must be true\".[59] Feige later explained that Marvel Studios would gauge how well Thor did at the box office before announcing sequels, but stated, \"Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two. We've got various options with Ken [Branagh] to discuss coming back, but right now the focus is on the first one. Don is, slowly but surely, thinking about where to take the character next should we be so lucky\".[60]\n\nIn June 2011, Walt Disney Studios set a July 26, 2013, release date for the Thor sequel with Chris Hemsworth reprising his role as the title hero. It was also reported that Branagh would not be returning as director but would likely be involved in a producing capacity.[6] The Los Angeles Times cited the long commitment necessary for a special effects-heavy epic and the pressure to start the script process right away as reasons for Branagh's departure, although he was initially enthused by the chance to direct the sequel.[61] Branagh noted, \"It was a long time [making the first film] and they were way too quick for me to get straight back into another, [but] it was a pleasurable experience and a film I'm very proud of.\"[62] The following day, Marvel formally hired Payne, one of the credited writers of the first film, to script the sequel.[63] An early version of the film planned to feature Hela as the film's antagonist. However, Marvel Studios producer Craig Kyle explained that the Creative Committee from Marvel Entertainment was driving most of the decisions for the film and did not want a female villain because they did not believe they could sell toys based on her to young boys.[64] In August, Brian Kirk entered early negotiations to direct the Thor sequel. The film would have marked Kirk's first time directing a big-budget motion picture, after having directed television series for HBO, Showtime and the BBC, including Game of Thrones (2011–2019).[65]\n\nIn September 2011, Tom Hiddleston confirmed he would return in the sequel, speculating that in the film, \"[Loki will] have to take responsibility for what he's done\".[16] Patty Jenkins, the director of Monster (2003) and the pilot episode of AMC's The Killing (2011–2014), entered early negotiations with Marvel Studios and Disney to direct the film, after Kirk had passed due to contractual sticking points that arose during negotiations.[66] Later in the month, Feige stated the sequel would \"take Thor literally to other worlds\" and would \"primarily be the journey of that character, of he and Jane Foster and how the new dynamic with his father is working out, as well as what are the broader stakes for The Nine Worlds\".[67] On October 13, 2011, Marvel confirmed that Jenkins would direct the sequel and Natalie Portman would return to star.[10] Disney also moved the release date for the film to November 15, 2013.[68]\n\n\"The main difference I have [from Branagh's approach] is really to do with look and tone. Things look really dirty. The first Thor was quite shiny and it was a very conscious, smart choice. When I came in, I wanted to get more of a sense of the Norse mythology: the Viking quality, the texture and weight of the history. He's a superhero, but he's been around for thousands of years. His dad is god!\"\n\nIn December 2011, Jenkins exited the project, citing \"creative differences\".[69] She stated, \"I have had a great time working at Marvel. We parted on very good terms, and I look forward to working with them again\".[70] Jenkins felt she could not have made a good film \"out of Thor 2 because I wasn't the right director... I could have made a great Thor if I could have done the story that I was wanting to do. But I don't think I was the right person to make a great Thor out of the story they wanted to do.\" Jenkins had intended to create a film based on the premise of Romeo and Juliet, where Jane was stuck on Earth with Thor forbidden to come save her. After Thor eventually does travel to Earth, he and Jane would have discovered that Malekith was \"hiding the dark energy inside of Earth because he knows that Odin doesn't care about Earth, and so he's using Odin's disinterest in Earth to trick him\".[71]\n\nThree days later, it was reported that Marvel was looking at Alan Taylor and Daniel Minahan as prospective directors to replace Jenkins, and were also in the midst of hiring a writer to rewrite Don Payne's script, with the shortlist of possible writers consisting of John Collee, Robert Rodat and Roger Avary.[72] At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, was chosen to direct the sequel.[73] Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series Mad Men (2007–2015), Boardwalk Empire (2010–2014) and Game of Thrones as reasons for his hiring, saying \"With Alan's direction we got a few more layers of patina, of texture, of reality into our golden realm.\"[14] As Feige looked at what worked for the first Thor film and thought what he could retool from that, Taylor decided to \"bring some Game of Thrones to it\" in order to make a darker and more grounded sequel in comparison to Branagh's work in the previous film.[74] By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter Rodat to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in London in the summer of 2012.[75][76] Hemsworth later confirmed that filming was scheduled to begin in August.[77][78] Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more Viking-influenced feel, elaborating \"I think the science fiction element to Thor ... the danger is it falls a little bit into the world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the Norse mythology kind of grew from. Having that in Asgard is going to make it all the more special and that's what Alan [Taylor] wants to bring to it.\"[77] Feige said \"while the relationship between Loki and Thor certainly has changed [after the events of the movie The Avengers] and has progressed, a lot of Thor 2 is picking up where it left off in terms of Jane, who you just saw for a moment on a computer monitor, and also what's been going on in the Nine Realms without the Asgardians being able to use the Bifrost.\" Feige also said that while Loki has a part, \"there will be a different villain, another big villain\".[78]\n\nIn May 2012, Mads Mikkelsen began talks to play one of the villains in the film and Anthony Hopkins, who played Odin in the first film, committed to returning in the sequel.[43][79] Benedict Cumberbatch, who eventually joined the film series as Stephen Strange / Doctor Strange, was also in the running to play Malekith the Accursed.[80] At the end of the month, Disney moved up the release date for the film a week ahead of the previous date to November 8, 2013.[81] By June 2012, much of the first film's supporting cast was confirmed to return, including Idris Elba,[23] Jaimie Alexander,[39] Ray Stevenson[33] and Stellan Skarsgård.[21] Also in June, Joshua Dallas announced that he would not be reprising the role of Fandral.[82] Dallas had initially intended to return,[83] but had to bow out due to his commitment on the television show, Once Upon a Time (2011–2018),[82] and Zachary Levi was cast in his place.[35] Levi was originally up for the role in the first film but scheduling conflicts with Chuck (2007–2012) forced him to drop out.[36]\n\nIn July 2012, Mikkelsen stated he would not be appearing in the sequel due to prior commitments, \"That's not happening unfortunately. I had a meeting with [the filmmakers], but it was a bit too late and then Hannibal came in...It's just not happening\".[84] At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that the film would be titled Thor: The Dark World.[85] At the end of the month, residents near Bourne Wood in Surrey, England were notified that a film going by the working title, Thursday Mourning would be filming in the area.[86][87] In August of that year, Christopher Eccleston entered final negotiations to play Malekith,[25] and the film was scheduled to shoot in Iceland, where Taylor shot parts of Game of Thrones.[88] By August 22, Kat Dennings was hired to reprise her role as Darcy Lewis and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was cast as Algrim.[28][32] At the end of the month, film crews for Thursday Mourning began set construction at Stonehenge near Amesbury, England.[89]\n\nPrincipal photography began on September 10, 2012, in Bourne Wood, Surrey, England,[90] under the working title Thursday Mourning.[86][87] A few weeks later, Clive Russell was cast as Tyr, and Richard Brake was cast as an Einherjar captain.[54] At the end of the month, Jaimie Alexander was injured on the London film set, after she slipped while walking in the rain.[91] On October 12, 2012, production moved to Iceland with filming taking place in Dómadalur, Skógafoss, Fjaðrárgljúfur and Skeiðarársandur. Iceland Review described the shoot as being among the most extensive film projects to have ever taken place in Iceland.[92] The film's official synopsis was released, which revealed that Christopher Yost and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely had also contributed to the screenplay.[93] Markus and McFeely said Feige had approached them in between writing drafts for Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) to work on the Dark World script.[94] Three days later, Disney announced that the film would be released in 3D.[95] In late October, filming commenced at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, London.[96] Filming also took place at Shepperton Studios and Longcross Studios in Surrey between October and December 2012.[14][97] Other filming locations included Wembley, Borough Market, Hayes and Stonehenge.[14] Alexander tweeted that principal photography wrapped on December 14, 2012.[98] In a 2013 report on film production costs for films from FilmL.A. Inc., indicated a gross budget of $170 million, with a UK tax offset of $17.3 million for Thor: The Dark World.[2] In 2016 Disney company accounts stated the budget spend was $237.6 million on Thor: The Dark World but $37 million of this was offset by payments from the UK tax authority.[99]\n\nKramer Morgenthau, who worked with Taylor on Game of Thrones, was brought in as the director of photography. Morgenthau said, \"We wanted a grittier, boots-on-the-ground feeling, inspired by what Alan and I had done on Game of Thrones. We wanted the realms to feel grounded, like a real place, while at the same time respecting the magical 'planet of the Gods' feeling and theme.\" Thor: The Dark World was Morgenthau's first time shooting a feature film digitally. For the film, Morgenthau chose the Arri Alexa Plus, although he tested with the Sony F65 but found the Alexa to be more pleasing. In addition to the Alexa, Red Epic and Canon EOS 5D Mark II cameras were used for second unit filming. With the Alexa, Morgenthau used Panavision anamorphic lenses. Morgenthau said, \"The lenses brought some of the magic and mystery of photochemical back to digital, that big-movie look.\" Morgenthau also stated that Thor: The Dark World was easily the most technically complex project that he has worked on but said, \"It's all the same concept and the same principles as in a smaller film. You just scale it up. You do a lot more prep. We had three months of prep and loads of time to pre-rig stages. Part of it is having a really good crew—it's definitely not a one-man show.\"[100]\n\nIn April 2013, McFeely said that \"a lot\" of writers had contributed to the film's script, and he and Markus were uncertain if they would receive final screenwriting credit on the film;[94] Markus and McFeely along with Yost received final screenwriting credit, with Payne and Rodat receiving story credit.[101] In July 2013, Dennings told reporters that the film was about to head into reshoots.[102] In August, Taylor said he shot extra scenes with Hiddleston and was about to shoot more with Hopkins. Taylor explained that it was all a part of the \"Marvel process\" saying, \"We're doing full scenes, scenes that were not in the movie before. We're adding scenes, creating scenes, writing scenes for the first time. The one [involving Loki] was a fun connective scene... We realised how well Loki was working in the movie, and we wanted to do more with him. So it was that kind of thing, it was like, 'Oh, we could do this, we could jam this in here' because he's such a wonderful guy to watch do his stuff.\"[103] Also in August, IMAX Corporation and Marvel Entertainment announced that the film would be digitally re-mastered into the IMAX 3D format and released into IMAX 3D theaters internationally beginning October 30, 2013.[104]\n\nTaylor said The Avengers writer/director Joss Whedon rewrote several scenes in the film explaining, \"Joss came in to save our lives a couple of times. We had a major scene that was not working on the page at all in London, and he basically got airlifted in, like a SWAT team or something. He came down, rewrote the scene, and before he got back to his plane I sort of grabbed him and said, 'And this scene and this scene?' And he rewrote two other scenes that I thought had problems.\"[105] In October 2013, Tony Curran tweeted that he would be portraying Odin's father, Bor, in a flashback sequence.[52][53] In November 2013, Feige stated that the film was intended to be the conclusion of the \"Loki trilogy\", which examined the relationship of Thor and Loki throughout Thor, The Avengers and this film.[106] Loki was originally intended to die in the film, however, after test audiences did not believe he was actually dead, Marvel Studios decided to alter the character's ending.[107] The film's mid-credits scene was directed by James Gunn, the director of Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy (2014).[48][108] The film underwent multiple changes during the reshoots and editing process, with Taylor believing his initial version \"had more childlike wonder\", including starting the film with children, and an overall \"more magical quality\". He noted the reshoots \"inverted\" the original plot in certain ways, such as Loki no longer dying.[74]\n\nThe film's visual effects were completed by seven special effects studios, including Double Negative and Luma Pictures.[109] Blur Studio was the lead studio behind the film's prologue sequence taking place 5,000 years before the start of the film, on the Dark Elves homeworld of Svartalfheim. The sequence consisted mostly of computer graphics with live-action shots interwoven throughout. The use of CG allowed for greater freedom of movement by the characters as the live-action costumes were too constrictive.[110]\n\nTaylor wanted Asgard in this film to have a more natural look than its predecessor. To achieve this, crews filmed the coast of Norway with an Arri Alexa camera for three days in a helicopter, capturing six hours of footage. Double Negative then embedded their CG rendering of Asgard on shots of the natural landscape. Double Negative visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, \"The benefit of that is that you have some real-world terrain to work with – so you have buildings that have to convey natural features. Then from there we went in there populating the terrain with different buildings.\"[110] For scenes taking place on Svartalfheim, production filmed in Iceland with Double Negative adding ruins, mountains, Dark Elf ships, and skies.[110]\n\nFor the shot of the levitating truck, which was used in the film to demonstrate the strange phenomena brought on by the coming of the alignment of the worlds, filmmakers attached a cement truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could be programmed to change speed and movement.[110] In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, Double Negative morphed live action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse. Double Negative then added in smoke and lava-like effects.[110][infringing link?]\n\nThe film's climactic battle sequence takes place through the nine worlds by the use of portals. Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, \"We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing we wanted to do was to make sure it was quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes there are times when Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, quite frankly. We made sure we always kept up the momentum and never stopped the fight. It was a way of making sure the audience weren't conscious there was an effect going on.\"[110]\n\nIn August 2012, Patrick Doyle said that he had discussions with the director about potentially returning to score the film.[111] By April 2013, Carter Burwell had been hired to compose the score,[112] but by the following month he left the film over creative differences.[113] In June 2013, Marvel hired Brian Tyler, who scored Iron Man 3 (2013), to replace Burwell.[114] Tyler said the previous film had an \"attitude and [was] grounded in limitations\" whereas the Thor film allowed for \"all-out regal themes that could be as epic as I could make them.\" The composer described The Dark World as \"science fiction meeting classic medieval war\", leading to a score that drew from works of both genres such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings.[115] Azam Ali is a featured vocalist on the score.[116] The soundtrack was released digitally on October 28, 2013.[117]\n\nIn March 2013, Marvel announced the release of a two-issue comic book prelude by writers Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost and artist Scot Eaton in June 2013.[118] In April 2013, Marvel released the first trailer for Thor: The Dark World. Forbes said, \"This trailer fits nicely into that larger marketing push for Marvel's brand. It puts all of the recognizable characters from the first film front and center, presents the action as a team event reminiscent of the Avengers, and once again Loki—who was quite popular with audiences—makes an appearance.\"[119] The Los Angeles Times said, \"Evident throughout the trailer is director Alan Taylor's influence; the Game of Thrones director's hand can be seen in the battle sequences, and Asgard—a bright and shiny kingdom under Thor director Kenneth Branagh—seems grittier in the sequel.\"[120] In July at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Hiddleston introduced footage from the film to audiences in character as Loki.[121] Also in July, Gameloft announced that a mobile video game titled, Thor the Dark World: The Official Game, would be released in conjunction with the release of the film in November.[122]\n\nThe theatrical poster for the film was released in early August 2013. Kirsten Acuna of Business Insider criticized the poster for its lack of originality, noting its similarities to one of the posters of Iron Man 3, both of which included the female lead clinging to the male lead, with both looking in opposite directions, antagonists prominently displayed in the background and supporting characters featured \"on the side\".[123] Additionally, Marvel released a second trailer for the film as part of YouTube's Geek Week.[124] Forbes said, \"this 150-second trailer is basically just an extended version of last April's 106-second teaser\" and that \"this trailer fails to showcase what's new this time around... making audiences question if they really don't have much else to offer.\"[125] The Los Angeles Times said, that the trailer suggests \"an ominous, epic scale for the sequel\" and that \"the collaboration between Thor and Loki promises to be especially interesting.\"[18] Later in the month, producer Kevin Feige and cast members Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins presented additional footage at Disney's D23 Expo.[126]\n\nAlso in August 2013, Disney announced plans to promote the film with an attraction at Disneyland.[127] The attraction called Thor: Treasures of Asgard, located next to the Stark Industries exhibit inside Innoventions in Tomorrowland, opened on November 1, 2013, and features displays of Asgardian relics and transports guests to Odin's throne room, where they are greeted by Thor.[128] The eighth episode of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., titled \"The Well\", takes place in the aftermath of the events of Thor: The Dark World. It first aired on November 19, 2013.[129] Jaimie Alexander reprised her role as Sif in the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode \"Yes Men\", which aired on March 11, 2014.[130]\n\nThe world premiere of Thor: The Dark World took place on October 22, 2013, at the Odeon Leicester Square in London.[131] The film was released theatrically in the UK eight days later, on October 30.[132] The film held its North American premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, and was released into U.S. theaters on November 8, 2013.[133] Thor: The Dark World is part of Phase Two of the MCU.[134]\n\nThor: The Dark World was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment for digital download on February 4, 2014, and on Blu-ray Disc, 3D Blu-ray, and DVD on February 25, 2014.[135] The physical media release includes deleted scenes, extended scenes, a gag reel, audio commentary by the cast and crew, and a Marvel One-Shot short film entitled All Hail the King,[136] featuring Ben Kingsley reprising his role as Trevor Slattery from Iron Man 3.[137]\n\nThe film was also collected in a 13-disc box set, titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection\", which includes all of the Phase Two films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was released on December 8, 2015.[138]\n\nThor: The Dark World earned $206.4 million in North America and $438.4 million in other markets for a worldwide total of $644.8 million.[4] It surpassed the gross of its predecessor after just 19 days of its release.[139] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $139.4 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.[140]\n\nThor: The Dark World made an estimated $7.1 million in Thursday night showings, more than double the midnight gross of its predecessor.[141] On Friday, November 8, 2013, the film topped the box office with $31.9 million (including Thursday night earnings), which is 25% higher than the original film's opening-day gross.[142] Through Sunday, the film remained at the No. 1 spot with $85.7 million, which is a 30% increase over its predecessor's opening weekend.[143] This was the largest November opening for a film distributed by Disney, surpassing The Incredibles.[144] Thor: The Dark World topped the box office in North America during its first two weekends,[145] before being overtaken by The Hunger Games: Catching Fire in its third weekend.[146]\n\nOn its midweek opening day of Wednesday, October 30, 2013, Thor: The Dark World earned $8.2 million from 33 territories,[147] including the United Kingdom and France, where it opened higher than its predecessor.[148] During its first three days, the film earned $45.2 million,[149] and by the end of the weekend, after expanding into three more territories, it totaled $109.4 million over five days, finishing in first place in all 36 countries.[149] Its largest openings were recorded in China ($21.0 million),[150] the United Kingdom ($13.8 million), and France ($9.94 million).[4] It topped the box office outside North America on its first three weekends of release.[145] In total earnings, its largest markets are China ($55.3 million), Russia and the CIS ($35.7 million), Brazil ($27.7 million), and the United Kingdom ($26.2 million).[4]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 67%, with an average score of 6.2/10, based on 290 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"It may not be the finest film to come from the Marvel Universe, but Thor: The Dark World still offers plenty of the humor and high-stakes action that fans have come to expect.\"[151] It was the lowest-rated MCU film on Rotten Tomatoes until the release of Eternals in 2021.[152][153] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 54 out of 100 based on 44 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[154] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an \"A−\" average, based on a grading scale ranging from A+ to F.[155]\n\nBen Child of The Guardian said, \"Thanks to Hiddleston and Hemsworth's impressive collective charisma, Thor: The Dark World is far from a franchise killer.\"[156] Justin Chang of Variety wrote, \"This robust, impersonal visual-effects showpiece proves buoyant and unpretentious enough to offset its stew of otherwise derivative fantasy/action elements.\"[157] Alonso Duralde of TheWrap said, \"Thor: The Dark World delivers the goods—action, otherworldly grandiosity, romance, humor—above and beyond its predecessor\".[158] Simon Abrams, writing for RogerEbert.com said, \"There's just enough tension and humor in Thor: The Dark World to make the film's otherwise listless proceedings worth watching, but only just.\"[159]\n\nConversely, Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph said, \"It feels entirely made by committee—the definition of house style, without a personal stamp in sight.\"[160] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"Although director Alan Taylor manages to get things going properly for the final battle in London, the long stretches before that on Asgard and the other branches of Yggdrasil are a drag, like filler episodes of Game of Thrones but without the narrative complexity, mythical heft or all-pervading sexiness.\"[161] Michael Phillips of the Los Angeles Times described Thor: The Dark World as having the \"same old threats of galaxy annihilation spiced with fairly entertaining fish-out-of-water jokes\".[162] Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times said, \"the battle scenes are as lacking in heat and coherence as the central love story\".[163]\n\nTaylor expressed dissatisfaction with the finished film and blamed its mixed reception on changes Marvel Studios made during post-production, which he felt conflicted with his creative vision.[164] In 2015, he called working on The Dark World a \"particularly wrenching\" experience,[165] and said in 2021 that the experience made him hesitant to continue directing.[166] Taylor expressed interest in creating a director's cut similar to Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021), though he observed that Marvel was likely not interested in it.[164]\n\nThor: Ragnarok was released on November 3, 2017,[176] directed by Taika Waititi.[177] Eric Pearson and Craig Kyle & Christopher Yost wrote the screenplay,[178] with Kevin Feige again producing.[179] Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Hopkins, Elba, Asano, Levi, and Stevenson reprise their roles as Thor, Loki, Odin, Heimdall, Hogun, Fandral, and Volstagg, respectively,[177][180][181][182][183] while Mark Ruffalo and Benedict Cumberbatch appear as Bruce Banner / Hulk and Doctor Strange respectively, reprising their roles from previous MCU films.[184][185] Cate Blanchett, Tessa Thompson, Jeff Goldblum and Karl Urban join the cast as Hela, Valkyrie, Grandmaster, and Skurge, respectively.[177]\n\nA fourth film titled Thor: Love and Thunder was released on July 8, 2022.[186] Hemsworth, Thompson,[187] and Elba reprised their roles,[188] with Portman,[187] Alexander,[189] Dennings, and Skarsgård returning after not appearing in Ragnarok.[188] Portman portrayed her character taking on the mantle of Thor, similar to the comics.[190] Additionally, Chris Pratt, Pom Klementieff, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, and Sean Gunn reprise their roles as Guardians of the Galaxy members Peter Quill / Star-Lord, Mantis, Drax the Destroyer, Nebula, Groot, Rocket, and Kraglin Obfonteri.[191] Christian Bale joined the cast as the villain Gorr the God Butcher.[192]\n"

        "content": "\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier is a 2014 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and the ninth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo from a screenplay by the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. It stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America alongside Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Cobie Smulders, Frank Grillo, Emily VanCamp, Hayley Atwell, Toby Jones, Jenny Agutter, Robert Redford, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Rogers joins forces with Natasha Romanoff (Johansson) and Sam Wilson (Mackie) to uncover a conspiracy within the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. while facing a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier (Stan).\n\nMarkus and McFeely began writing the sequel around the release of The First Avenger in July 2011. The script draws from the Winter Soldier story arc in the comic books written by Ed Brubaker and conspiracy fiction from the 1970s such as Three Days of the Condor (1975). The film explores S.H.I.E.L.D., similarly to how the first film explored the U.S. military after Rogers was shown working for the agency in the MCU crossover film The Avengers (2012). The Russo brothers signed to direct in June 2012, and casting began the following month. Filming began in April 2013 in Los Angeles, California, before moving to Washington, D.C., and Cleveland, Ohio. Though the directors used practical effects and intense stunt work, 2,500 visual effects shots were created by six companies.\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on March 13, 2014, and was released in the United States on April 4, as part of Phase Two of the MCU. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances, action sequences, storyline, and themes. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. It grossed $714 million worldwide, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2014. A sequel titled Captain America: Civil War, also directed by the Russos, was released in 2016. \n\nTwo years after the Battle of New York,[a] Steve Rogers works in Washington, D.C., for the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., while adjusting to contemporary society. During a mission alongside Agent Natasha Romanoff and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s counter-terrorism S.T.R.I.K.E. team led by Agent Brock Rumlow to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from pirates led by Georges Batroc, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another assignment: to extract data from the ship's computers.\n\nReturning to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, Rogers confronts Director Nick Fury and is briefed about Project Insight: three Helicarriers linked to spy satellites, designed to eliminate threats preemptively. Unable to decrypt Romanoff's data, Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official and Secretary of Internal Security Alexander Pierce to delay the project. On his way to rendezvous with Maria Hill, Fury is ambushed by assailants led by an assassin called the Winter Soldier. Escaping to Rogers' apartment, Fury warns him that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised but is shot by the Winter Soldier before handing Rogers a flash drive containing the ship's data. Fury is pronounced dead during surgery, and Hill recovers the body.\n\nPierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion. When Rogers withholds Fury's information, Pierce brands him a fugitive. Hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., Rogers meets with Romanoff. Using the data, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer containing the preserved consciousness of Arnim Zola. Zola reveals that after being captured by Rogers during World War II,[b] he was recruited to S.H.I.E.L.D., where he secretly reformed Hydra within its ranks, sowing global chaos using the Winter Soldier as their primary assassin. The pair narrowly escapes death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and they realize that Pierce is Hydra's leader within S.H.I.E.L.D. Rogers and Romanoff enlist the help of VA employee and former USAF pararescueman Sam Wilson, whom Rogers befriended, and acquire a powered \"Falcon\" wingpack used by Wilson while he was in the Air Force.\n\nThey capture S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jasper Sitwell, a Hydra mole, forcing him to divulge that Zola developed a data mining algorithm that can identify individuals becoming future threats to Hydra. The Insight Helicarriers will sweep the globe using satellite guns to eliminate the threat. Sitwell is killed in an ambush by the Winter Soldier, whom Rogers recognizes as Bucky Barnes, his longtime best friend previously thought dead; he had survived due to Zola's experimentation and has been repeatedly brainwashed and cryogenically frozen to perform Hydra's missions. Hill manages to extract the trio to a safehouse where Fury, who had faked his death, plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing their controller chips.\n\nAfter the World Security Council members arrive for the Helicarriers' launch, Rogers broadcasts Hydra's plot to everyone at the Triskelion. Romanoff, disguised as one of the Council members, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database so Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Following a struggle, Fury fatally shoots Pierce. Rogers and Wilson raid two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips, but Barnes destroys Wilson's suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other.\n\nRogers refuses to fight Barnes in an attempt to reach his friend, but as the ship collides with the Triskelion, Rogers falls into the Potomac River. Barnes rescues the unconscious Rogers before disappearing into the woods. With S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray, Romanoff appears before a Senate subcommittee to defend her and Rogers' actions. Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Europe to pursue Hydra's remaining cells. Rogers and Wilson decide to find Barnes, while Rumlow, who was a Hydra agent, is hospitalized following the Triskelion's destruction.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, at a Hydra lab, Baron Wolfgang von Strucker and his scientists examine an energy-filled scepter[c] and two test subjects: one with superhuman speed, the other with telekinetic powers.[d] In a post-credits scene, Barnes visits his own memorial at the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nAdditionally, Maximiliano Hernández and Garry Shandling reprise their roles from previous MCU films as Jasper Sitwell and Senator Stern, respectively.[46][47] Georges St-Pierre plays Georges Batroc, a mercenary and a master of the French form of kickboxing known as savate.[48][49] Callan Mulvey plays Jack Rollins, a member of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s S.T.R.I.K.E. unit.[50][51] In addition to Agutter, Chin Han, Alan Dale, and Bernard White appear as members of the World Security Council.[52][53] Comedic actors Danny Pudi[53] and DC Pierson[54] have small roles as a S.H.I.E.L.D. technician and an Apple Store employee, respectively. Gary Sinise narrates a Captain America-themed Smithsonian Institution exhibit, and Stan Lee cameos as a security guard there.[53] Winter Soldier creator Ed Brubaker makes a cameo as a scientist working on the Winter Soldier.[55][56] Co-director Joe Russo cameos as a doctor,[54] and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely cameo as two S.H.I.E.L.D. interrogators. Thomas Kretschmann, Henry Goodman, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Elizabeth Olsen make uncredited appearances as Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, Dr. List, Pietro Maximoff, and Wanda Maximoff, respectively, in the mid-credits scene.[57][6][58]\n\nWe hired our directors on Cap because they loved our explanation that we really want to make a '70s political thriller masquerading as a big superhero movie. Just like with the first film—we got Joe Johnston because we said, \"We want to do a '40s World War II movie masquerading as a big superhero movie.\" I love that we're doing a sequel to a film that's a completely different genre than the first film. I think that's fun. And the comics do it all the time.\n\nIn April 2011, before Captain America: The First Avenger was released in theaters, screenwriters Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely announced that Marvel had already hired the duo to work on the film's sequel.[60] In September 2011, Chris Evans, who portrayed Steve Rogers / Captain America in The First Avengers, said that a sequel might not be released until 2014.[7] In January 2012, Neal McDonough, who played Dum Dum Dugan in The First Avenger, mentioned that a sequel would likely be filmed after the completion of Thor: The Dark World (2013), which would likely have been before the end of 2012.[61] By March 2012, Marvel whittled down the possible directors for the sequel to three candidates: George Nolfi, F. Gary Gray, and brothers Anthony and Joseph Russo.[62] Walt Disney Studios announced the planned release of the sequel to The First Avenger on April 4, 2014. Disney said, \"The second installment will pick-up where ... The Avengers (2012) leaves off, as Steve Rogers continues his affiliation with Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. and struggles to embrace his role in the modern world.\"[63] Markus later elaborated, \"I think S.H.I.E.L.D. is the water [Rogers is] swimming in. It's definitely a Captain America movie. You know, if the first movie was a movie about the US Army, then this is a movie about S.H.I.E.L.D... You will learn about S.H.I.E.L.D. You will learn about where it came from and where it's going and some of the cool things they have.\"[12] In April, F. Gary Gray withdrew his name from consideration, choosing instead to direct the N.W.A biographical film Straight Outta Compton (2015).[64]\n\nMcFeely said the writing began in the middle of 2011, around the release of The First Avenger, with him and Markus \"noodling on in hopes that there would be a second one and we did a lot of just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what stuck\".[65] The first few months of writing were a back and forth process with Marvel, but after an outline was finished, the story did not change much.[66] They opted to set the story in the present day, and, after \"experimenting with flashback elements for more period World War II stuff\",[67] decided to abandon the flashbacks as \"it became unwieldy.\"[65] The film would be \"Cap versus the world we all live in today\",[68] while averting excessive comedy regarding the hero's time displacement, as Markus considered the Captain \"the most adaptive man on the planet.\"[65] The tone would be more grounded in reality despite the advanced technology to contrast the fantasy elements from both the first Captain America and The Avengers.[68] Despite that, the comic book origins guaranteed that the film would have no verisimilitude.[42] This still proved a challenge in the reveal of Arnim Zola, that had to be extensively rewritten to convey how \"this grounded espionage paranoid thriller suddenly screeches to a halt and you switch gears really quickly with this ghost in the machine\" that introduces more science fiction elements.[69]\n\nMarkus and McFeely wanted to adapt Ed Brubaker's Winter Soldier storyline from the comics, which they described as \"the tone of Cap's modern franchise\",[70] but it took the duo six months to convince themselves they could do it.[17] In the meantime, while thinking how to progress from the war film tone of The First Avenger, the writers settled on the conspiracy genre for the screenplay, and cited Three Days of the Condor (1975), The Parallax View (1974), and Marathon Man (1976) as influences, feeling it better conveyed Captain America's trust issues and contrasting values in the new world he was living in,[17] with Markus saying, \"If you put that 1940s man into present day geo-politics everything is going to seem like a conspiracy. It's just going to seem dirty and underhanded and shifty, and people won't be telling the truth.\"[70] Three Days of the Condor in particular was used as the main source of the script structure, following the idea that the protagonist is being chased by a threat they, along with the audience, only discover halfway through the film.[42]\n\n\nThe writers felt this approach was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with \"the Captain dealing with all sorts of the same things that the country [was] dealing with—Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff—so he gets to have opinions on that\", thus making the \"guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in.\"[71] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller,[72] and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing \"the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world.\"[73] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies.[70] The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Zola being kept alive as a machine.[68] Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, \nIn our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [Three Days of the Condor]. Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men (1976). This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it was a hell of a journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.[74]\nFeige said that Steve Rogers would be paired with other characters from The Avengers like Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow and Nick Fury, because unlike Tony Stark and Thor, who could return to their own supporting casts, Rogers had nowhere else to go, \"and it just made sense that he was the one that stayed with what remains of the Avengers at the end of the film.\"[75] The writers considered including Clint Barton / Hawkeye–who was played by Jeremy Renner in Thor (2011) and  The Avengers–but \"he didn't have enough to do and suddenly it seemed like we were giving him short shrift\", leading all of his parts to be fulfilled by Black Widow,[70] and Joe Russo added that Renner's schedule could not be worked out for him to appear.[76] As to why Johann Schmidt / Red Skull from The First Avenger did not appear in The Winter Soldier, Joe Russo explained, \"I know we have a guy in a computer, but the tone we were chasing was sort of that conspiracy thriller. And we wanted to try and ground the movie as much as we could. And Red Skull, he's a fantastical character and didn't necessarily fit for Cap 2 and especially because it was about the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. Certainly Hydra exists and that's his legacy, but there's something interesting about the fact that his legacy outlived the skull. And they're still dealing with the demons of it, but not necessarily him.\"[77] Chris McKenna, who worked with the Russo brothers on the sitcom Community (2009–2014), contributed to the script by writing jokes for the film.[78] The inclusion of the passage \"Ezekiel 25:17\" on Fury's tombstone references the character Jules Winnfield, from the 1994 film Pulp Fiction, also played by Samuel L. Jackson.[79]\n\nIt's hard to make a political film that's not topical. That's what makes a political thriller different from just a thriller. And that's what adds to the characters' paranoia and the audience's experience of that paranoia. But we're also very pop-culture-obsessed and we love topicality, so we kept pushing to [have] scenes that, fortunately or unfortunately, played out [during the time that Edward] Snowden outed the NSA. That stuff was already in the zeitgeist. We were all reading the articles that were coming out questioning drone strikes, pre-emptive strikes, civil liberties—[Barack] Obama talking about who they would kill... We wanted to put all of that into the film because it would be a contrast to [Captain America]'s greatest-generation [way of thinking].\n\nBy June 2012, the Russo brothers entered negotiations to direct the sequel,[81] and Jackson was confirmed to return as S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Nick Fury.[45] Feige sought out the Russos after watching the genre-parodying season 2 finale of Community which Joe directed,[82][83] and for the additional ideas they brought to the initial story pitch.[84] Joe Russo detailed that since the intent was for a political thriller, \"all the great political thrillers have very current issues in them that reflect the anxiety of the audience.\" Thus, the brothers opted to include references to drone warfare, targeted killing and global surveillance. Joe even noted how during principal photography, the issues became more topical due to the disclosure of several National Security Agency surveillance-related documents.[85] At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that the official title for the sequel was Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and that the Russo brothers would direct the film.[86] After signing on to direct, the Russo brothers met with Ed Brubaker to learn more about where the Winter Soldier character came from, his thinking and the themes behind the character.[87] In July 2012, Anthony Mackie entered negotiations to star as Sam Wilson / Falcon alongside Evans in the sequel.[14] At that time, Sebastian Stan was also confirmed to be reprising his role as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier from The First Avenger in the film.[14]\n\nIn September 2012, Evans said filming would begin in March 2013.[88] He also said that Rogers' adjustment to the modern world, which was originally set to be included in The Avengers, would be better suited for The Winter Soldier.[89] At the end of the month, The Greater Cleveland Film Commission announced that Captain America: The Winter Soldier would film in Cleveland, Ohio after the production was approved for a $9.5 million tax credit.[90] Producer Nate Moore said that after also serving as a location in The Avengers, Cleveland's government was helpful in providing large locations for filming, which \"provided production value which we probably could not have built in a backlot.\" McFeely joked that while writing ambitious action scenes \"I did not realize a great American metropolis would say 'Sure, shut down three miles of freeway and go to town'.\"[19] Portions of the film were also scheduled to be shot in California and Washington, D.C.[90][91] By October, Emilia Clarke, Jessica Brown Findlay, Teresa Palmer, Imogen Poots, Alison Brie, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were being considered for Rogers' love interest in the film,[10][92] and Scarlett Johansson was brought back to reprise her role as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow.[10] Later in the month, Frank Grillo was testing for the role of Brock Rumlow in the film,[93] and by the end of the month, Grillo closed a deal to portray the character and Cobie Smulders signed on to reprise her role as Maria Hill from The Avengers.[27] Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Josh Holloway, and Kevin Durand were also considered for the role of Rumlow.[92]\n\nIn January 2013, Hayley Atwell, who played Peggy Carter in The First Avenger, said that she would not appear in the sequel.[94] However, Stanley Tucci, who played Dr. Abraham Erskine in the previous film, later said that Atwell would reappear in a flashback scene.[95] Also in January, Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in 3D, and Anthony Mackie said filming would begin on April 1, 2013.[96][97] Later that month, Toby Jones, who portrayed Arnim Zola in the first film, said that he would reprise the role in the sequel.[38] By the end of the month, stages were being built for a shoot at Raleigh Manhattan Beach Studios in Los Angeles.[98] In February 2013, Emily VanCamp entered negotiations to play a female lead in the film.[99] Karen Gillan also auditioned for the role of Sharon Carter; Gillan would subsequently portray the Guardians of the Galaxy member Nebula in the MCU.[100] By March 2013, Maximiliano Hernández was signed to reprise his role as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jasper Sitwell from Thor and The Avengers and Robert Redford entered in talks to join the cast, as a high-ranking member of S.H.I.E.L.D.,[46][101] which he later confirmed.[43] Toward the end of March, UFC fighter Georges St-Pierre was cast as Georges Batroc in the film.[48] Powers Boothe was asked to reprise his role as Gideon Malick from The Avengers, but was unable to due to working on Nashville (2012–2018).[102]\n\nCaptain America's uniform was altered from the ones seen in previous films, with a Kevlar-based ballistic component that would protect Captain America but at the same time function like a military uniform.[9] Joe Russo said, \"We wanted to use his Super Soldier outfit from the [Steve Rogers: Super Soldier series] as a way to represent, thematically, his place in the world of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the difference between working for S.H.I.E.L.D. and being Captain America.\"[103] For the Falcon costume, the filmmakers were interested in adding more of a tactical design than was represented in the comic books, by including real-world webbing, straps and gear and stripping away the more comic book elements.[9]\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 1, 2013, at the Raleigh Manhattan Beach Studios in Los Angeles, under the working title Freezer Burn.[104] Scenes taking place on the Lemurian Star were filmed on the Sea Launch Commander, docked in Long Beach, California.[19] In early May, Dominic Cooper confirmed he would return to reprise his role as Howard Stark from The First Avenger in the film.[105] On May 14, 2013, production moved to Washington, D.C., with filming taking place at the National Mall and the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge.[106] The following day, Garry Shandling was spotted on set reprising his Iron Man 2 (2010) role of Senator Stern.[47] Other filming locations in Washington, D.C., included the Willard Hotel and Dupont Circle.[107] Filming in Cleveland began on May 17 and was scheduled to last until mid-June with locations scheduled on the West Shoreway, the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant in Cuyahoga Heights and the Lakeview Cemetery Dam.[108] Cleveland was chosen as a stand-in for Washington, D.C., with the city's East 6th Street doubling as 7th and D Streets in Southwest D.C.[109] Other locations in Cleveland included the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, the Cleveland Public Library, Cleveland State University, the Cleveland Arcade, Tower City Center, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and the Western Reserve Historical Society.[109][110][111][112][113] Interior shots were also filmed inside private homes and the Pilgrim Congregational Church in Tremont.[114] Filming in Cleveland concluded on June 27, 2013.[115]\n\nTrent Opaloch, best known for his work on District 9 (2009) and Elysium (2013), was brought in as the director of photography. Opaloch said that while attempting to emulate the 1970s thrillers that served as inspiration for the writers and directors, the staging and lighting tried to bring realism through \"classic framing and naturalistic lighting\", and the filming was done with hand-held cameras. To achieve this, Opaloch used Arri Alexa Plus 4:3 cameras with Panavision anamorphic lenses and Codex Digital recorders.[116] Stunt work aimed for realistic action, prioritizing practical effects. The fight scenes were staged for months, with a choreography that aimed to highlight Captain America's superhuman qualities, and \"move away from impressionistic action into specificity\": the raid on the S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel had stealthiness as the Captain knocked out enemies to avert detection, and the freeway fight with Winter Soldier was more \"last minute\" to highlight the characters' struggle to survive.[19] In contrast to the quick editing and moving cameras of modern action films, The Winter Soldier aimed to feature longer action scenes that felt more visceral and dangerous.[42] The Russos mentioned the bank robbing scene of Heat (1995) as a major influence, which they described as \"the most intense eight minutes of filmmaking I've seen in a movie theater\",[19] and action scenes directed by Brian De Palma, such as the vault heist in Mission: Impossible (1996) where \"very likable characters are put in impossible situations that the audience is put on the edge on how they'd escape\". Examples of these types of scenes include the ambushes on Nick Fury in the street and Captain America in the elevator.[42]\n\nAdditional photography was filmed in December 2013 and January 2014,[117] for the Russos to accurately show the state of each character after the defeat of S.H.I.E.L.D., having read the script of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) to guide their choices.[42] Joss Whedon, director of The Avengers and Age of Ultron, wrote and directed the mid-credits scene,[118] which featured Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Pietro Maximoff,[6] and Thomas Kretschmann as Baron Wolfgang von Strucker.[57] The title sequences were created by design firm Sarofsky, who had worked with the Russos since Community. Sarofsky collaborated with comic book artist David W. Mack on the sequences.[119]\n\nAnthony Mackie said the Russo brothers relied on minimal use of computer-generated imagery, stating, \"The Russos, what they did that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form. If they can build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great.\"[120] Nevertheless, six special effects companies were involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Scanline VFX, Lola Visual Effects, Luma Pictures, Whiskytree and The Embassy, with previsualization completed by Proof.[37] The film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ILM.[121] The film featured extensive use of digital doubles. Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, \"The character that we did the most work on was Falcon. We knew we were going to do CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. And we needed a very good digital double.\"[121] Lola VFX, who worked on the pre-serum Steve Rogers scenes in this film and The First Avenger, also worked on shots featuring an elderly Peggy Carter. This involved digitally transposing the facial features of an elderly actress onto the face of Atwell, who had performed her lines with no make-up and only a few tracking markers.[37]\n\nThe Helicarriers in the film were completely digital. Earl said, \"In [The Avengers] it was more like an aircraft carrier, now it's an aircraft carrier with the addition of battle ship-sized guns. We were all over the carriers [with the virtual camera]. We were on the decks; we were flying next to them. We had a lot of close ups and different angles. And we didn't just have one; we had three. On top of that, we had to destroy them all.\" This CGI environment was also used in close ups. Earl said, \"The challenge was to get in all of the detail to make it feel like it is a real, working ship. We created details down to the railings and all the human-scale stuff. ... For the shots in which we were destroying them, we had to have the internals as well—the hallways, the storage areas.\"[121] Many of the shots of Washington, D.C., were digitally created due to numerous flight restrictions in the city which necessitated that locations be recreated by computer.[121] However, aerial footage of the city was filmed and used for live action plate photography for shots involving the Triskelion, which is located on Theodore Roosevelt Island on the Potomac River.[37]\n\n350 different versions of the film were made, to accommodate for the different formats it would be released in domestically, while also accounting for international localization and formats. The versions had to be completed in 17 days, versus a normal turnaround time of three to four weeks for contemporary films, to make its theatrical release date.[122] One of the various changes for localization was the contents of Captain America's notebook list seen at the beginning of the film. The first five items were different depending on where the film was released, while the final five items were the same across all prints.[123] Marvel held online polls allowing fans to select the items featured in each country's release.[124]\n\nIn June 2013, Henry Jackman announced that he would compose the film's score.[125] About the score Jackman said, \"...it's 50% production and all the tricks I've learnt from spending years in the record industry but then it's also got the kind of injection of symphonic, thematic, heroic music that all kind of merges into one musical, and hopefully coherent piece\".[126] A soundtrack album was released by Hollywood Records on April 1, 2014.[127]\n\nIn July 2013, Marvel Studios released a teaser poster depicting a damaged and discolored Captain America shield.[128] The Los Angeles Times said, \"the image suggests that [Captain America] might see some serious battle in the sequel\" while Rolling Stone said, \"the image hints at darker themes in the sequel\".[129][130] Later that month, Marvel Studios head and producer Kevin Feige, directors Joe and Anthony Russo, and cast members Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Cobie Smulders, Emily VanCamp, and Frank Grillo held a panel at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con and presented footage from the film.[131] In addition, Marvel had booths depicting a Smithsonian-type exhibit showing Captain America and the Howling Commandos from Captain America: The First Avenger.[132] At the end of the month, audiences were shown a glimpse of the film along with some of Marvel's other Phase Two slate of films at Disney XD's Disney Fandom event.[133]\n\nIn August 2013, Feige, Evans, Stan, and Mackie presented a clip of the film at Disney's D23 Expo.[134] In September 2013, Marvel announced that it is again partnering with Harley-Davidson, continuing their relationship from Captain America: The First Avenger, with Captain America riding the company's Softail Breakout motorcycle in the film.[135]\n\nIn October 2013, Marvel released the first trailer for Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The Hollywood Reporter said, \"it looks like it'll live up to the 'political thriller' that's been promised for months now.\"[136] Los Angeles Times said, \"[the] trailer runs 2½ minutes and teases plenty of action, conspiracy and clever banter between Captain America and his S.H.I.E.L.D. colleagues, with a smattering of the previously released Comic-Con International and D23 footage.\"[137] Los Angeles Times also noted that the day before the release of the trailer, the studio released \"a teaser for a trailer.\"[138] The trailer received 23.5 million views in the 24 hours after its release.[139] In November 2013, Jed Whedon, the co-creator of the television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013–2020), said that there were plans to reference events from the film into the show, stating, \"Nick Fury is in [Captain America: The Winter Soldier], and S.H.I.E.L.D. makes an appearance, so we will definitely try to tee-up some stuff and probably play a little bit of the fallout from that film.\"[140]\n\nIn January 2014, Disney announced that in honor of the film, Captain America would be making appearances at Disneyland.[141] The meet and greet experience opened March 7, 2014, and is called Captain America: The Living Legend and Symbol of Courage, located at Innoventions in Tomorrowland.[142] Also in January, Marvel Comics released a prelude digital comic titled, Marvel's Captain America: The Winter Soldier Infinite Comic, written by Peter David, with art by Rock-He Kim.[143] The comic sees the return of the \"Zodiac\", the mysterious weapon first seen in the One-Shot Agent Carter (2013), which has fallen into the wrong hands. Captain America, Black Widow, and Rumlow must track the weapon down and put it back in S.H.I.E.L.D. protection.[144]\n\nThe first televised advertisement for Captain America: The Winter Soldier aired during Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Disney paid over $4 million per 30-second spot.[145] The Los Angeles Times said, \"The clip promoting the April 4 release had a recognizably melancholy tone as Chris Evans' patriotic hero grapples with the moral ambiguities of the modern age.\"[146] Also in February, Gameloft announced that a mobile video game, titled Captain America: The Winter Soldier – The Official Game, would be released in conjunction with the release of the film in late March 2014 for iOS and Android platforms.[147] A few days later General Motors announced that Chevrolet partnered with Marvel Entertainment and provided a specially designed Corvette Stingray C7 for use by the Black Widow in the film. The vehicle debuted at the 2014 Chicago Auto Show, where fans received limited-edition Captain America comic books.[148] Evans was named the grand marshal of the 2014 Daytona 500 to promote the film's release.[149] Later in the month, a 30-second television spot received \"a lot of attention on social media\" for a line featured in the clip. The line, which was said by Captain America, suggests that Nick Fury would die in the film. The Hollywood Reporter noted that it all seemed \"a bit too obvious\", noting the fact that Jackson, who plays Fury, would be reprising the role in Avengers: Age of Ultron, although pointing out that it could be in a postmortem flashback appearance.[150]\n\nIn March 2014, Marvel released the Captain America Experience app, that allowed fans to capture a picture of themselves with Captain America, and let them share it on Instagram and Twitter using specific hashtags to unlock 10 early screenings of the film across the United States,[151] which took place on March 20.[152] On March 18, ABC aired a one-hour television special, titled Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe, which included a sneak peek of Captain America: The Winter Soldier.[153] On April 1, 2014, Evans and Stan rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange in honor of the film's theatrical release.[154] Jackson appeared in advertisements for Sky Broadband.[155]\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier was released in 32 markets on March 26, 2014[156][157] and in North America on April 4, 2014, in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D.[63][96] The film debuted on 668 IMAX screens worldwide, a record for films releasing in April.[158] The world premiere took place on March 13, 2014, at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles.[159] The Paris premiere occurred on March 17 at Le Grand Rex,[160] the London premiere took place on March 20 at Westfield London,[161] the Beijing premiere took place on March 24[162] and the Cleveland premiere took place on April 1.[163] Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson auctioned off passes to one of the premieres for charity.[164] Captain America: The Winter Soldier is part of Phase Two of the MCU.[165]\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment for digital download on August 19, 2014, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, and DVD on September 9, 2014.

The website's critics consensus reads, \"Suspenseful and politically astute, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a superior entry in the Avengers canon and is sure to thrill Marvel diehards.\"[184] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 70 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[185] CinemaScore audiences gave Captain America: The Winter Soldier an \"A\" grade rating on an A+ to F scale.[186]\n\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said the film \"takes the bold (for Marvel) step of reducing CGI spectacle to a relative minimum in favor of reviving the pleasures of hard-driving old-school action, surprising character development and intriguing suspense.\"[187] Scott Foundas of Variety said it is \"chockfull of the breathless cliffhangers dictated by the genre, but equally rich in the quiet, tender character moments that made the first film unique among recent Marvel fare.\"[188] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times considered it \"another rock-solid chapter in the big-screen story of Marvel,\" though he compared it unfavorably to The Avengers, Iron Man and Iron Man 3.[189] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly noted the topicality of the film, and compared it to The Dark Knight (2008).[190] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe said the film \"delivers all the 3D CGI mayhem audiences have come to expect from the Marvel entertainment juggernaut, but there's darkness and confusion just under its comic-book surface.\"[191] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal praised the film's \"emotional bandwidth\" and nuances, and felt it fixed all the shortcomings of The First Avenger \"and then some\".[192]\n\nConversely, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times characterized the film with a lack of inspiration.[193] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, \"Like many others of its type, [Captain America: The Winter Soldier] gets off to a kinetic start only to lose steam before blowing everything up.\"[194] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph expressed disappointment with the lack of risks taken by the film compared to its \"relatively spicy premise\".[195] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt the film was too long, with unexciting and illegible action scenes.[196] Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post Dispatch felt The Winter Soldier didn't explore the issues it raised and paled in comparison to The First Avenger.[197] Jake Coyle of the Associated Press said the film's biggest misstep was the handling of Stan's Winter Soldier, and that it was \"getting difficult to tell the Marvel movies apart\".[198]\n\nSeveral critics have drawn comparisons between The Winter Soldier and the Metal Gear Solid video game series. Gameranx compared the film to Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001), stating that the first half of The Winter Soldier \"feels like probably the closest movie adaptation we've gotten to Metal Gear Solid 2\", with similar elements including the \"stealth, an evil group, CQC, and even the moral dilemma about sacrificing one's personal liberties for the feeling of security.\"[199] Entertainment Weekly noted that the film's opening tanker mission was \"rendered as a Metal Gear Solid stealth mission\".[200] Eye For Film also said the opening sequence \"will no doubt be familiar to anyone who's ever played Metal Gear Solid 2\".[201]\n\nCaptain America: Civil War was released on May 6, 2016, with the Russo brothers returning to direct, and Markus and McFeely again writing the screenplay.[213][214] Evans, Johansson, Stan, Mackie, VanCamp, and Grillo reprise their roles from The Winter Soldier[215][216] and are joined by Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, Paul Bettany as Vision, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff, Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man, and William Hurt as Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross,[217] all reprising their roles from previous MCU films.

        "content": "\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy (retroactively referred to as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1)[4][5] is a 2014 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 10th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by James Gunn, who wrote the screenplay with Nicole Perlman, it features an ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldaña, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, and Bradley Cooper as the titular Guardians, along with Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Djimon Hounsou, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close, and Benicio del Toro. In the film, Peter Quill (Pratt) and a group of extraterrestrial criminals go on the run after stealing a powerful artifact.\n\nPerlman began working on the screenplay in 2009. Producer Kevin Feige first publicly mentioned Guardians of the Galaxy as a potential film in 2010 and Marvel Studios announced it was in active development at the July 2012 San Diego Comic-Con. Gunn was hired to write and direct the film that September. In February 2013, Pratt was hired to play Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and the supporting cast members were subsequently confirmed. Principal photography began in July 2013 at Shepperton Studios in England, with filming continuing in London before wrapping in October 2013. In addition to an original score by Tyler Bates, the soundtrack includes several popular songs from the 1960s and 1970s chosen by Gunn. Post-production was completed on July 7, 2014.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on July 21, 2014, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 1 as part of Phase Two of the MCU. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $773.3 million worldwide and became the third-highest-grossing film of 2014. It was praised for its screenplay, direction, acting, humor, soundtrack, visual effects and action sequences. It was nominated for two awards at the 87th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades. Two sequels have been released: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023).\n\nIn 1988, following his mother's death, the child Peter Quill is abducted from Earth by the Ravagers, a group of alien thieves and smugglers led by Yondu Udonta. In 2014, on the abandoned planet Morag, Quill steals a mysterious Orb but is attacked by the fanatical Kree renegade Ronan the Accuser, led by Korath. Although Quill escapes with the Orb, Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin Gamora after the Orb.\n\nWhen Quill attempts to sell the Orb on Xandar, the capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon Rocket and the tree-like humanoid Groot. Nova Corps officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln prison. An inmate, Drax the Destroyer, attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Ronan, who killed his wife and daughter. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the Orb's power. Learning that Gamora intends to sell the Orb to the Collector Taneleer Tivan, Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work together to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the Milano.\n\nRonan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flees to Knowhere. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meets Tivan. Tivan opens the Orb, revealing an Infinity Stone, an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's slave, Carina, grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's collection. Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers, including Gamora's adoptive sister Nebula. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the Orb.\n\nQuill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the Orb to Yondu. Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the Dark Aster, Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar. Hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.\n\nThe Ravagers and Quill's group join the Nova Corps to confront the Dark Aster at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the warship with the Milano. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Drax kills Korath, and Gamora defeats Nebula, who escapes. However, the group finds themselves outmatched by Ronan's power. Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the Dark Aster. The damaged Dark Aster crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, uses it to vaporize Ronan.\n\nQuill gives Yondu a container supposedly containing the Stone and gives the real one to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Kraglin Obfonteri remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, has their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother, a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt Milano along with a potted sapling cut from Groot, which grows into a baby version of him.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Tivan sits in his destroyed archive with two of his living exhibits: a canine cosmonaut and an anthropomorphic duck.[a]\n\nAdditionally, Josh Brolin appears, uncredited, as Thanos through voice acting and performance capture, taking over the role from Damion Poitier.[67][68][69] Sean Gunn stood in for Thanos during filming and portrays Kraglin Obfonteri, Yondu's first mate in the Ravagers.[30] Alexis Denisof reprises his role as Thanos' vizier, \"the Other\", from The Avengers (2012).[70] Ophelia Lovibond plays Carina, the Collector's slave;[71][72] Peter Serafinowicz plays Denarian Garthan Saal, a Nova Corps officer;[73][74] Gregg Henry plays Quill's grandfather;[75] Laura Haddock plays Quill's mother, Meredith;[74][76] Melia Kreiling plays Bereet;[77] Christopher Fairbank plays The Broker;[78] Mikaela Hoover plays Nova Prime's assistant;[79] Marama Corlett plays a pit boss at the bar, The Boot;[80] Emmett J. Scanlan plays a Nova riot guard;[81][82] Alexis Rodney plays Moloka Dar;[83][84] Tom Proctor plays Horuz, a Ravager;[85] and Spencer Wilding plays a prison guard who confiscates Quill's Walkman.[83][86] Canine actor Fred appears as Cosmo.[6] Stephen Blackehart had a supporting role.[87] Naomi Ryan also had a supporting role in the film, though it was cut in the final version.[80] Ralph Ineson has a brief role as a Ravager pilot.[88] Cameos in the film include: James Gunn as a Sakaaran;[6] Stan Lee as a Xandarian Ladies' Man;[6][89] Lloyd Kaufman as an inmate;[90][91] Nathan Fillion as the voice of an inmate;[6][92] Rob Zombie as the voice of the Ravager Navigator;[6] composer Tyler Bates as a Ravager pilot;[93] and Seth Green as the voice of Howard the Duck.[7]\n\nI think anybody ... who would have said that this would make a great main movie would have been laughed off. It's such an unlikely thing to do. So I think it's lovely to work on something and expose its potential to the point where a company like Marvel will say, 'Yes, this makes sense.'\n\nMarvel Studios President Kevin Feige first mentioned Guardians of the Galaxy as a potential film at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con, stating, \"There are some obscure titles, too, like Guardians of the Galaxy. I think they've been revamped recently in a fun way in the [comic] book.\"[95] Feige reiterated that sentiment in a September 2011 issue of Entertainment Weekly, saying, \"There's an opportunity to do a big space epic, which Thor (2011) sort of hints at, in the cosmic side\" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Feige added, should the film be made, it would feature an ensemble of characters, similar to X-Men (2000) and The Avengers (2012).[96]\n\nFeige announced that the film was in active development at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con during the Marvel Studios panel, with an intended release date of August 1, 2014. He said the film's titular team would consist of the characters Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket.[97] Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team.[98] In August 2012, James Gunn entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including future MCU directors Peyton Reed and the duo Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck.[99] The Avengers director Joss Whedon, who signed a deal to creatively consult on all of the films leading up to The Avengers sequel (2015),[100] was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct, saying \"James [Gunn] is what makes me think it will work ... He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart. He loves the raccoon. Needs the raccoon ... He has a very twisted take on it, but it all comes from a real love for the material. It's going to be hard for [the human characters] to keep up\".[101]\n\nNicole Perlman, who was enrolled in Marvel's screenwriting program in 2009,[102] was offered several of their lesser known properties to base a screenplay on.[103] Out of those, Perlman chose Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning's Guardians of the Galaxy, due to her interest in space and science fiction,[103] adding, \"I think [Marvel] were a little taken aback when I chose Guardians, because there were ones that would make a lot more sense if you were a romantic-comedy writer or something like that\".[104] Perlman wrote 10 drafts between 2009 and 2011, in which she tried various combinations of characters for the team, including the original members in the comics, before settling on Abnett and Lanning's run since theirs \"were the most fun\".[105] Early drafts centered on Nova, before Nate Moore, the head of the studios' writing program, suggested it change to Star-Lord.[106] Subsequent drafts saw Star-Lord reimagined to be closer to a Han Solo-type character; the inclusion of 1980s and 1990s music from Perlman's childhood, which would become the 1970s and 1980s pop mixtape in Gunn's later drafts; and the eventual opening scene of the film on a desolate planet that harkened back to a memory Perlman had at Disneyland viewing a drained-out Submarine Voyage.[105] Gunn was brought in in early 2012 to contribute to the script,[104] eventually rewriting the script entirely because \"it didn't work\" for him; he would use the film The Dirty Dozen (1967) as a reference to convey his ideas of the film to Marvel.[107]\n\nGunn later explained that Perlman's draft was very different from the script he used during filming, including a different story, character arcs and no Walkman; he stated, \"In Nicole's script everything is pretty different ... it's not about the same stuff. But that's how the WGA works.\"[108] The 2012 screenplay also had J'son as an emperor and Peter Quill / Star-Lord's father just like in the comic books. When Marvel asked Joss Whedon to revise the script ahead of Age of Ultron, Whedon particularly detested this reveal and suggested Marvel to not make Peter part of royalty;[109] Whedon suggested Gunn to make the story \"weirder\" after reading the early draft.[110] Throughout the writing process, there was some debate on whether keeping Rocket as a member of the Guardians or even featuring the character at all in the film due to concerns that he could come off as \"too cartoonish\", hence why a few drafts excluded the character, but Perlman felt that the character's inclusion was necessary and was happy at Feige letting her keep him in the script due to him being a great Rocket fan.[111] In August 2012, Marvel Studios hired writer Chris McCoy to rewrite Perlman's script,[112] but was not credited in the final film.[61]\n\nGunn revealed that character introductions were the \"hardest scenes to crack\", with Thanos' introduction being the most difficult. He felt that \"having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [MCU] than it was to Guardians of the Galaxy,\" yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without \"[belittling] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan\". To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill \"The Other\", Thanos' vizier, saying, \"I thought that was interesting, because we've had the Other, who's obviously very powerful even in comparison to Loki, and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him. So that I liked, but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn't work so much\".[113] Perlman's original script had Thanos as the main villain of the film, but Whedon asked Gunn if he could not have Thanos as the main antagonist and Gunn agreed, reducing Thanos' role in the plot.[114]\n\nIn September 2012, Gunn confirmed that he had signed on to direct the film and rewrite the script.[115] By the end of November, Joel Edgerton, Jack Huston, Jim Sturgess, and Eddie Redmayne signed deals to test for the role of Peter Quill, as did Lee Pace,[116] which he confirmed a week later in early December.[50] Other actors who were considered for the role included Thor: The Dark World (2013) actor Zachary Levi,[117] Adam Brody,[118] Joseph Gordon-Levitt,[119] Michael Rosenbaum,[120] and John Gallagher Jr.[121] Chris Pratt was cast in the role in February 2013, as part of a multi-film deal that he signed with Marvel.[15][122] Glenn Howerton was Gunn's second choice for the role.[123]\n\nIn January 2013, filming was scheduled to take place at Shepperton Studios in London, United Kingdom,[124] and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in 3D.[125] Victoria Alonso, an executive producer on the film, said that filming would begin in June. She also said that both Rocket Raccoon and Groot would be created through a combination of CGI and motion capture, going on to say that \"You can't do any motion capture with a raccoon—they won't let you put the suit on. But we will do rotomation, probably, for some of the behavior ... we definitely will have performers to emulate what James Gunn will lead to be, the behavior and the performance. He's very clear on where he wants to take the characters.\"[126] In March 2013, Feige discussed Guardians of the Galaxy in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, \"It's much more of a standalone film. It takes place in the same universe. And when we've been on the other side of that universe in other movies, you might see those characteristics in Guardians, but the Avengers are not involved with what's happening out there at this time.\" Feige also stated that 95% of the film would take place in space.[127] In mid-March, Dave Bautista was signed to play Drax the Destroyer.[128] Other actors who had been considered for the role included Isaiah Mustafa, Brian Patrick Wade, Jason Momoa,[128] and Chadwick Boseman.[129] Momoa chose not to continue after auditioning, feeling the character was too similar to other parts he had played in the past, and he did not want to further add to his typecasting as the \"brute\" character.[130] By the following week, sculptor Brian Muir, who sculpted Darth Vader's mask for Star Wars (1977), was revealed to be working on the film.[131]\n\nIn early April 2013, Zoe Saldaña entered into negotiations to star as Gamora in the film, and it was confirmed she had been cast later that month.[71][132] Amanda Seyfried had been offered the role, but declined due to the excessive hours of make-up required for the role, and her uncertainty over the film's commercial viability.[133] Lupita Nyong'o also auditioned for the role.[129] Also in April, Michael Rooker joined the film's cast as Yondu Udonta,[52] and it was announced that Ophelia Lovibond had been cast in a supporting role.[71] By this point in time, Lee Pace was in final negotiations to play the villain of the film.[134] In May, Marvel offered John C. Reilly the role of Rhomann Dey.[135] At the same time, it was disclosed that filmmakers were looking at actors including Hugh Laurie, Alan Rickman, and Ken Watanabe, for another role, and that Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were providing finishing touches to the script.[135] A few days later, Glenn Close was cast as the head of the Nova Corps in the film,[62] followed shortly by the casting of Karen Gillan as the film's lead female villain.[136] By June 2013, Benicio del Toro was cast in the film, as part of a multi-film deal with Marvel Studios.[65] Later in the month, it was confirmed that Reilly had been cast as Rhomann Dey.[60]\n\nSpecial effects makeup designer David White took head and body casts of actors, such as Bautista, to experiment with materials used to create the characters. White said, \"James always pushed for practical and makeup effects. He wanted, like me, to see the real deal there on set.\" White was careful not to use \"modern\" creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different-colored aliens.[137] For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create \"a colorful science-fiction world\", and include elements of 1950s and '60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, as an example of the latter.[138] Science fiction artist Chris Foss inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.[139] The Mass Effect video game series, Flash Gordon, Farscape and Star Wars were primary inspirations for Gunn on the film.[140]\n\nPrincipal photography began around July 6, 2013, in London, United Kingdom,[58] under the working title of Full Tilt.[8] Filming took place at Shepperton Studios and Longcross Studios.[124][141] Later in July, Gunn and the film's cast flew from London to attend San Diego Comic-Con, where it was revealed that Pace would play Ronan the Accuser, Gillan would be Nebula, del Toro as the Collector, and that Djimon Hounsou had been cast as Korath.[58][61] Close was later revealed to play Nova Prime Irani Rael.[9][61] Also at San Diego Comic-Con, Feige stated that Thanos would be a part of the film as the \"mastermind\".[142] On August 11, 2013, filming began at London's Millennium Bridge,[143] which was selected as a double for Xandar.[24] In August 2013, Marvel announced that Bradley Cooper would voice Rocket.[38] On September 3, 2013, Gunn said that filming was \"a little over half[way]\" complete.[144] Also in September, Vin Diesel stated that he was voicing Groot.[28] However, Marvel did not confirm Diesel's involvement in the film at the time.[43][44][145] On October 12, 2013, Gunn announced on social media that filming had completed.[146]\n\nDirector of photography Ben Davis used Arri Alexa XT cameras for the film, saying, \"I'm traditionally a photochemical fan, but going with the digital format was the right way for this movie ... the Alexa [provided] the right look for this particular film\". During the opening scenes in the 1980s, Davis chose JDC Cooke Xtal (Crystal) Express anamorphic prime lenses because they \"had more anamorphic artifacts and aberrations, which [he] felt added something\". Davis used spherical Panavision Primos for the rest of the film. Additionally, Davis worked closely with production designer Charles Wood to achieve the correct lighting looks for each scene.[141] Dealing with two fully CGI characters forced Davis to shoot scenes multiple times, usually once with the references for the characters and once without them in the shot.[147]\n\nGunn revealed that his brother, Sean Gunn, took on multiple roles during the filming process, such as standing in for Rocket, which he noted was beneficial for the other actors, including Saldaña, Pratt, and Bautista, who responded positively to Sean and his on-set performances.[30] Sean was first hired to play Kraglin Obfonteri, but James hired him as a stand-in on set for Rocket because he knew he could trust in him until they could figure out how to portray Rocket, though they knew Sean would not voice the character, with Cooper being cast to voice Rocket very late in development.[148] Special effects makeup designer David White made two life-size versions of Rocket and a bust of Groot as aids for visual effects, with White saying, \"it gives [the filmmakers] a good indication of where visual effects needs to pick up and whether Rocket can actually reach certain things or use certain devices\".[31] These busts were also used to see how the on-set lighting would affect the characters, to assist with the visual effects lighting process.[31]\n\nIn January 2015, Disney revealed that the film came in \"slightly over the agreed budget\" at $232.3 million, with Disney receiving a rebate of $36.4 million from the British government.[2] It was previously estimated to have had a $170 million budget.[149]\n\nIn November 2013, Gunn stated that he attempted to use as many practical effects as possible while filming to aid the use of CGI and motion capture during post-production, saying, \"Our sets are enormous. We have a prison that is 350,000 pounds of steel. Anybody who knows me knows I love the mix of practical and CGI effects ... I can't wait for people to see it, because it's astonishingly beautiful.\"[150] After the release of Thor: The Dark World, Feige stated that the Infinity Stones would be a focus in the film, as well as going forward into the Phase Three slate of films within the MCU.[151] Gunn originally wrote the scene of the Collector explaining about the origins of the Infinity Stones in one hour and a half, only to then be told by Marvel Studios that they were incidentally thinking about including the Power Stone in his film, an idea that Gunn found cool to use, thus subsequent MCU filmmakers involved in the long-planned story of Avengers: Infinity War (2018) based themselves on Gunn's backstory for the Stones.[152] In a separate interview for The Dark World in November, Feige added that a third, unknown Infinity Stone would be seen in the film,[153] referred to as the \"Power Stone\" by the Collector.[154][155] The mid-credits scene in The Dark World revealed Lovibond's role as the Collector's slave, later named Carina.[72] In December 2013, Marvel confirmed that Diesel would voice Groot.[156]\n\nA few weeks of additional filming, involving the film's main cast and crew, occurred in March 2014 at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California.[157][158][159] In April 2014, Gunn described Thanos as the \"head of the snake\" in the film, and confirmed he would appear via performance capture.[11] In May 2014, Gunn stated that the film features an \"enormous\" amount of smaller and minor characters from the Marvel Universe, adding that he felt the film had the most characters overall of any Marvel Studios film to date.[160] Costume supervisor Dan Grace added to this by saying, \"We really, really get the feeling of the scale and scope of the galaxy. We visit five planets, we see a hundred different races.\" The film introduces the alien race Sakaaran, who act as Ronan's mercenaries, as a replacement to the Badoon, as the Badoon film rights belonged to 20th Century Fox.[47]\n\nBy the end of May, Josh Brolin was revealed as the voice of Thanos,[67][68] with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character.[69] Whedon assisted Gunn as well in casting Brolin.[161] Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula.[154] In June 2014, Feige added that Thanos and his followers are \"the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into Avengers films in the future.\"[162] On casting Brolin, Feige said,\n\nWe reached out to him and it was one of those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it's very nice, where he was totally intrigued. He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit. I spoke to him on the phone a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [Whedon] who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of Avengers. Then we shot him and recorded for it.[69]\nOn July 7, 2014, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed work on the film.[163] In August, regarding the post-credit scene, Gunn revealed that the scene did not involve Howard the Duck when it was originally filmed, rather he was added during post-production,[164] a decision made by \"some combination of [Gunn] and the editor Fred Raskin\".[80] As the decision to add the character was made late in the post-production process, he had to be designed that day, before being handed off to Sony Pictures Imageworks to animate. Also in August, regarding the pre-credit scene of Baby Groot dancing, Gunn stated that he himself danced to provide motion reference for the animators, and that the decision was made to place the scene before the credits, rather than during or after them, because of positive responses from a test audience, which made Marvel and Gunn feel that they did not want \"people walking out and missing this thing\".[80] Another late change halfway in production came when Marvel decided that the Reality Stone would be red in The Dark World. Because the Power Stone was originally meant to be red as well, Gunn was asked to change its color from red to purple, which he accepted as, by his own admission, liked that color more.[165] Marvel used design firm Sarofsky once again for the film's title sequences, after liking their work for Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014). Sarofsky developed a custom typeface based on the font used in the teaser posters for the opening credits, which was tinted orange to offer a better contrast to the film's blue and gray imagery. One of the typography solutions offered before the final product wound up being repurposed as the locator cards seen throughout the film.[166]\n\nThe film featured 2,750 visual effects shots,[168] which make up approximately 90% of the film.[167] The visual effects were created by: Moving Picture Company (MPC), who worked on creating Groot, as well as Morag, Xandar, the Dark Aster and the final battle on Xandar;[167] Framestore, who worked on creating Rocket, extending the Kyln prison set and constructing Knowhere;[167][169] Luma Pictures, who worked on Thanos;[167] Method Studios, who worked on creating the Orb opening and revealing its powers, as well as the holographic displays at the Nova Corps command center;[167] Lola VFX; Cantina Creative; Sony Pictures Imageworks, who worked on Howard the Duck and creating the Dark Aster shots with MPC;[80][167] CoSA VFX; Secret Lab; Rise Visual Effects Studios; and Technicolor VFX.[170][171] Pre- and post-visualizations were done by Proof and The Third Floor, with Proof also contributing to the creation of Rocket and Groot.[167]\n\nProducer Nik Korda noted how helpful it was to have Sean Gunn and Krystian Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set, as it provided references for lighting and on-set performances to the animators.[31] When creating Groot, MPC realized early on that his eyes would be essential in maintaining the character's human qualities, as his face couldn't move in the way that humans' do. MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, \"When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections—trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place—trying to make them strange and look more human.\"[167] Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.[167]\n\nOne of the major challenges for Framestore in creating Rocket was his fur. Framestore's Rachel Williams explained that, since \"raccoon fur is made up from a layer of short fine hair and a layer of longer thicker hairs\", these layers were separated and animated individually, removing the need to use \"guide hairs\" to control the movements of thick sections of fur.[167] Framestore and MPC worked closely sharing assets, to ensure shots of Rocket at MPC would match the Rocket created by Framestore, and vice versa for when Groot was needed by the other studio.[167]\n\nTo give Thanos \"the performance and the weight that he deserved\", Luma Pictures created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully CG character, using his \"eyes, some of his cheek, how his muscles move when he talks\". The character's large jaw, and the deep grooves that run down his face, had \"to be carefully planned out with the movement of his face.\"[167]\n\nIn August 2013, Gunn revealed that Tyler Bates would be composing the film's score. Gunn stated that Bates would write some of the score first so that he can film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film.[172] In February 2014, Gunn revealed that the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as \"Hooked on a Feeling\", on a mixtape in Quill's Walkman, which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost.[173] In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the '60s and '70s were \"cultural reference points\", saying, \"It's striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [Quill] is a real person from planet Earth who's just like you and me. Except that he's in this big outer space adventure.\"[160]\n\nWhen choosing the songs, Gunn revealed he \"started the process by reading the Billboard charts for all of the top hits of the '70s\", downloading \"a few hundred\" songs that were \"semi-familiar—ones you recognize but might not be able to name off the top of your head\" and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he \"would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house—sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best.\"[174] Most of the songs were played on set to help \"the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot\", with David Bowie's \"Moonage Daydream\" the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in mind; however, once Gunn discovered \"Come and Get Your Love\", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a \"better fit.\"[174]\n\nThree albums were released by Hollywood Records on July 29, 2014: The film's score, Guardians of the Galaxy (Original Score), which features the music composed by Bates for the film;[175] Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), which comprises the twelve songs from Quill's mixtape; and a deluxe edition featuring both albums.[176] By August 2014, the album which mirrored Quill's mixtape had reached the top of the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart.[177] Hollywood Records also released a cassette version of the Awesome Mix Vol. 1 soundtrack on November 28, 2014, as an exclusive to Record Store Day participants. The cassette, which is the first cassette Disney Music Group has released since 2003, comes with a digital download version of the album.[178]\n\nAt Disney's D23 Expo in August 2013, Feige presented footage first revealed at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2013.[179] The first trailer for the film debuted on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on February 18, 2014, with a special introduction by Chris Pratt.[10] The Los Angeles Times said the trailer delivered \"some spirited alien action, with exploding spaceships and muscled bad guys, not to mention a few purely comedic moments,\" while spotlighting \"a number of the offbeat characters.\"[180] Total Film noted the similarity of the trailer's opening clip to the 1981 film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, which Gunn stated was a big influence for Guardians,[181] and made note of the \"edgy\" humor used throughout.[182] Total Film also noted the similarity of the trailer to the one debuted at Comic-Con and D23, with a few new shots featuring Nebula and the Collector.[183][184] Social media response to the trailer was strong, with 88,000 mentions across Twitter, Facebook and various blogs in a 12-hour period. Those numbers were comparable to trailers for other superhero films like Man of Steel and The Amazing Spider-Man 2, and noteworthy for the late night-time period in which it premiered.[185] The trailer received 22.8 million views in the 24 hours after it debuted.[186] After the debut of the trailer, Blue Swede's version of \"Hooked on a Feeling\", which was prominently used throughout the trailer, went up 700% in sales the following day.[187] The line from Serafinowicz's character, \"What a bunch of a-holes\", was only intended to be featured in the trailers, but due to its positive reception, was included in the final cut of the film.[80] Gunn noted that a different teaser was almost released \"that was very cheesy [and] sold the movie as something different than what it was\", as it tested better than the version that was ultimately released. Gunn credited the marketing teams at Marvel and Disney for having faith in the latter version, despite how it tested, over choosing the version that would have mis-marketed the film.[188]\n\nIn March 2014, the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode \"T.A.H.I.T.I.\" introduced the Kree race to the MCU, which began a storyline that recurs throughout the series and involves finding a hidden Kree city.[189][190] Also in March, ABC aired a one-hour television special titled, Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe, which included a sneak peek of Guardians of the Galaxy.[191] Starting in April 2014, a two-part comic was released, titled Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Prelude. Written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, with art by Wellington Alves, the first issue focused on the background of Nebula and her bond with Thanos; the second issue featured the adventures of Rocket and Groot before they join forces with the other Guardians.[192] In June 2014, Mike Pasciullo, senior VP of Marvel Studios, described the marketing approach for Guardians of the Galaxy by saying that Marvel had \"built a robust marketing program for the theatrical release that carefully integrates traditional advertising, social media, digital marketing, strategic promotional partnerships, organic entertainment integrations [and] publicity.\"[193]\n\nIn July 2014, Marvel launched a viral marketing campaign for the film called \"Galaxy Getaways\", a fictional travel website that allows users to book passage to some of the planets depicted in the film, including Xandar, Morag, and Knowhere.[194] Beginning July 4, 2014, a sneak peek of the film was presented at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios in the Magic Eye and ABC Sound Studio theaters, respectively.[195] Approximately 14 minutes of the film was screened on July 7, 2014, in IMAX 3D in the United States, and 3D theaters and IMAX 3D in Canada, along with two trailers.[196][197] The screening was met with positive reviews, praising the humor, the 3D, and IMAX conversion, and Cooper's portrayal of Rocket.[197][198][199][200] However, it was criticized for beginning partway through the film, not allowing viewers to easily acclimate to the film's tone,[198][201] and for how the general audience might respond to a film within the MCU without established characters making appearances.[201]\n\nOn July 12, 2014, Gunn and the actors from the film promoted Guardians of the Galaxy at the Lido 8 Cineplex in Singapore.[202] On July 17, 2014, Disney Interactive released an action RPG video game titled Guardians of the Galaxy: The Universal Weapon for iOS, Android and Windows devices.[203] The game's original story was written by Dan Abnett, and was meant to complement the film.[204] On July 21, Pratt, Saldaña, Bautista, Diesel, and Cooper appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! to promote the film and debut some additional exclusive content.[205] On July 29, Pratt and Saldaña rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange as part of the film's marketing strategy.[206]\n\nOn August 14, Marvel released the scene of Groot dancing,[207] which was shortly followed by an announcement from Funko that they were releasing a toy \"Dancing Groot\". The Hollywood Reporter noted that the quick release of the scene from Marvel two weeks after the film's theatrical release, along with the rush announcement from Funko, indicated the popularity of both the character and the scene.[208] The scene also produced the word \"grooting\", coined by Michael Rooker, in which a person dances similar to Groot, with the word entering the social media lexicon.[209] Also in August, Marvel held a special screening of the film at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, where Pratt dressed as Star-Lord to entertain the patients.[210]\n\nIn June 2012, Marvel filed eleven trademark applications for Guardians of the Galaxy, covering a variety of consumer products, from video games to cosmetics.[211] Disney Consumer Products partnered with Mad Engine, C-Life, New Era, Hasbro, Disguise, Rubies, Sideshow Collectibles, Lego, KIDdesigns, iHome, Funko, Freeze, Fast Forward, and Innovative Designs to produce merchandise for the film, with releases starting in June 2014.[193][212][213][214] Mad Engine and C-Life were partnered as the core apparel outfitters, producing a line of T-shirts and fleece jackets, while New Era produced headwear and hats.[212] Hasbro produced toys for the film; Disguise and Rubies produced the costumes; and Sideshow Collectibles was given charge of the collectibles.[193][212] Lego announced three toy sets based on scenes from the film,[213] while iHome created character speakers, Funko made vinyl bobbleheads, Freeze crafted 1980s-inspired apparel, and backpacks and stationery were made by Fast Forward and Innovative Designs.[193] Despite first films in a potential new franchise usually being off-limits to licensees, Marvel used Iron Man's success as evidence of unknown characters becoming hits with audiences to attract partnerships. Licensees embraced Rocket as the film's potential breakout character, with Drax and Gamora being used for older demographics; Star-Lord's obsession with 1980s nostalgia, including his \"Awesome Mix Vo. 1\" cassette, has also served as a basis for tie-in products.[193] In August 2014, Funko announced a toy based on \"Dancing Groot\",[208] while in October 2014, Marvel and KID designs announced a replica of dancing Groot, for release in December 2014.[215]\n\nIn December 2014, Disney made a second marketing push, to coincide with the film's home media release with additional merchandise. Merchandise partners included: KID designs with its replica dancing Groot; Funko's Fabrikations line with a plush Rocket; Mattel's Hot Wheels character cars; C-Life, Hybrid-Jem Sportswear, Freeze, MZ Berger, Accutime, AME and Her Universe with apparel; ThinkGeek with jewelry and watches; American Greetings with cards; Jay Franco with homegoods; and Vandor with drinkware. Additional partners included Mad Engine, Just Play, and Dragon Models. Paul Gitter, senior vice-president of Marvel licensing at Disney Consumer Products said, \"The demand for Guardians of the Galaxy merchandise has been truly out of this world. Our merchandising and retail partners are doing a tremendous job of providing creative and innovative ways for fans to continue interacting with these popular characters and showcase their fandom year round.\"[216]\n\nThe world premiere of Guardians of the Galaxy was held on July 21, 2014, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles.[205][217] The film was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on July 31, 2014,[160] and in the United States on August 1,[97] in 3D and IMAX 3D.[125][218] The film was released in 4,080 theaters in the United States, making it the widest August release, breaking the five-year record held by G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (4,007 theaters). The breakdown of venues was: 354 IMAX screens, 3,200 3D screens, 350 large format screens, and 240 D-Box screens.[219] In its sixth weekend, Guardians of the Galaxy was playing in 69 territories, its most.[220] The film is part of Phase Two of the MCU.[221]\n\nIn June 2014, Gunn stated that the film had always been planned as a 3D film, and \"Unlike many directors, I've been actively involved with converting every shot to 3D, making sure it works perfectly for the story and the film, making sure it's spectacular and immersive without being silly, distracting, or overly showy.\" Gunn also revealed that the IMAX 3D version would include shifting aspect ratios, to make the viewing experience \"even fuller and more encompassing. I've personally chosen all the places where the changes occur ... The changing aspect ratios in this case are actually a part of the storytelling.\"[222] In July 2014, Gunn revealed that there were multiple scenes he had cut from the film, and he was investigating how to release them, either in an extended cut of the film, or as bonus features on the film's home media release.[69]\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy was released for digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on November 18, 2014, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, and DVD on November 24, 2014, in the United Kingdom and on December 9 in the United States.[223][224] The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, and an exclusive preview of Avengers: Age of Ultron.[224] As of October 4, 2015[update], the film has earned over $118 million in sales in the US.[225]\n\nThe film was also included in the 13-disc box set, titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection\", which includes all of the Phase Two films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was released on December 8, 2015.[226] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[227]\n\n\"We wanted to do a space movie, and we loved the Guardians comics. Just the ridiculous pairing of a tree and a raccoon. It was before Star Wars came back with a vengeance. It was like, \"Let's try a big space movie, the kind of which hasn't been around for a while.\" The audience is following us to these places. The success of Ant-Man and Doctor Strange helped us go, \"Hey, the audience is with us,\" and Guardians is probably the best example of how far they [the audience] are willing to go.\"\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy earned $333.7 million in North America and an estimated $439.6 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $773.3 million.[3] The film became the third-highest-grossing film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, behind The Avengers and Iron Man 3.[229] It was the third-highest-grossing 2014 film (behind Transformers: Age of Extinction and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies) and the highest-grossing superhero film of 2014.[2][230][231] It had a worldwide opening weekend of $160.7 million.[232] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $204.2 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it fifth on their list of 2014's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[233]\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy earned $11.2 million on its Thursday night pre-opening, surpassing Captain America: The Winter Soldier's gross ($10.2 million) for the biggest Thursday evening start for a movie in 2014.[234] IMAX accounted for 17% of the total gross ($1.9 million), which was the biggest August pre-release in IMAX format.[219] On its opening day, the film earned $37.8 million, including the Thursday night earnings.[235] Guardians of the Galaxy was the number one movie during its opening weekend and grossed $94.3 million, setting an August weekend record, surpassing The Bourne Ultimatum.[236] During the opening weekend, IMAX earnings amounted to $11.7 million and 3-D showings accounted for 45% of ticket sales. The film's success was partially attributed to its appeal to both genders: the opening-weekend audience was 44% female, which is the biggest proportion ever for a MCU film; 55% of the opening-weekend audience was over the age of 25.[236]\n\nAlthough the film fell to second place in its second and third weekends, behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,[237][238] the film was number one in its fourth, fifth, and sixth weekend.[239][240][241] By doing so, it became the first film in 2014 to top the domestic box office in non-consecutive weeks,[239] the first film of the summer (May–August) to be the number one film in three weekends[242] and the first MCU film to be the top film for four weeks, surpassing Captain America: The Winter Soldier and The Avengers, both of which were number one for three weeks, and tied The Dark Knight for the most weeks at number one among comic book-based films.[243] Phil Contrino, vice president and chief analyst of BoxOffice.com felt Guardians success was \"unconventional\" and was \"shattering expectations\".[240] The film remained in the top 10 for ten weekends.[244]\n\nThe film was the top-grossing film of summer 2014,[245][246] first of 2014 to pass $300 million for its domestic gross,[247] and was the third-highest-grossing domestic film of 2014 (behind American Sniper and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1).[248] The film was said to have \"injected life\" into an otherwise lower-than-normal summer box office.[240][246][249]\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy was released in 42 international markets and grossed $66.4 million on its opening weekend. The biggest debuts came from Russia ($13 million), the United Kingdom ($10.8 million), Mexico ($6.5 million), Brazil ($6.5 million), and South Korea ($4.7 million).[232] The film topped the weekend box office two times, in its first and second weekends.[232][250] In its eleventh weekend, the film opened in China, earning $29.8 million, its largest, and became the third-highest opening in the country for any Disney release, behind Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and was an all-time industry record opening in October.[251] The following weekend saw an additional $21.3 million from China, making China the highest-grossing market with $69 million.[229] The film's three biggest markets in total earnings were: China ($96.5 million), the UK ($47.4 million), and Russia ($37.5 million).[3]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 92%, with an average score of 7.8/10, based on 336 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Guardians of the Galaxy is just as irreverent as fans of the frequently zany Marvel comic would expect—as well as funny, thrilling, full of heart, and packed with visual splendor.\"[252] Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[253] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale,[254] while earning an \"A+\" among under-18 and 25- to 34-year-old viewers.[255]\n\nScott Foundas of Variety said \"James Gunn's presumptive franchise-starter is overlong, overstuffed, and sometimes too eager to please, but the cheeky comic tone keeps things buoyant—as does Chris Pratt's winning performance\", and praised the film's look created by cinematographer Ben Davis, production designer Charles Wood, and special effects makeup designer David White.[170] Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter also praised the film's look, and felt \"A well-matched ensemble rises to the challenge of launching a heroic origin film with distinctive style, abundant thrills, and no shortage of humor.\"[256] The Daily Telegraph's Robbie Collin said, \"A brand new summer family blockbuster this may be, but it plays by old, half-forgotten rules; trimming out the clutter and cross-referencing for snappy, streamlined, Saturday-cartoon fun\".[257] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, \"Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're not quite sure what's going on, the scruffy Guardians is irreverent in a way that can bring the first Star Wars to mind, in part because it has some of the most unconventional heroes this side of the Mos Eisley cantina.\"[258] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, \"While Guardians takes you down one after another crazy narrative turn, it also pulls you into—and, for the most part, keeps you in—a fully realized other world.\"[259] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said, \"Guardians of the Galaxy is a late summer treat—a mostly lighthearted and self-referential comic-book movie with loads of whiz-bang action, some laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of surprisingly beautiful and touching scenes as well,\" calling it \"a refreshing confection of entertainment.\"[260]\n\nJake Coyle of the Associated Press was more critical of the film, calling it \"terribly overstuffed and many of the jokes get drowned out by the special effects ... The pervasive movie references detract from the stab at freshness, and Guardians depends all too much on the whimsy of '70s anthems for an original beat.\" He also felt that Close, Reilly, and del Toro were underused in the film.[261] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \"In place of wit, Guardians offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it. Everyone is clearly working, but nothing is really happening–and yet the effort is so evident that there's an impulse to reward it.\"[262] The film received mixed reviews in China, according to state media outlet China Daily, where viewers complained that the film's \"poor subtitle translation not only spoiled the fun of watching it, but also made it difficult to understand its humor.\"[263] Jim Starlin, creator of Drax, Gamora, and Thanos, said it \"might be Marvel's best movie yet\".[264] Director Steven Spielberg said that the film was the superhero film \"that impressed [him] most\" as it does \"not take itself too seriously.\" He felt he had \"seen something new in [superhero] movies [from the film], without any cynicism, or fear of being dark when needed.\"[265]\n\nIn 2017, Guardians of the Galaxy was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in Empire magazine's poll of The 100 Greatest Movies, as the highest MCU film on the list.[266]\n\nAt the 87th Academy Awards, Guardians of the Galaxy received nominations for Best Makeup and Hairstyling and Best Visual Effects.[267] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award,[268] two British Academy Film Awards,[269] and five Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two).[270]\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was released on May 5, 2017, again written and directed by James Gunn.[271] Pratt, Saldaña, Bautista, Diesel, Cooper, Rooker, Gillan, and Sean Gunn all reprise their roles in the film,[272] and are joined by Pom Klementieff as Mantis,[5][273] Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha, Chris Sullivan as Taserface, and Kurt Russell as Quill's father Ego.[5][272]\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special is a Marvel Studios Special Presentation that was released on Disney+ on November 25, 2022,[274][275] with Gunn writing and directing.[276] Pratt, Bautista, Diesel, Cooper, Gillan, Klementieff, Rooker, and Sean Gunn reprise their roles in the special,[277] which is set before the events of Vol. 3.[278]\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was released on May 5, 2023,[279] with Gunn returning to write and direct.[280][281] Pratt, Saldaña, Bautista, Diesel, Cooper,[282] Gillan,[283] Klementieff,[284] and Sean Gunn reprise their roles in the film,[45] and are joined by Will Poulter as Adam Warlock,[285] Maria Bakalova as Cosmo the Spacedog, and Chukwudi Iwuji as Rocket's creator, the High Evolutionary.\n"

        "content": "\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to The Avengers (2012) and the 11th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by Joss Whedon, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Cobie Smulders, Anthony Mackie, Hayley Atwell, Idris Elba, Linda Cardellini, Stellan Skarsgård, James Spader, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, the Avengers fight Ultron (Spader)—an artificial intelligence created by Tony Stark (Downey) and Bruce Banner (Ruffalo)—who plans to bring about world peace by causing human extinction.\n\nThe sequel was announced in May 2012 after the successful release of The Avengers, with Whedon set to return as writer and director in August. Whedon updated Ultron's origin for the film to involve the MCU's Avengers team and introduced the characters Pietro (Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda Maximoff (Olsen), to whom Marvel shared the rights with 20th Century Fox. Casting began in June 2013 with Downey re-signing. Second unit filming began in February 2014 in South Africa, with principal photography taking place between March and August, primarily at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England. Additional footage was filmed in Italy, South Korea, Bangladesh, the state of New York, and around England. With an estimated net production budget of $365 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 13, 2015, and was released in the United States on May 1, as part of Phase Two of the MCU. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $1.4 billion worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time during its run. Two sequels have been released: Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019).\n\nIn the Eastern European country of Sokovia, the Avengers—Tony Stark, Thor, Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton—raid a Hydra facility commanded by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, who has experimented on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki. They meet two of Strucker's test subjects—twins Pietro (superhuman speed) and Wanda Maximoff (telepathic and telekinetic abilities)—and apprehend Strucker while Stark retrieves Loki's scepter.\n\nStark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem and secretly use it to complete Stark's \"Ultron\" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's AI J.A.R.V.I.S. and attacks the Avengers at their headquarters. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. Having killed Strucker, he recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons and goes to the base of arms dealer Ulysses Klaue in Johannesburg to get vibranium. The Avengers attack Ultron and the Maximoffs, but Wanda subdues them with haunting visions, causing Banner to turn into the Hulk and rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.[a]\n\nA worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding at Barton's farmhouse. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig on the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while Nick Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron uses Loki's scepter to enslave the team's friend Helen Cho. They use her synthetic-tissue technology, vibranium, and the scepter's gem to craft a new body. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton fight Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff. The Avengers fight among themselves when Stark and Banner secretly upload J.A.R.V.I.S.—who is still working after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet—into the synthetic body.\n\nThor returns to help activate the body, based on his vision that the gem on its brow is the Mind Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence. This \"Vision\" earns their trust by being worthy of lifting Thor's hammer, Mjölnir. Vision and the Maximoffs go with the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff, who awakens the Hulk for the battle. The Avengers fight Ultron's army while Fury arrives in a Helicarrier with Maria Hill, James Rhodes, and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to evacuate civilians.\n\nPietro dies when he shields Barton from gunfire, and a vengeful Wanda abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body, which allows one of his drones to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. In the aftermath, the Hulk, unwilling to endanger Romanoff by being with her, departs in a Quinjet, while Vision confronts and destroys Ultron's last remaining body. Later, with the Avengers having established a new base run by Fury, Hill, Cho, and Selvig, Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent events. As Stark leaves and Barton retires, Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train new Avengers: Rhodes, Vision, Sam Wilson, and Wanda.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Thanos dons a gauntlet[b] and vows to retrieve the Infinity Stones himself.\n\nThomas Kretschmann and Henry Goodman reprise their roles as Baron Wolfgang von Strucker and Dr. List,[76][77] Hydra leaders who specialize in human experimentation, advanced robotics, and artificial intelligence from Captain America: The Winter Soldier.[65] Claudia Kim portrays Helen Cho, a world-renowned geneticist who helps the Avengers from her office in Seoul;[65][78] Andy Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue, a South-African black-market arms dealer, smuggler and gangster who is a former acquaintance from Stark's weapons-dealing days;[79][65][80] and Julie Delpy appears as Madame B., who mentored Black Widow into becoming an assassin.[81] Kerry Condon voices the artificial intelligence F.R.I.D.A.Y., a replacement for J.A.R.V.I.S.,[82] while Spader also voices Stark's Iron Legion droids.[83] Josh Brolin makes an uncredited appearance during the mid-credits scene as Thanos, reprising his role from Guardians of the Galaxy (2014).[84] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance in the film as a military veteran who attends the Avengers' victory party.[85] Tom Hiddleston was to reprise his role of Loki, but his scenes did not make the theatrical cut of the film.[86]\n\n\"I have to make my movie assuming that people will only have seen the first one, or possibly not even seen the first one. I can't assume that everybody went to see Thor [The Dark World], Captain America [The Winter Soldier], and Iron Man [3] in-between. I have to go from one movie to the next and be true to what's happened, but not be slavish to it [...] The model I'm always trying to build from, my guiding star, is The Godfather Part II where a ton has happened in-between and it's a very different movie [from The Godfather], but you don't need any information: it's there in the film.\"\n\nIn October 2011, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said the studio was beginning to look at their Phase Two films, which would start with Iron Man 3 and would culminate in a second Avengers film.[88] In March 2012, Joss Whedon, director of the first film, stated that he would want a sequel to be more small, personal, and painful; that is \"not just a rehash of what seemed to work the first time\", and with a theme full of originality to itself.[89] Despite the production of the film becoming increasingly wider in scope, Feige maintained that this was not their intention, always looking to see where the team wanted to take the characters, over how to make it bigger than The Avengers.[90] At the premiere of The Avengers, Feige said the studio had an option for Whedon to return as director.[91] In May 2012, after the successful release of the first film, the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger announced a sequel was in development.[92] Most of the film's cast members were under contract to potentially appear in the sequel; however, Robert Downey Jr. was not, as his four-picture deal with Marvel expired after Iron Man 3.[93]\n\nAt the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, Whedon said he was undecided about directing.[94] However, in August 2012, Iger announced that Whedon would return to write and direct the sequel and develop the Marvel television series, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., for ABC.[95] Later in the month, Disney set a May 1, 2015, release date.[96] Whedon said his return for a sequel \"wasn't a tough decision\"; he thought it was \"not going to happen\", but realized he \"desperately wanted to say more about these characters\" when he started considering it.[97] Whedon said that they intended for the film's production to not be as rushed as the first one.[98] In December 2012, Whedon stated that he had completed an outline for the film.[99] In March 2013, Whedon said that he looked to The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and The Godfather Part II (1974) as inspirations.[100]\n\nFeige revealed that Captain Marvel, who starred in her own MCU film in 2019, appeared in an early draft of the screenplay, but was removed since the character had not yet been cast, saying, \"It didn't feel like the time. We didn't want to introduce her fully formed flying in a costume before you knew who she was or how she came to be.\"[101] Whedon went so far as to shoot visual effects plates for Captain Marvel to fly into Avengers Headquarters at the end of the film; those shots were reused; however, for Scarlet Witch instead.[102] Feige also revealed that an early draft of the script had Hulk's Quinjet detected near Saturn at the end of the film, but it was finally decided to keep it Earth-based and leave his fate ambiguous in order to dispel rumors that a film based on the \"Planet Hulk\" comic storyline was in development, which Marvel Studios had no plans to adapt at the time. Marvel would later decide to adapt \"Planet Hulk\" for the film Thor: Ragnarok (2017), in which the Hulk is retroactively revealed to have left Earth after the events of Age of Ultron.[103]\n\nBy April 2013, filming was scheduled to begin in early 2014 at Shepperton Studios in England.[104] At the Hollywood, Los Angeles, premiere of Iron Man 3, Whedon said that he had completed a draft of the script, started the storyboard process, and met with actors. Whedon also mentioned that he wrote with Downey in mind and included a \"brother/sister act\" from the comic books,[105] later confirming that he was referring to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch.[106][107] Whedon explained his rationale for including the characters in the film that \"their powers are very visually interesting\", with problems which Whedon \"had on the first one\" for strong powers; those powers are superspeed, and spells and telekinesis, respectively, which \"they can do that will help sort of keep it fresh\",[108] though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that.[70] Whedon stated that the twins allowed him to add more conflict, which do not like the United States and the Avengers, and \"the Avengers are like a world power, and not everybody's on board with the Avengers coming in and starting fights, even in the name of justice.\"[39] Because Marvel Studios shared the film rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch with 20th Century Fox and had to avoid conflict with Fox's X-Men films, Whedon introduced two important characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe completely on his terms for the first time, which allowed him to connect their origin stories to the universe that they created and avoid the concept of mutants.[39] Whedon relished at the storytelling opportunities by introducing a character with telepathic powers, explaining, \"it meant we could spend a little time inside the Avengers' heads—either their past or their impressions of what's going on, or their fears, or all of the above.\"[39] By May, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film.[109] A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film.[12]\n\nAt the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Whedon announced the film would be subtitled Age of Ultron.[110] Despite the subtitle, the film is not based on the 2013 comic book miniseries Age of Ultron. Feige explained that they simply liked the title Age of Ultron but the plot was taken from decades of Avengers story arcs.[111] Whedon added that Ultron's origin would differ from his comics roots, and that Hank Pym would not be involved with Ultron's creation. Whedon disclosed that Edgar Wright had rights to the character first through his inclusion in Ant-Man, which was already in development. He also thought that Ultron needed to be conceived through the Avengers and since they already had Tony Stark and Bruce Banner on the team, it would not make sense to bring in a third scientist.[112] Whedon also said the film would have a darker tone due to Ultron's involvement.[113] The title of the film came as a surprise to many fans who were expecting Thanos, the mastermind behind the events of the first film, to be the main villain in the sequel, with Whedon saying, \"Thanos was never meant to be the next villain. He's always been the overlord of villainy and darkness.\"[114] Commenting on finding the right balance between technology- and fantasy-based heroes in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Feige explained that Iron Man is a technology-based hero, and his films are always based on those; Thor is a fantasy-based hero introduced in the 2011 film of the same name, which also introduces Asgard, a fantastical realm in \"the more reality-based MCU\"; and finally, Ultron is \"clearly [...] come[s] out of technology,\" using tools that established in the franchise to construct Age of Ultron storyline.[115]\n\nCasting continued into August 2013, with the announcement that James Spader would play Ultron.[63] In November, Marvel confirmed that Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson would play the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, respectively.[36] Taylor-Johnson had been in negotiations since as early as June,[116][117][118] while Olsen's potential involvement was first reported in August.[119][120] By the end of the year, Mark Ruffalo,[17] Chris Evans,[23] Samuel L. Jackson,[74] Chris Hemsworth,[14] Scarlett Johansson,[27] Jeremy Renner,[32] and Cobie Smulders[49] were confirmed to be returning to their roles from the first film, and Don Cheadle, who portrayed James Rhodes in the Iron Man films, had committed to a part in the film.[34] In the early months of 2014, Thomas Kretschmann was cast as Baron Wolfgang von Strucker,[76] Claudia Kim was cast in an unspecified role,[121] and Paul Bettany, who voiced J.A.R.V.I.S. in previous MCU films, was cast as the Vision.[44] Whedon said \"juggling\" all the characters in the film was \"a nightmare\"; he explained: \"They're very disparate characters. The joy of the Avengers is they really don't belong in the same room. It's not like the X-Men, who are all tortured by the same thing and have similar costumes. These guys are just all over the place. And so it's tough. Honestly, this is as tough as anything I've ever done.\"[122]\n\nOn January 24, 2014, the Forte di Bard Association announced that filming would take place at Fort Bard in the Aosta Valley region of Italy in March 2014, as well as other locations in Aosta Valley including Aosta, Bard, Donnas, Pont-Saint-Martin, and Verrès.[123] The next month, the Gauteng Film Commission announced that action sequences would be filmed in Johannesburg, South Africa, and other locations in Gauteng, beginning in mid-February.[124] A few weeks later Marvel announced that portions of the film would be shot in South Korea. Feige cited the nation's \"cutting-edge technology, beautiful landscapes and spectacular architecture\" as ideal for the film.[125] The nation's capital, Seoul, and Seoul's surrounding province, Gyeonggi, were selected as filming locations, with South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism reimbursing up to 30% of the studio's expenditures, as part of a state-funded incentive program.[121]\n\nFilming began on Tuesday, February 11, 2014, in Johannesburg, South Africa, having been postponed that Monday.[124][126] Second unit crews shot action sequences without the main cast, to be used as background plates for scenes featuring the Hulk, in the Central Business District of Johannesburg for a period of two weeks.[127][128] By mid-March, principal photography had begun at Shepperton Studios near London and was scheduled to film there for at least four months,[129][130] under the working title After Party.[131] Filming at Shepperton as well as other locations in England allowed Whedon to get a \"number of different looks and textures and moods\" to give the film a different palette and fresh aesthetic from its predecessor.[70] Production designer Charles Wood built an enormous, new Avengers Tower set, one of the largest sets ever built for a Marvel film. The set featured multiple connected environments and levels.[132] On March 22, production moved to Fort Bard, Italy and continued in the Aosta Valley region through March 28. The region doubled as the fictional Eastern European nation of Sokovia,[39] with crews replacing local storefronts with Cyrillic script.[133] Filming in South Korea began on March 30 on the Mapo Bridge,[134] and continued through April 14 at various locations in Seoul, such as Cheongdam Bridge, Digital Media City, Gangnam Boulevard and road near Kaywon University of Art and Design in Uiwang.[135] While in Seoul, the production was able to attach cameras to drones and race cars to get unique camera angles and footage.[132] An artificial island on the Han River known as the Saebit Dungdungseom served as the headquarters of an IT institute featured in the film.[136] Scenes involving Ultron's attack on parts of the city were shot in the Gangnam District.[135]\n\nIn April, shooting began in Hawley Woods in Hampshire, England,[137] and Hayley Atwell, who played Peggy Carter in previous MCU films, filmed scenes inside the Rivoli Ballroom in London while extras performed the Lindy Hop.[57] That June, scenes were shot at the University of East Anglia in Norwich and at Dover Castle in Kent, with Dover Castle used for interior shots of Strucker's Hydra base in Sokovia.[138][139][140] The next month, filming took place at a training facility for London's Metropolitan Police Service, which doubled as a city in Sokovia.[16][39] Additional filming took place in Chittagong, Bangladesh, including the Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard,[141][142] and in the state of New York.[143][144] On August 6, Whedon announced on Twitter that he had completed principal photography on Avengers: Age of Ultron.[145] Disney spent $330.6 million on Avengers: Age of Ultron from February 2013 to November 2014, but $50.7 million of this was offset by payments from the UK tax authority.[146] A report on actual production costs for films from FilmL.A. Inc., indicated a gross budget of $444 million, with a net of $365 million for Avengers: Age of Ultron.[2] This makes the film one of the most expensive films ever made.[147]\n\nCinematographer Ben Davis, who also worked with Marvel on Guardians of the Galaxy, shot the film with a main unit of three Arri Alexa cameras. Davis said, \"Although the Alexa was Marvel's preferred camera, we weren't locked into that choice from the start. What wasn't negotiable was the fact that we were shooting digital: that's how Marvel shoots all of its films.\" Davis also used Blackmagic Design's Pocket Cinema Cameras to meet the needs of the second unit kit explaining, \"The second unit typically needs a fleet of smaller cameras that are less expensive and are rugged enough to handle the various trials by fire, as it were, that we throw at them.\"[148] About the camera system, Whedon stated that this film was shot very differently from the first one; using many long lenses, and that he aimed to shoot the film almost like a documentary.[122] To create the scenes depicting how Quicksilver views the world, scenes were shot with an ultra-high-speed camera and later combined with shots of Taylor-Johnson moving through the same scene at normal speed.[39]\n\nIn June 2014, the IMAX Corporation announced that the IMAX release of the film would be converted to IMAX 3D.[150] Following the completion of principal photography several more cast members were revealed including Stellan Skarsgård,[61] Anthony Mackie,[53] Idris Elba, and Tom Hiddleston, reprising their roles from previous MCU films.[58] However, Hiddleston's scenes did not make the theatrical cut of the film, with Whedon saying what was shot \"didn't play\" and he did not want the film to feel \"overstuffed\".[86] According to Hiddleston, \"In test screenings, audiences had overemphasized Loki's role, so they thought that because I was in it, I was controlling Ultron, and it was actually imbalancing people's expectations.\"[151] Whedon later explained that Elba and Atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the Avengers from Scarlet Witch's power.[39] In December 2014, Kim's role was revealed as Dr. Helen Cho.[78][152] Additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in January 2015 at Pinewood Studios.[153] In February 2015, Marvel confirmed through promotional material that Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue in the film.[79][65] In early April 2015, Linda Cardellini and Julie Delpy were confirmed to be part of the film's cast.[59][81] At the same time, Whedon stated that the film would not contain a post-credits scene, which had become customary for MCU films. Whedon tried to come up with a post-credit scene but felt that he could not top the \"Shawarma scene\" in The Avengers, explaining, \"It didn't seem to lend itself in the same way, and we wanted to be true to what felt right. The first rule of making a sequel is take the best moments and do something else. Don't do the Indiana Jones gun trick again differently. Just go somewhere else. Don't try to hit the same highs, because people will sense it.\" However, Feige clarified, \"There will be a tag [shortly after the credits start]. But there's not a post–post–credit scene.\"[59]\n\nIn May 2015, Whedon revealed he was in conflict with Marvel executives and the film's editors about certain scenes in the film. The executives were not \"thrilled\" with the scenes at Hawkeye's farm or the dream sequences the Avengers experience because of Scarlet Witch. Also, Whedon had originally shot a much longer scene with Thor and Selvig in the cave but the final version is shorter as test audiences did not respond well to the original cut.[154] In the scene, Thor would be possessed by a Norn, a goddess of destiny, while Selvig would quiz her about Thor's hallucination.[155][156][157] Additionally, Whedon reiterated he had wanted to include Captain Marvel and Spider-Man at the end, but deals for each character (signing of an actress and a deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment, respectively) were not completed in time for their inclusion.[154]\n\nThe film contains 3,000 visual effects shots,[158] completed by ten different visual effects studios, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Trixter, Double Negative, Animal Logic, Framestore, Lola VFX, Territory, Perception, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, and The Third Floor.[159] ILM opened a facility in London, citing Avengers: Age of Ultron as a catalyst for the expansion,[160] and developed a new motion capture system for the film called Muse, which can better capture an actor's performance and combine different takes.[161] About the motion capture process, Ruffalo called it \"more of a collaboration\" since the technology is advancing, with \"the face capture and the motion capture can now [being] put together, [allowing] you [to] get a lot more latitude as a performer [...] you're no longer constricted by the attributes that you have as a person: your age, or weight, or size. None of that matters anymore. And so there's this whole exciting place to go that is kind of unknown.\"[21] Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said that the visual effects team considered depicting the Hulk when manipulated by Wanda Maximoff as being grey skinned with red eyes, but eventually decided against it, as they did not want to confuse audiences who might associate it with \"Joe Fixit\", the grey Hulk from the comics.[162]\n\nMethod Studios created the interior of the new Avengers training facility by digitally designing the training facility, extracting the characters from the original set and placing them into the new CG environment. Method also contributed to Iron Man's new Mark 45 suit and played a key role in creating Scarlet Witch's CG mind control effect.[149] Following the trend in recent years, most of the computer screens in Stark's lab, Dr. Cho's laboratory, the Quinjet and other locations in the film were not added in post-production but were actually working screens on set, adding to the realism of the film and saving some on the post-production budget. London-based Territory Studio delivered the screen visuals filled with unique imagery and animations that matched the character using them.[159] Perception worked on the main-on-end and main titles for the film. Before settling on the marble monument depiction for the main-on-end titles, Perception created three other versions, which were based on Ultron's hive mind ability from the film, \"renderings of power and pure energy\" inspired by classic comic panels, and classic moments for each character. The final design was inspired by war monuments such as the Iwo Jima memorial. For the main titles, Marvel wanted the typeface to be a direct continuation of the first film. Perception made the typeface a marble texture to mimic the main-on-end titles and changed the title's rotation (away from the camera instead of towards the camera in The Avengers), before \"Age of Ultron\" overtakes \"Avengers\" in a vibranium texture.[163]\n\nBrian Tyler signed on to compose the film's score in March 2014. He replaced Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for the first film, and Tyler's hiring marked his third collaboration with Marvel following Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World in 2013.[164] Tyler said the score would pay homage to John Williams' music for Star Wars (1977), Superman (1978), and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) while referencing the scores for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films in order to create a similar musical universe, saying, \"That's the goal for sure. You have to build in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it.\"[165] Danny Elfman also contributed music to the score,[166] reprising Silvestri's theme from the first film to create a new hybrid theme.[167] Hollywood Records released the album digitally on April 28, 2015, and in physical formats on May 19.[168]\n\nAt the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Whedon introduced a teaser trailer for the film, which included a look at an Ultron helmet and a title treatment.[169] Footage of the teaser, as well as a brief interview with Whedon, was made available as part of Iron Man 3's second screen companion app for its Blu-ray release on September 24, 2013.[170][171] On March 18, 2014, ABC aired a one-hour television special titled, Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe, which included a sneak peek of Avengers: Age of Ultron.[172] The special debuted concept art for Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, as well as art of the Hulk fighting the \"Hulkbuster\" Iron Man suit.[173][132] Harley-Davidson partnered with Marvel to provide their first electric motorcycle, Project LiveWire, for use by Black Widow in the film.[174] As with previous films, Audi provided several vehicles for Age of Ultron and commercials promoting these vehicles.[175] At the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, the cast was introduced to promote the film, along with screening footage from the film.[176] Avengers: Age of Ultron received the second most social media mentions at the convention, following Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), but had a higher intend-to-see response.[177]\n\nThe first trailer was scheduled to premiere during the airing of an episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on October 28, 2014.[181] However, on October 22, the trailer leaked online,[182] and within a few hours Marvel officially released the trailer on YouTube.[183] Entertainment Weekly and The Hollywood Reporter noted the effective use of the song \"I've Got No Strings\" from Pinocchio (1940) in the trailer.[178][179] Scott Mendelson of Forbes felt the trailer was \"such a textbook 'dark sequel' trailer that it borders on parody\" but said, \"it's a pretty spectacular piece of marketing, one that elevates itself both by the music choices and by James Spader's vocals as the title villain\".[180] The trailer received 34.3 million global views in 24 hours, 26.2 million from Marvel's YouTube channel, which broke the previous record held by Iron Man 3 with 23.14 million views. In comparison, the original Avengers teaser received 20.4 million views in 24 hours after its debut.[184] In response, Marvel agreed to air footage from Age of Ultron during the episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. that was originally scheduled to premiere the trailer.[185] At the end of October, Marvel Comic's Editor-in-Chief Axel Alonso stated there were comic tie-in plans for the film.[186]\n\nIn November 2014, ABC aired another one-hour television special titled Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!, which featured behind the scenes footage of Age of Ultron.[187] Also in November, an extended trailer debuted on Samsung Mobile's YouTube channel, featuring product placement for various Samsung devices.[188] In December 2014, additional behind the scenes footage was released as a special feature on the Guardians of the Galaxy Blu-ray, highlighting the various filming locations for the film.[144][189] That same month, ABC announced that an episode of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. would tie-in to the events of the film.[190] The episodes \"The Frenemy of My Enemy\" and \"The Dirty Half Dozen\" feature \"Easter eggs, plot threads and other connective tissue leading into the opening scene of Avengers: Age of Ultron\" while \"Scars\" explores the aftermath of the film.[191]\n\nIn January 2015, a featurette focusing on Ultron was shown at Samsung's \"Night With Marvel\" event at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).[192] Also at CES, Samsung revealed a selection of hardware inspired by the Avengers films, as well as a simulation of Avengers Tower via its Gear VR virtual reality device.[193][194] A second trailer premiered on ESPN on January 12, 2015, during the broadcast of the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship.[195] Mendelson enjoyed the trailer, but wished it did not reveal as many story elements as it did. However, he added, \"the marketing thus far [for the film] has been far superior to much of what sold The Avengers three years ago, both in terms of the specific footage and the artistic choices being made [...] I'm sold, and I imagine most of the general moviegoers are already onboard too.\"[196]\n\nOn February 3, 2015, Marvel \"stealth released\" a one-shot digital-only tie-in comic, Avengers: Age of Ultron Prelude—This Scepter'd Isle. Written by Will Corona Pilgrim and illustrated by Wellinton Alves, it reveals how Strucker came into possession of Loki's scepter and the origin of the Maximoff twins' abilities.[197] At the end of the month, the film's official poster was revealed. Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter criticized it for its lack of originality, calling it \"pretty much the poster for the first Avengers movie, except with added flying robots in the background\" and the fact that it incorporated many of the same tropes the other MCU Phase Two film posters did. These included the hero(es) staring off camera; destruction in the background as well as something occurring in the sky; and poor Photoshop on the poster, highlighting the fact that each of the actors were obviously photographed separately and were later composited together into the poster.[198] Mendelson agreed with many of McMillan's observations, and called the poster \"hilariously photoshopped\".[199]\n\nThe final trailer was \"unlocked\" by fans on March 4, 2015, via the use of hashtags on Twitter, ahead of its broadcast debut during the series premiere of American Crime on March 5.[200] Mendelson felt \"this [was] a fine final trailer, teasing what we already know, hinting at the scale and a few new action beats without telling us much we don't already know\" adding, \"Here we have the fourth and final Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer and we don't know all that much about what transpires in a moment-to-moment sense in the finished 150-minute feature. I have expressed my concern dating back to October that Marvel and Disney would release too many trailers and would by default give away too much plot and character information between October and May. But if this really is the final Avengers 2 trailer, then at least on the trailer front they have kept the film relatively unspoiled.\"[201] A week after the final trailer debuted, Marvel revealed that the trailer had \"smashed records\" with over 35 million views.[202]\n\nIn April 2015, members of the cast presented Downey with the MTV Generation Award at the 2015 MTV Movie Awards, along with debuting an exclusive clip from the film.[203] On April 27, Downey and Renner along with executives from Marvel Entertainment rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange in celebration of the film's theatrical release.[204] Disney spent a total of $26.9 million on television advertisements for the film,[205] from an estimated total marketing budget of $180 million.[206]\n\nIn January 2015, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Traveller's Tales announced a Lego video game adaptation of the first film and Age of Ultron for release in late 2015 on a variety of video game consoles.[207] In March 2015, Disney said it planned to broaden its merchandising strategy with Avengers: Age of Ultron by expanding the target demographics to women and to fans of the individual superheroes that make up the Avengers. Paul Gitter, senior vice president of Marvel licensing for Disney Consumer Products, said, \"For the first film, we primarily focused on the Avengers property and the group shots [...] Now we're broadening the line and scope to create skews that focus on the team and the individuals characters, as well.\" Disney Consumer Products partnered with Hasbro, Lego, Hot Wheels, and Funko for action figures, playsets, and other toys, and with Under Armour for apparel. Disney established new partnerships in the food and packaged-goods categories, including with Sage Fruit, ConAgra, Crunchpak, and Chobani.[208] Walt Disney India's consumer products partnered with 50 brands to promote the film in India, considered the highest ever for any film—Hollywood or Bollywood—released in India (the previous record held by Ra.One (2011) had 25 partners). Some of the brands include Amazon India, toy retailer Hamleys India, online fashion store Myntra, Hero Cycles, Mountain Dew, Liberty Shoes, Tupperware, and Subway restaurants, among others.[209] A virtual pinball table based on the film was released in April 2015 by Zen Studios.[210]\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 13, 2015,[211][212] and held its European premiere on April 21 at the Vue West End in London.[213] The film was released in 11 territories on April 22, with its release jumping to 55% of its international market (44 countries) by the end of its first weekend,[214][215] before releasing on May 1 in the United States, in 3D and IMAX 3D.[150][214][216][217] In the United States, the film opened in 4,276 theaters, including 2,761 3D theaters, 364 IMAX, 400 premium large format, and 143 D-Box theaters.[218] Many independent theater owners in Germany (approximately 700 screens) boycotted the film in response to Disney raising its rental fee from 47.7% to 53% of ticket sales. The owners felt that the \"increased fees, coupled with the cost of digitization, and rising staff and marketing costs may force some of them out of business.\"[219] Avengers: Age of Ultron is part of Phase Two of the MCU.[220]\n\nOn March 4, 2015, ticket pre-sales for the film began. Variety noted, \"The two-month gap between advance sales and the release is much wider than normal and reflects the heavy fan anticipation\" for the film.[221]\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on September 8, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, and DVD on October 2. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[222] The film was also collected in a 13-disc box set, titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection\", which includes all of the Phase Two films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and was released on December 8.[223] In July 2015, Whedon stated that he did not intend on releasing a director's cut of Avengers: Age of Ultron because despite the film's complexity, he was satisfied with the theatrical version and did not think it needed to be tweaked.[224] Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on August 14, 2018.[225]\n\nIn September 2014, TNT acquired the US cable broadcast rights, for broadcast two years after its theatrical release.[226]\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron grossed $459 million in the United States and Canada, and $943.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.403 billion,[4] becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film at the time and the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2015.[227][228] Avengers: Age of Ultron's worldwide opening of $392.5 million was the seventh-largest ever.[229] The film set a worldwide IMAX opening-weekend record with $25.2 million (previously held by The Dark Knight Rises (2012)) and also broke the record for the fastest movie to make over $40 million in IMAX theaters, doing so in 12 days.[230] According to some analysts, the opening weekend box office gross was lower than expected because of the weekend's featured boxing match between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao.[231] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $382.32 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it fourth on their list of 2015's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[232]\n\nOn May 15, 2015, Avengers: Age of Ultron became the twenty-first film in cinematic history, the third Marvel Studios film, and the eighth film distributed by Disney to cross the $1 billion threshold at the box office.[233]\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron earned $84.46 million on its opening day, marking the biggest opening day for a superhero film and the second-biggest opening and second-biggest single-day gross, behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011) ($91.7 million). The film's Friday gross included $27.6 million from Thursday night, which began at 7 p.m., and was the sixth-highest ever for Thursday preview earnings and the highest among Marvel films.[234][235] The film totaled $191.3 million in its opening weekend, the third-highest gross behind Jurassic World (2015) ($208.8 million) and The Avengers ($207.4 million).[236] It also saw the second-highest IMAX opening weekend total with $18 million (behind The Dark Knight Rises), a record $13.5 million from premium large format theaters and the highest share for the first weekend in May, accounting for 85% of the top twelve box office total earnings (previously held by Spider-Man 3 (2007)).[234][237] Of those in attendance the first weekend, 59% were male, 41% were female and 59% were over the age of 25.[234]\n\nIn its second weekend, the film fell 59%, earning $77.7 million, which was the second-biggest second weekend gross behind The Avengers' $103 million (both were surpassed a month later by Jurassic World's $106.6 million).[238] It holds the record for the second-biggest loss between first and second weekends with $113.6 million, only behind Deathly Hallows – Part 2's $121 million loss between its first and second weekends in 2011.[239] It became the third-highest-grossing film of 2015.[240]\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron earned $200.2 million in its first weekend from 44 countries, opening in first in all, which was 44% above its predecessor's opening. Additionally, the film saw the largest non-China international IMAX opening with $10.4 million. The top earning countries were South Korea ($28.2 million), the United Kingdom ($27.3 million), and Russia ($16.2 million).[215] The film broke records in many countries, including opening-day records in Mexico ($6.8 million), the Philippines ($1.6 million), and Indonesia ($900,000);[230][234][241] opening-weekend records in Mexico ($25.5 million), Russia and the CIS ($16.2 million), Hong Kong ($6.4 million), and the Philippines ($7.7 million); and highest opening weekend for a superhero film in the United Kingdom ($27.3 million), Germany ($9.3 million), Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands.[215][230][242]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, where Age of Ultron was filmed, it earned $5.4 million on its opening day and $27.3 million during the weekend, setting an opening-weekend record for a superhero film, Marvel's biggest opening in Britain, the biggest April opening, and the eighth-biggest debut.[243] It also set the best single-day earning for a Disney and superhero film with its $9.4 million haul on Saturday.[243][244] In South Korea, also where part of the film was shot, the film earned $4.9 million on its opening day and $28.2 through the weekend.[215][243] It held the record for advance-ticket sales rate, accounting for 96% of tickets reserved, breaking Transformers: Dark of the Moon's (2011) record of 94.6% in 2011, the widest release ever, across 1,826 screens, also breaking Dark of the Moon's 1,420 screens, and the fastest imported film to surpass one million admissions, doing so in two days;[245] it topped the box office for three consecutive weekends,[246] and became the biggest Disney/Marvel release as well as the second-biggest Western film in the country.[247] The Chinese opening scored the biggest weekday opening day, as well as the biggest Disney/Marvel opening, with $33.9 million,[248] and the second-biggest six-day start with $156.3 million (behind Furious 7 (2015)) of which $17.5 million came from IMAX theaters—the biggest ever.[247] Age of Ultron also opened at number one in Japan in early July 2015 with $6.5 million, the highest opening weekend for an MCU release.[249] As of March 10, 2019[update], it is the ninth-highest-grossing film,[250] and the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2015.[228] Its largest markets were China ($240.1 million), the United Kingdom ($75.5 million), and South Korea ($72.3 million).[251]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 76%, with an average score of 6.8/10, based on 376 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exuberant and eye-popping, Avengers: Age of Ultron serves as an overstuffed but mostly satisfying sequel, reuniting its predecessor's unwieldy cast with a few new additions and a worthy foe.\"[252] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 66 out of 100 based on 49 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[253] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale,[234] and those at PostTrak gave the film a 90% overall positive score and a 79% recommend.[254]\n\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"Avengers: Age of Ultron succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do, but this time the action scenes don't always measure up.\"[255] Scott Foundas of Variety wrote, \"If this is what the apotheosis of branded, big-studio entertainment has come to look like in 2015, we could be doing much worse. Unlike its title character, Age of Ultron most definitely has soul.\"[256] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times and giving the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, Richard Roeper said, \"Some day, an Avengers film might collapse under the weight of its own awesomeness. I mean, how many times can they save the world? But this is not that day.\"[257] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, \"Age of Ultron is a whole summer of fireworks packed into one movie. It doesn't just go to 11, it starts there. [Joss Whedon] takes a few wrong turns, creating a jumble when the action gets too thick. But he recovers like a pro, devising a spectacle that's epic in every sense of the word.\"[258] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three out of four stars, stating that despite being \"bigger, louder, and more disjointed\" than its predecessor, \"it's also got more personality—specifically Whedon's—than any other film in the now seven-year-old franchise.\"[259] Helen O'Hara of Empire praised the interactions between the characters, the action set-pieces and Whedon's ability as a director in her review, stating that the film \"redefines the scale we can expect from our superheroes.\"[260]\n\nConversely, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, \"Although this movie is effective moment to moment, very little of it lingers in the mind afterward. The ideal vehicle for our age of immediate sensation and instant gratification, it disappears without a trace almost as soon as it's consumed.\"[261] Scott Mendelson of Forbes said, \"Avengers: Age of Ultron plays like an obligation, a box to be checked off on a list before all parties move onto the things they really want to do.\"[262] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, \"This Avengers doesn't always pop the way that the first one sometimes did, partly because its villain isn't as memorable, despite Mr. Spader's silky threat.\"[263] Camilla Long of The Sunday Times remarked, \"Two hours of boredom and boobs add up to a sorry basis for the new Avengers.\"[264] Much like the release of Guardians of the Galaxy, the film received mixed reviews upon release in China, due to poor translations. The translations, which were said to be too literal, were thought \"to have been done by Google Translate.\"[265]\n\nAvengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.[285][286][287] Infinity War was released on April 27, 2018,[288] followed by Endgame on April 26, 2019.[287] Much of the cast returns for the two films, with additional cast and characters joining from other MCU films.[289]\n"

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Man_(film)",
        "content": "This is an accepted version of this page\n\n\nAnt-Man is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics characters of the same name: Scott Lang and Hank Pym. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 12th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Peyton Reed from a screenplay by the writing teams of Edgar Wright & Joe Cornish and Adam McKay & Paul Rudd. It stars Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man alongside Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stoll, Bobby Cannavale, Michael Peña, Tip \"T.I.\" Harris, Anthony Mackie, Wood Harris, Judy Greer, Abby Ryder Fortson, David Dastmalchian, and Michael Douglas as Hank Pym. In the film, Lang must help defend Pym's Ant-Man shrinking technology and plot a heist with worldwide ramifications.\n\nDevelopment of Ant-Man began in April 2006 with the hiring of Wright to direct and co-write with Cornish. By April 2011, Wright and Cornish had completed three drafts of the script and Wright shot test footage for the film in July 2012. Pre-production began in October 2013 after being put on hold so that Wright could complete The World's End. Casting began in December 2013, with the hiring of Rudd to play Lang. In May 2014, Wright left the project citing creative differences, though he still received screenplay and story credits with Cornish. The following month, Reed was brought in to replace Wright, while McKay was hired to contribute to the script with Rudd. Filming took place between August and December 2014 in San Francisco and Metro Atlanta.\n\nAnt-Man held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 29, 2015, and was released in the United States on July 17, as the final film in Phase Two of the MCU. It grossed more than $519 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics, who generally welcomed the film's smaller stakes than other MCU films, as well as its cast (particularly Rudd, Peña, Lilly, and Douglas), humor, and visual effects. Two sequels have been released: Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023).\n\nIn 1989, scientist Hank Pym resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. after discovering their attempt to replicate his Ant-Man shrinking technology. Believing the technology would be dangerous if replicated, Pym vows to hide it for as long as he lives. In the present day,[a] Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former protégé, Darren Cross, have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym.\n\nUpon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter Cassie unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out.\n\nPym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Hope and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While Hope harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the Wasp, disappeared into a subatomic Quantum Realm while disabling a Soviet nuclear missile in 1987. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device from the Avengers' headquarters that will aid their heist, where he briefly fights Sam Wilson.\n\nCross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an unveiling ceremony at Pym Technologies' headquarters. Lang, along with his crew and a swarm of flying ants, infiltrates the building during the event, sabotages the company's servers, and plants explosives. When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and Hope, is captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to Hydra. Lang breaks free and he and Hope dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross' particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building as Pym and Hope escape.\n\nCross dons the Yellowjacket and attacks Lang before Lang is arrested by Paxton. Cross takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into another fight. Lang overrides the regulator and shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross' suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, seemingly killing Cross. Lang disappears into the Quantum Realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the macroscopic world. Out of gratitude for Lang's heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the Quantum Realm, Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who tells him that Wilson is looking for him.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Pym shows Hope a new Wasp prototype suit and offers it to her. In a post-credits scene, Steve Rogers and Wilson have Bucky Barnes in their custody. Unable to contact Tony Stark because of \"the accords\",[b] Wilson mentions that he knows someone who can help.\n\nAdditionally, John Slattery and Hayley Atwell reprise their roles as Howard Stark and Peggy Carter, respectively, from previous MCU media.[50][51] Slattery stated that his involvement in Ant-Man was \"not that much more\" than his participation in Iron Man 2 (2010),[52] while Atwell described her appearance as being \"more of a cameo\".[51] Gregg Turkington appears as Dale, the manager of a Baskin-Robbins store;[36][53][54] and Martin Donovan plays Mitchell Carson, a former member of S.H.I.E.L.D. who works for Hydra and looks to purchase the Yellowjacket technology.[55][56] YouTuber Anna Akana portrays a writer in Luis' story at the end of the film.[57] Garrett Morris, who portrayed Ant-Man in a Saturday Night Live sketch in the 70s, appears as a taxi driver.[58] Ant-Man co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance in the film as a bartender.[59] Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan make uncredited appearances during the post-credits scene as Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes, respectively.[60] Hayley Lovitt makes a nonspeaking cameo as Janet van Dyne / Wasp.[61] Lovitt was cast for her \"saucer-like, Michelle Pfeiffer eyes\", since Pfeiffer was Reed's dream casting for Wasp; Pfeiffer would later be cast as the character for the sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018).[62] Tom Kenny provides the voice of a toy rabbit that Scott gives to Cassie.[63] Comedian Tom Scharpling portrayed someone selling a lottery ticket to Lang, in a scene that was cut from the theatrical release.[64]\n\nDevelopment of an Ant-Man film began as early as the late 1980s, when Ant-Man co-creator Stan Lee pitched the idea to New World Pictures, Marvel Comics' parent company at the time. However, Walt Disney Pictures was developing a film based on a similar concept, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989), and although Ant-Man went into development, nothing came to fruition.[65] In 2000, Howard Stern met with Marvel in an attempt to purchase the film rights to Ant-Man.[66] In May of that year, Artisan Entertainment announced a deal with Marvel to co-produce, finance, and distribute a film based on Ant-Man.[67] In 2003, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish wrote a treatment for Artisan. Wright said it had Scott Lang as a burglar \"so he could have gone slightly in the Elmore Leonard route\", though Artisan wanted the film to be \"like a family thing\". However, Wright believed that the treatment was never sent to Marvel.[68] The film rights to Ant-Man reverted back to Marvel following Lionsgate's purchase of Artisan at the end of 2003.[69][70]: 279  In 2004, the duo pitched the film to Marvel Studios' then head of production, Kevin Feige.[12] In April 2006, Marvel Studios hired Wright to direct and co-write Ant-Man with Cornish as part of its first slate of independently produced films. Wright would also co-produce with his Big Talk Productions partner Nira Park.[71]\n\n\"The thing I like about Ant-Man is that it's not like a secret power, there's no supernatural element or it's not a genetic thing. There's no gamma rays. It's just like the suit and the gas, so in that sense, it really appealed to me in terms that we could do something high-concept, really visual, cross-genre, sort of an action and special effects bonanza, but funny as well.\"\n\nAt the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con, Wright said he was intrigued by the story's high concept and character. Wright also stressed that the film would not be a spoof but an action-adventure with some comedic elements and would incorporate both the Hank Pym and Scott Lang incarnations of the character.[73] Wright said that he was looking to \"do a prologue where you see Pym as Ant-Man in action in the 60s, in sort of Tales to Astonish mode basically, and then the contemporary, sort of flash-forward, is Scott Lang's story, and how he comes to acquire the suit, how he crosses paths with Hank Pym, and then, in an interesting sort of Machiavellian way, teams up with him.\"[72] The next February, Wright said that the project was in \"a holding pattern\" while the script was being revised,[74] and that he had been doing research for the film by studying nanotechnology.[75] In March 2008, Wright said that the first draft of the script had been completed and he was working on the second.[76]\n\nStan Lee tweeted in February 2010 that Marvel was prepping the film and that he met with Wright for lunch to discuss the character.[77] Wright noted that there was no timetable for the film because Marvel did not consider the character to be one of their bigger, tentpole properties, so \"It's more like me and Kevin Feige saying...'Let's make a good script that works, that's all about a great genre film, and that isn't necessarily relying on anything else'\".[78] At the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con, Wright remarked that because his film would be an origin story and would not be released until after The Avengers (2012), the first Avengers film would not include Ant-Man, although Wright acknowledged that the character might appear in future Avengers films.[79] In January 2011, Wright stated that he had resumed writing the script for the film following the conclusion of the international promotion for Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010),[80] and by April he and Cornish delivered the second draft of Ant-Man to Marvel.[81] At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Wright said a third draft had been handed in.[82]\n\nIn May 2012, Feige said that the project was \"as close as it's ever been\" while Wright teased the film by tweeting a pictogram of Ant-Man.[83] In June, Wright spent just under a week shooting footage for a reel to test the potential look and tone and to decide how convincing Ant-Man's powers look on screen.[84] The footage was screened to audiences during the Marvel Studios panel at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, with Wright confirming that Ant-Man would be happening.[85] Germain Lussier of /Film felt the footage was \"awesome\", with \"a totally different vibe from the other Marvel films\", closer to Wight's 2007 film Hot Fuzz.[86] Lussier, along with Katy Rich of CinemaBlend, also enjoyed the costume design choice.[86][87] That October, Disney scheduled the film for release on November 6, 2015.[88]\n\nFeige stated in January 2013 that Ant-Man would be part of Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,[89] and indicated in May that the screenplay needed to be modified in order to fit into the universe, as the project had been in development before the first Iron Man (2008) film. Feige also stated that shooting was slated to begin sometime in 2014,[90] and that casting would begin towards the end of 2013.[91] In July 2013, Wright said that he and Cornish had completed the script and that Marvel allowed him to delay its production so that he could complete The World's End,[92] as that film's producer, Eric Fellner, had been diagnosed with cancer.[93]\n\nIn August 2013, after Joss Whedon, director of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), announced that Hank Pym would not be Ultron's creator, Wright said Ultron was never a part of the story of Ant-Man,[94] explaining that \"just to sort of set up what Ant-Man does is enough for one movie\".[95] Wright described Ant-Man as a standalone film but said it would fit into the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, \"I like to make it standalone because I think the premise of it needs time. I want to put the crazy premise of it into a real world, which is why I think Iron Man really works because it's a relatively simple universe; it's relatable. I definitely want to go into finding a streamlined format where you use the origin format to introduce the main character and further adventures can bring other people into it.\"[96] Wright also stated that pre-production for Ant-Man would begin in October and filming would begin in 2014.[97] The next month, Disney moved the film's release date up to July 31, 2015.[98]\n\nIn October 2013, Wright revealed that he was in Los Angeles to work on Ant-Man by tweeting a photograph from the production of the June 2012 test reel.[99] Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Paul Rudd were soon being considered for the lead role,[100] though Gordon-Levitt dismissed his consideration as a rumor.[101] Feige stated that Ant-Man would be a \"heist movie\", and that a casting announcement for Hank Pym would come before the end of 2013.[102] The next month, Feige stated that Eric O'Grady's Ant-Man would not be featured in the film,[103] while Rudd became the front-runner to play Hank Pym, and casting for the character's girlfriend had begun.[104] Around that time, the filmmakers' intentions to shoot in the United Kingdom were dashed because of a lack of studio space, which Wright believed was due to the plan by Pinewood Shepperton to add fifteen studios to their facility, which was rejected in part by the local council in May 2013 because the project was eyeing protected land.[105][106] By the end of the month, the film was scheduled to be shot in the U.S. instead.[107]\n\nIn December 2013, Wright, a fan of the Ant-Man comic book since childhood—owning copies of Tales to Astonish #27 featuring \"The Man in the Ant-Hill\" storyline and Marvel Premiere #47 featuring the first appearance of Scott Lang—[108] stated that the difference between Ant-Man and other films featuring size-changing is \"other shrinking movies are usually about somebody trapped small. This is different in that he can actually change size and he can do that at will, so it becomes more of a power than an impediment.\"[109] Wright also talked about the challenge of directing a superhero film, saying, \"Shaun and Hot Fuzz and World's End are all R-rated films. I like the challenge of making a PG-13 film. Because you've got to entertain in a different way. You don't have the same tools.\"[110] By December 19, Rudd was in negotiations to star in the film,[111][112] and Marvel announced that he had been cast as Ant-Man the next day.[113]\n\nIn January 2014, Wright posted a screenshot on his blog from the Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes (2010–2012) episode \"To Steal an Ant-Man\", which features Hank Pym and introduces the Scott Lang character, with the caption \"homework\".[114][115] Michael Douglas was subsequently cast as Pym, with Rudd confirmed to play Lang.[9] Michael Peña was offered an unspecified role in the film,[116] and filming was scheduled to take place at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[117] while Disney changed the release date once again, moving it to July 17, 2015.[118] The next month, Evangeline Lilly entered early talks to portray the female lead,[15] and Wright announced on his blog that Bill Pope, who he worked with on Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and The World's End, would be his director of photography.[119] Bryce Dallas Howard and Rashida Jones were also considered for the female lead role, while Jessica Chastain passed on it.[120] By March, Wright and Cornish turned in a fifth draft of the script, amid alleged disputes on the direction the script was taking. Wright and Cornish wrote a scene intended for the post-credits of Age of Ultron that would have acted as a prelude to the film.[121] Corey Stoll entered negotiations for an undisclosed role in the film,[24] and by April, Patrick Wilson and Matt Gerald were cast in undisclosed roles.[122][123]\n\n\"Ant-Man is interesting because he was one of the original Avengers, which I think people forget about. So, I like that idea in the movie universe... I also like that it's this sort of passing of the torch. There's sort of a weird mentor / pupil thing happening between Michael Douglas' character Hank Pym and Scott Lang, which Paul Rudd plays. Hank Pym used to be old Ant-Man and he is trying to find someone to be the new Ant-Man. I like that. I think that's sort of a classic Marvel Comics thing and something that we really haven't seen in that universe.\"\n\nOn May 23, 2014, Marvel and Wright jointly announced that Wright was leaving the project due to \"differences in their vision of the film\", and that the studio was closing in on a new director.[125] On the split, Wright said, \"I wanted to make a Marvel movie but I don't think they really wanted to make an Edgar Wright movie.\" He said Marvel had wanted to do a draft of the script without him, which he found difficult, as he had written all of his previous films: \"Suddenly becoming a director-for-hire on it, you're sort of less emotionally invested and you start to wonder why you're there, really.\"[126] The majority of Wright's crew also left the project.[126][127]\n\nBy May 30, Adam McKay had entered negotiations to replace Wright,[128] but he pulled out of negotiations the next day out of respect for Wright, who he was friends with.[129][130] On June 7, Marvel announced that Peyton Reed would direct the film, with McKay contributing to the film's script;[7] McKay felt this was the perfect result since he would not be replacing Wright, but was able to help Rudd, who he was also friends with.[131] Other directors that had been under consideration include Ruben Fleischer, Rawson Marshall Thurber, Nicholas Stoller, Michael Dowse, and David Wain.[132][133][134][135]\n\nLater in June, Feige stated the film was still intended to be released on the July 17, 2015, date, with production slated to begin on August 18, 2014.[136][137] Feige elaborated that \"much of the movie will still be based very much on [Wright and Cornish's] draft and the DNA of what Edgar has created up to this point\", with Reed stepping in to direct and McKay reworking only parts of the script. \"[Reed] wanted to be sure that he wasn't just inheriting something or following someone else's lead. Or wasn't inheriting something that the evil studio had watered down to be something bad,\" Feige continued. \"He looked at everything, he talked with us, and he said 'Number one, I agree with the direction you're going in. And number two, I can add to it.'\"[138]\n\nMcKay confirmed that Rudd helped him rewrite the script, calling Rudd \"great with dialogue\", adding \"the two of us holed up in hotel rooms on the east and west coast, and I think it was like six to eight weeks we just ground it out and did a giant rewrite of the script. I was really proud of what we did, I really thought we put some amazing stuff in there and built on an already strong script from Edgar Wright and sort of just enhanced some stuff.\"[139] Rudd elaborated, \"The idea, the trajectory, the goal, and the blueprint of it all, is really Edgar and Joe. It's their story. We changed some scenes, we added new sequences, we changed some characters, we added new characters. If you took the two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different—but the idea is all theirs.\"[140] Some additions to the film that had not been featured in Wright's version included a flashback sequence with Peggy Carter; Janet van Dyne; the Quantum Realm; and a fight with an Avenger.[62][130][141][70]: 287  According to Reed, the Quantum Realm was the MCU's version of the microverse,[40] which could not be called that for legal reasons. The alternate name was suggested by consultant Spiros Michalakis, a quantum physicist and staff researcher at the California Institute of Technology, to \"inject elements of modern physics into the script\".[142] Reed also offered contributions to the revised script, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result.[19] One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp being \"a crucial part\" of the Ant-Man comics.[143] For their efforts, McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story.[144] Wright also held an executive producer credit on the film.[145]\n\nBy the end of July, Wilson left the film because of scheduling conflicts brought on by the filming delay, and characters being played by Gerald and Kevin Weisman were cut in McKay's revised script.[30] Also, Reed indicated that in addition to Georgia, filming would take place in San Francisco.[146] The next month, Reed revealed that Scott Lang's daughter would appear in the film,[147] and Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer were hired to make further revisions to the script.[148] Ferrari and Barrer were hired after Reed read their spec script Die in a Gunfight which Reed felt was \"really interesting\".[141] Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the Marvel One-Shot films, did uncredited work on the film as well,[149] scripting the strip club scene and Stan Lee's cameo.[150] After reading the revised script, Evangeline Lilly felt that the film was \"pulled\" more into the MCU than Wright's version which \"was much more in the Edgar Wright camp of films.\" She added that, while Wright's version was \"incredible\" and would have been great to film and watch, \"it wouldn't have fit in the Marvel Universe. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb, no matter how good it was. It just would have taken you away from this cohesive universe they're trying to create. And therefore it ruins the suspended disbelief that they've built.\"[17] The character Arnim Zola, who was played by Toby Jones in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) was considered to make an appearance in the film, with concept art created depicting him in his robot body from the comics.[151] Reed said the costume design was influenced by Asian tokusatsu superheroes such as Ultraman and Inframan.[152]\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 18, 2014, in San Francisco,[36] under the working title Bigfoot.[6] Scenes were shot in the Tenderloin neighborhood and Buena Vista Park.[153] By the end of September 2014, production on Ant-Man moved to Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[154] and David Callaham completed a rewrite of the film.[155] Filming also took place at the State Archives building in Downtown Atlanta,[156] to double as Pym Technologies, which is located on Treasure Island, San Francisco in the film.[157] In October 2014, Martin Donovan was added to the cast,[55] and Feige revealed that Ant-Man would no longer start Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and would instead be the final film of Phase Two.[158] When told by /Film's Germain Lussier that this placement between Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War made the film feel like an afterthought, Feige replied,\n\nIt's not [an after thought]. The truth is the phases mean a lot to me and some people but...Civil War is the start of Phase Three. It just is. And Ant-Man is a different kind of culmination of Phase Two because it very much is in the MCU. You meet new characters and you learn about Hank Pym and his lineage with the MCU over the years. But at the same time, it also picks up the thread of Age of Ultron in terms of heroes—major heroes, Avengers—coming from unexpected places... And in that way it connects a lot. Also, Hank Pym's attitude towards Avengers, towards S.H.I.E.L.D., and kind of the cinematic universe in general, is much more informed after the events of Age of Ultron, and in a certain way, before the events of Civil War.[159]\nFeige later expanded on this by saying, \"[W]e put Ant-Man at the end of Phase Two as opposed to the beginning of Phase Three, because it sets up a lot of the things you're going to see heading into Phase Three, one of which is this mind-bending, reality-altering landscape [in Doctor Strange].\"[42] On December 5, 2014, Reed announced on social media that principal photography on Ant-Man had been completed.[160]\n\nFor the film, cinematographer Russell Carpenter used a 1.85 aspect ratio shot with Arri Alexa XT and M cameras, using the M for fight sequences and helicopter filming. Camera operator Peter Rosenfeld said, \"Russell and Peyton's decision to shoot in 1.85 was a good call, since at 2.39 there's insufficient height in frame to appreciate the vertical aspects of [Ant-Man] going from standing full-size to falling through a crack in the floor.\" Carpenter and Technicolor also devised a lookup table (LUT) to darken the color palette. Carpenter said, \"For a lot of recent comedies I've kept my LUTs kind of 'Kodak' – saturated and upbeat. But this show needed something different that affected skin tones and the Ant-Man suit, which dates back to the 1980s, so it looks a little run-down. What I loved about this LUT was how it allowed the costume to retain the color but took it from fire-engine red to something a little more weathered.\"[161]\n\nThe filmmakers made extensive use of macro photography. Production designer Shepherd Frankel said, \"It's more visually interesting to depict things from Ant-Man's point of view instead of seeing him from a normal perspective. But we wanted a realistic realization, not Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with its oversized set pieces.\"[161] Rebecca Baehler served as the director of macro photography, taking cues from Carpenter.[162] Carpenter said vibration became \"a tremendous problem\" when moving the camera during the macro photography because \"one inch off the ground is like fifteen feet in the air. From an ant's perspective, you move four inches, to a human perspective, that's a football field!\" The filmmakers needed a creative solution, so they turned to Baehler, who had a background in commercial \"tabletop\" photography. In order to add Rudd's performance as Ant-Man when in the macro world, a Centroid facial motion-capture set-up was used, with a five-camera array of Alexas surrounding Rudd. Rosenfeld explained, \"One camera was set up vertically while the others were horizontal with overlapping image areas, all set to record at 48 frames per second. This maximized resolution and provided 3D modeling [of] Paul's performance.\" Reed would then call out story moments with Rudd performing \"facial expressions that would later be composited on a CG Ant-Man\".[161] Entomologist Steven Kutcher provided suggestions to the filmmakers on how to film live ants.[163]\n\nFollowing the completion of principal photography, Marvel released an updated synopsis revealing that Jordi Mollà was included in the cast and the names of several supporting characters.[35] However, Mollà subsequently did not appear in the theatrical release of the film. Reed explained that the film's original opening, which was filmed and cut in the editing process, featured a standalone sequence similar to the opening of a James Bond film, where an unseen Pym was attempting to retrieve some microfilm from Mollà's character, Castillo, a Panama army general. Reed stated the scene was going to show Ant-Man's powers, without seeing him, almost \"like an Invisible Man sequence, and it's really, really cool. It started to feel tonally disconnected from the movie we were making and story-wise, and it also kind of like, it set a standalone adventure, but it didn't just connect to the rest of our story...It felt like vestige of those earlier drafts [by Wright and Cornish], which as a standalone thing was really cool.\"[164] Dan Lebental and Colby Parker, Jr. served as film editors.[36] In March 2015, Hayley Atwell confirmed that she would reprise her role as Peggy Carter in the film.[51] In April 2015, Reed stated that the film was not completed yet and would be undergoing \"a little bit of additional\" filming.[165]\n\nIn June 2015, Feige confirmed that the character of Janet van Dyne would be seen, though the film would not address Pym and Van Dyne's infamous domestic abuse storyline in the comics, saying, \"We hint at a temper in a way that people who know the stories might go, 'Oh, perhaps that's a bit of [Hank's] character,' but not in a way that would ever indicate [he beat his wife].\"[166] Also in the month, Reed confirmed there would be a post-credit sequence \"that may tie into the other films.\"[167] Feige revealed the post-credit sequence was footage shot by Anthony and Joe Russo for Captain America: Civil War (2016), saying the clip would be seen in that film, though it may be \"different takes...different angles.\"[168][169] On June 25, 2015, Reed announced on social media that production of Ant-Man was officially complete.[170] In early July 2015, an international teaser trailer revealed that Anthony Mackie would appear in the film as Sam Wilson / Falcon.[39] Mackie appears in the post-credit sequence as well, along with Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan as Steve Rogers / Captain America and Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, respectively.[60] Stan stated the scene that was used for the post-credit sequence was shot in May 2015, and would appear in the middle of Civil War.[171] Reed also said that the end of the film originally had a sequence where Ant-Man went after Carson to retrieve the stolen vial of Cross' particles, \"... But then for a couple reasons, it felt like maybe we should leave those particles out there.\"[172] For the title sequences, Marvel again went with design firm Sarofsky, who had done the credits for both The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), with the credits \"intricately connected to the film's overall narrative.\"[173]\n\nVisual effects for the film were provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Double Negative, Luma Pictures, and Method Studios, with previsualization by The Third Floor.[19][162][174] Double Negative handled the scenes featuring shrunken characters, incorporating the macro photography and motion capture performances shot in principal photography with digital models of the characters. Double Negative also worked on Ant-Man's shrinking effect, in coordination with ILM to be used by all vendors, which showed the outline of his body – an element from the comics. Visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, \"It's like a little time echo. As Ant-Man shrinks in almost a stop motion way he would leave behind outlines of the poses he'd been in as he shrinks down... We'd have two CG cameras rendering the action from different points along the timeline with slightly different framings. One would be the main shot camera, the other would be a utility camera that would provide renders of static poses of Ant-Man at different points along the timeline.\"[162]\n\nFor the flashbacks in 1989, Douglas and Donovan appeared de-aged via CGI, alongside Atwell as Carter (aged in makeup and with CGI) and John Slattery as Howard Stark.[6][53][162][166] To de-age Douglas, Lola VFX used a similar process and technology that was used to make Steve Rogers skinny in The First Avenger and Carter older in The Winter Soldier as well as footage of Douglas' other films from the late 1980s as reference.[42][174] Dax Griffin served as Douglas' body double and an additional reference for Lola, because of his \"striking resemblance of Michael when he was about 40\".[174][175] For Donovan, he only needed to be de-aged about a decade, so no double was used. The work on him focused on his eyes, neck, and chin. Atwell wore a wig on set, along with a fine layer of latex makeup to give the skin a more leathery look, with Lola transposing the facial features of an elderly actress onto her face.[162]\n\nMethod and Luma both worked on creating the various ants seen in the film, with Method creating the several species of ants, to share among the vendors. Luma also handled many of the scenes at Pym Technologies when Ant-Man attempts to acquire the Yellowjacket. ILM worked on the Falcon fight sequence, having done Falcon visual effects in The Winter Soldier. Using practical suit pieces built by Legacy Effects, ILM mixed live-action shots with digital take-overs and fully digital shots to create the sequence. ILM also handled the sequences in the Quantum Realm, providing an array of microscopic and largely psychedelic imagery for the subatomic shrinking, taking advantage of procedural fractal rendering techniques the studio had utilized on Lucy.[162]\n\nIn February 2014, Wright announced that Steven Price would score the film.[119] However, Price left soon after Wright's departure from the project in May 2014.[127] In January 2015, Christophe Beck, who worked with Reed on Bring It On, was hired to replace Price.[176] Describing the film's score, Beck said, \"For Ant-Man, I wanted to write a score in the grand symphonic tradition of my favorite superhero movies, with a sweeping scope and a big, catchy main theme. What makes this score stand out among other Marvel movies, though, is a sneaky sense of fun since it is, after all, not only a superhero movie, but also a heist comedy.\"[177] Hollywood Records released the soundtrack digitally on July 17, 2015, and had a physical release on August 7.[178]\n\nIn March 2014, ABC aired a one-hour television special, Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe, which included a sneak peek of Ant-Man.[179][180] In July 2014, Reed, Rudd, Douglas, Lilly, and Stoll appeared at Marvel Studios' panel at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con to help promote the film and screen a visual effects test featuring Rudd and Douglas.[23] In October 2014, Marvel Comics' Editor-in-Chief Axel Alonso stated there are comic tie-in plans for the film.[181] In November 2014, ABC aired another one-hour television special titled, Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!, which featured behind the scenes footage of Ant-Man.[182] Marvel Comics' February 2015 solicitations released in December 2014, revealed a two-issue comic tie-in, Marvel's Ant-Man Prelude, following Hank Pym as Ant-Man on a mission during the Cold War.[183] A second comic tie-in, Marvel's Ant-Man—Scott Lang: Small Time, was released digitally on March 3, 2015. It explains Lang's circumstances at the beginning of the film.[184] A virtual pinball based on the film was released on July 14, 2015, by Zen Studios.[185]\n\nIn January 2015, Disney officially began the film's marketing campaign by releasing a miniature \"ant-sized\" teaser trailer, a full-sized version of the same teaser trailer, a poster, a cover on Entertainment Weekly, and a full-length trailer during the premiere of the television series Agent Carter. Scott Mendelson of Forbes, said, \"It was darn-clever for Disney to put out a miniature 'can't see anything without a microscope' version of the now-standard trailer for the trailer. I sighed just a little when they 'gave in' and released a human-sized version, realizing that Disney had just released what amounted to a teaser to a teaser to a trailer... But nonetheless, credit where credit is due, Disney was able to turn a single theatrical trailer into three separate news drops in about five days.\" Mendelson went on to say that \"the peppy, witty trailer above is a general audience sell. Marvel knows the geeks will come if only to throw stones, but it's the mainstream audience that needs to be sold. So far, so good.\"[186] However, Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the trailer for its placement during the broadcast premiere of Agent Carter, its tone, its soundtrack, and for being thematically similar to other trailers from Marvel Studios. McMillan concluded, \"The Ant-Man trailer isn't bad, per se; it is, however, impressively underwhelming, which almost seems worse. Thanks to the last-minute exit of original writer-director Edgar Wright and the subsequent struggle to find a replacement, Ant-Man has become the movie that people are expecting to be Marvel's first failure, in critical if not financial terms, at least; this trailer, which fails to convince and gets by on goodwill for those involved and the Marvel brand as much as anything else, doesn't do enough — or anything, really — to persuade audiences that that's not the case.\"[187] The trailer generated 29 million views worldwide in three days, the third-largest viewership for a Marvel Studios film, behind trailers for Iron Man 3 and Avengers: Age of Ultron.[188]\n\nIn April 2015, Marvel debuted a second trailer for Ant-Man. Mendelson said it was \"frankly the Ant-Man trailer that we've been waiting for. It's not just funny and exciting, it's an 'Ah ha!' moment when we realize just what exactly an Ant-Man movie has to offer.\"[189] Also in April, miniature billboards promoting Ant-Man with battery-powered LED lights began appearing in Melbourne, Brisbane and other areas around Queensland, Australia as part of a street marketing campaign for the film.[190] The next month, Marvel, in partnership with Dolby Laboratories, Visa, and Raspberry Pi, announced the \"Ant-Man Micro-Tech Challenge\", aimed at females aged 14 through 18, to create DIY projects involving micro technology and readily accessible and found materials. Winners teamed with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) programs in their areas to lead teams in recreating their projects.[191] In June, Marvel released posters featuring Ant-Man juxtaposed with Iron Man's armor, Captain America's shield, and Thor's hammer Mjolnir. Mendelson compared this to Disney's marketing campaign for Lilo & Stitch that put the protagonist into iconic scenes from other Disney cartoons.[192] A six-minute IMAX preview of the film began screening before showings of Jurassic World,[193] and scenes from the film were shown at Disney California Adventure's Bug's Life Theater in 3D with in-theater effects.[194]\n\nIn early July 2015, Marvel began a viral marketing campaign featuring Leslie Bibb, reprising her role from the Iron Man films as journalist Christine Everhart, reporting for the faux news program WHIH Newsfront. In the program, Everhart discuses the fallout from the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Lang's imprisonment,[195][196] and events leading to Captain America: Civil War.[11] Also in July, Michael Douglas and executives from Marvel Entertainment rang the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange in celebration of the release of Ant-Man.[197] Disney spent $34.8 million on television advertising for the film, more than the $26.9 million spent for Avengers: Age of Ultron, since the former was a new property.[198] In December 2015, to commemorate the home media release of Ant-Man, the 360 Company launched a website that offers visitors a view of various London landmarks from the perspective of an ant in a Google Street View–type experience. The company commissioned photographer Will Pearson to capture ten different locations including Tower Bridge, Oxford Circus, the British Museum, St Paul's Cathedral and Nelson's Column using a 360° miniature camera that sat centimeters off of the ground.[199]\n\nAnt-Man premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 29, 2015,[200] and opened the 2015 Fantasia International Film Festival on July 14, 2015, along with Miss Hokusai.[201] The film was released in France on July 14,[202] and was released in North America on July 17,[118] in 3D and IMAX 3D.[203][204] The film was released in the United States in 3,800 theaters, with the breakdown of 3,100 3D screens, 361 IMAX screens, 388 large format screens and 133 D-Box screens.[202] Ant-Man had originally been scheduled for release on November 6, 2015.[88] In September 2013, the release was moved to July 31, 2015,[98] before changing for a final time to July 17, 2015, in January 2014.[118] An unfinished version of the film was screened on June 24, 2015, at CineEurope.[205] Ant-Man was the last film released in Phase Two of the MCU.[158]\n\nAnt-Man was released for digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on November 17, 2015, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, and DVD on December 8. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[206] Upon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film debuted at number two on the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart, with 63% of unit sales coming from Blu-ray.[207]\n\nThe film was also collected in the 13-disc box set, titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection\", which includes all of the Phase Two films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was released on December 8, 2015.[208]\n\nIn April 2023, Disney+ added the ability to view the film with American Sign Language (ASL) featuring ASL performer Jac Cook. The service was created by Deluxe Media and Grupo Steno, with Delbert Whetter from RespectAbility serving as an ASL consultant along with Douglas Ridloff, who previously was the ASL consultant on the film Eternals (2021) and the Disney+ series Hawkeye (2021).[209]\n\nAnt-Man grossed $180.2 million in North America and $339.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $519.3 million.[2] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $103.9 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it 14th on their list of 2015's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[210]\n\nAnt-Man made $6.4 million from its Thursday night showings in North America, with 48% of tickets sales for IMAX and other large-format showings, and $23.4 million on its opening day, including Thursday's previews,[211] making it the second-lowest opening day for a Marvel film, only ahead of 2008's The Incredible Hulk ($21.4 million).[212] It fell 18% to earn $19.25 million on Saturday, and for its opening weekend total, earned $57.2 million.[211][213] It marked the second-lowest debut for Marvel ahead of the $55.4 million debut of The Incredible Hulk in 2008.[214] IMAX contributed $6.1 million to the opening gross, with premium large format screens comprising $6.4 million and Cinemark XD comprising $1.3 million, respectively. Ant-Man continued Marvel's streak of number one opening films, giving the studio its twelfth consecutive win.[211] Disney reported that the film drew the largest share of families (28%) and women (32%) of any Marvel superhero title.[214] It was also the biggest live-action opening ever for Rudd (breaking Knocked Up's record of $30.7 million) and a record opening for Douglas.[211] It continued to be the top film at the box office in its second weekend.[215]\n\nOutside North America, it earned $55.4 million in its opening weekend from 37 countries, debuting in third place at the international box office behind the Chinese film Monster Hunt and Minions as well as an IMAX opening of $9.1 million. The top openings were the UK ($6 million), Mexico ($5.6 million), and Russia ($4.9 million). It had the biggest opening for a first-installment Marvel film in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.[216] The film's opening in South Korea in early September 2015 earned $9.3 million, the highest opening for an international market at the time,[217] before being surpassed by the Chinese opening in mid-October 2015, which earned $42.4 million, with $5.1 million coming from IMAX. The large opening weekend in China helped Ant-Man place first at the international box office for the first time, with the Chinese opening the second largest for an MCU film in the country behind Avengers: Age of Ultron.[218][219] The film stayed at number one in China for a second week, earning an additional $22 million.[220] As of November 1, 2015[update], the largest markets are China with $101.3 million, followed by the UK with $25.4 million, and South Korea with $18.9 million.[221][222]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 83%, with an average score of 6.9/10, based on 341 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Led by a charming performance from Paul Rudd, Ant-Man offers Marvel thrills on an appropriately smaller scale – albeit not as smoothly as its most successful predecessors.\"[223] On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 64 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[224] CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film an \"A\" grade on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it 4 out of 5 stars.[211]\n\nJustin Chang of Variety said the film \"succeeds well enough as a genial diversion and sometimes a delightful one, predicated on the rarely heeded Hollywood wisdom that less really can be more.\"[225] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter remarked, \"Although the story dynamics are fundamentally silly and the family stuff, with its parallel father-daughter melodrama, is elemental button-pushing, a good cast led by a winning Paul Rudd puts the nonsense over in reasonably disarming fashion.\"[226] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Playful in unexpected ways and graced with a genuinely off-center sense of humor, Ant-Man (engagingly directed by Peyton Reed) is light on its feet the way the standard-issue Marvel behemoths never are.\"[227] Kim Newman of Empire wrote that it \"straddles as many genres as the Avengers films have characters but manages to do most of them pretty well. Extremely likable, with a few moments of proper wonder.\"[228] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, \"This film is a passable piece of drone work from the ever-expanding Marvel-Disney colony.\"[229]\n\nFor some critics, Ant-Man is seen as one of the more exceptional films in the Marvel franchise. Richard Brody of The New Yorker cited the film as \"the non-bombastic superhero movie\" that strays from the grandiose tone of other films in its genre, stating that the film is \"a bracing, giddy delight.... [a neoclassical comedy] more closely related to Alfred Hitchcock's [To Catch a Thief] and to hectically skimpy B-movies than to the other members of the Marvel family.\"[230] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com praised how the film \"[f]eels handmade, not Marvel factory-approved. [It reminded me] of Zemeckis when Zemeckis was fun.\"[231] In May 2016, ten months after Ant-Man was released, Seitz admitted that his \"affection for it has increased with time\" and compared its sweet and melodramatic sensibility to Spider-Man 2.[232]\n\nConversely, Alonso Duralde of TheWrap said the film \"serves up jokes that don't land and thrills that don't thrill.\"[233] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said Ant-Man \"is a lightweight, cliché-riddled origins story that veers between inside-joke comedy, ponderous redemption story lines and admittedly nifty CGI sequences that still seem relatively insignificant compared to the high stakes and city-shattering destruction that take place in most of the Avengers movies.\"[234] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian wrote, \"Ant-Man is a cut-and-shut muddle, haunted by [Edgar Wright's] ghost, produced by a high-end hot dog factory, by turns giddying and stupefying.\"[235] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said that it is \"a film that will surely be popular, given Marvel's marketing might, but one that's woefully short on coherence and originality.\"[236] Christopher Orr of The Atlantic said, \"It's difficult to shake the sense that the film was assembled hurriedly and somewhat haphazardly. Which, from all available evidence, is exactly what happened.\"[237]\n\nA sequel, Ant-Man and the Wasp, was released on July 6, 2018, with Reed returning as director. Production writers Barrer and Ferrari wrote the screenplay with Rudd, Chris McKenna, and Erik Sommers. Rudd, Lilly, Cannavale, Peña, Harris, Greer, Dastmalchian, Fortson and Douglas all reprise their roles from Ant-Man,[258] and are joined by Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, Laurence Fishburne as Bill Foster, Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, Randall Park as Jimmy Woo, and Walton Goggins as Sonny Burch.[258][259]\n\nA third Ant-Man film, titled Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, was released on February 17, 2023,[260] with Reed returning to direct and Jeff Loveness writing the script.[261][262] Rudd, Lilly, Douglas, and Pfeiffer reprise their roles, while Kathryn Newton takes over as Cassie Lang. Jonathan Majors joins as Kang the Conqueror.[261]\n"

        "content": "\n\nCaptain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and the 13th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo from a screenplay by the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America alongside an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Marisa Tomei, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, Martin Freeman, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures the team into two opposing factions—one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark (Downey).\n\nDevelopment of Civil War began in late 2013 when Markus and McFeely began writing the screenplay, which borrows concepts from the 2006 comic book storyline \"Civil War\" while also focusing on story and character elements from the previous Captain America films to conclude the trilogy. Following positive reactions to The Winter Soldier, the Russo brothers were brought back to direct in early 2014. The film's title and premise were revealed in October 2014, along with Downey's involvement as Stark; additional cast members joined in the following months. Principal photography began in April 2015 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia. It continued in the Metro Atlanta area before concluding in Germany in August 2015, with the film being the first to use IMAX's digital 2D cameras (for the film's central airport fight sequence). Visual effects were provided by nearly 20 different studios.\n\nCaptain America: Civil War held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 12, 2016, and was released in the United States on May 6, as the first film in Phase Three of the MCU. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $1.1 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2016, and received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances (particularly Evans and Downey), action sequences, and themes. A fourth film, Captain America: Brave New World (2025), is a continuation of Marvel Studios' Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021), following Mackie's Sam Wilson as Captain America.\n\nIn 1991, the brainwashed super-soldier James \"Bucky\" Barnes is dispatched from a Hydra base in Siberia to intercept an automobile carrying a case of super-soldier serum. In the present day, approximately one year after Ultron is defeated by the Avengers in the nation of Sokovia,[a] Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson, and Wanda Maximoff stop Brock Rumlow from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in Lagos. Rumlow blows himself up, attempting to kill Rogers. Maximoff telekinetically diverts the explosion, accidentally destroying a nearby building and killing several Wakandan humanitarian workers in the process.\n\nThaddeus Ross, the U.S. Secretary of State,  informs the Avengers that the United Nations (UN) is preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords, which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. The Avengers are divided: Tony Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of politicians. Meanwhile, Helmut Zemo tracks down and kills Barnes' old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes' brainwashing. At a UN conference in Vienna where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King T'Chaka of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is Barnes, whom T'Chaka's son, T'Challa, vows to kill. Informed by Sharon Carter of Barnes' whereabouts and the authorities' intentions to kill him, Rogers decides to try to bring in Barnes—his childhood friend and war comrade—himself. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to Bucharest and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but all four, including T'Challa, are apprehended by the Bucharest police and James Rhodes.\n\nImpersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo recites the words to activate Barnes's brainwashing. He questions Barnes, then sends him on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed \"Winter Soldiers\" are kept in cryogenic stasis. Unwilling to wait for authorization to apprehend Zemo, Rogers and Wilson go rogue, and recruit Maximoff, Clint Barton, and Scott Lang to their cause. With Ross's permission, Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, T'Challa, Rhodes, Vision, and Peter Parker to capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' group at Leipzig/Halle Airport, where they fight until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape.  As Rogers and Barnes are escaping, Rhodes is inadvertently shot down by Vision, and becomes partially paralyzed. The rest of Rogers' team is captured and detained at the Raft prison, and Romanoff goes into exile.\n\nStark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, leading to an intense fight, in which Stark destroys Barnes' robotic arm, and Rogers disables Stark's armor. Rogers departs with Barnes, leaving his shield behind. Satisfied that he has avenged his family's deaths in Sokovia from the Avengers' actions by successfully fracturing them, Zemo attempts suicide, but he is stopped by T'Challa and taken to the authorities.\n\nIn the aftermath, Stark provides Rhodes with exoskeletal leg braces that allow him to walk again, while Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft. In a mid-credits scene, Barnes, granted asylum in Wakanda, chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found. In a post-credits scene, Parker explores the features of the web shooters built for him by Stark.\n\nAdditionally, John Slattery and Kerry Condon reprise their roles as Howard Stark and the voice of F.R.I.D.A.Y. from previous MCU films.[90][91] John Kani appears as T'Chaka, father of T'Challa and ruler of Wakanda;[90] Hope Davis appears as Maria Stark, Tony Stark's mother;[92] Gene Farber appears as Vasily Karpov, the Hydra official who oversaw the Winter Soldier program;[93] and Florence Kasumba portrays Ayo, a member of T'Challa's Dora Milaje.[94] Alfre Woodard, who portrays Mariah Dillard in the MCU TV series Luke Cage, briefly appears in the film as Miriam Sharpe, the mother of an American citizen killed in the battle of Sokovia. Woodard was suggested for the role by Downey before Marvel Studios learned of her casting in Luke Cage.[95] Jim Rash appears as a faculty member at MIT,[96][97] while Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance as a FedEx deliveryman,[97][98] and co-director Joe Russo cameos as Theo Broussard, a psychiatrist murdered by Zemo.[93][99] Damion Poitier, who appeared as Thanos in The Avengers before Josh Brolin was cast in that role for subsequent films, appears as one of Rumlow's mercenaries.[93]\n\nThis is the Civil War of the Cinematic Universe, which will be greatly inspired by the \"Civil War\" of the comic universe, but we have a very different continuity going on ... It's not about the secret identity thing, as much as it is about, overall, who reports to who, and who can agree to [an] oversight committee. Because as of now, in [Age of Ultron], there is no more security council, there is no S.H.I.E.L.D., obviously. Stark is paying for [the Avengers], Captain America is running it, and things occur that will make governments begin to question.\n\nIn March 2014, Anthony and Joe Russo confirmed that they had signed on to return as directors for a third Captain America film, along with Chris Evans as Captain America, Kevin Feige as producer, and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely as screenwriters.[10][101] Markus and McFeely had been working on the screenplay since late 2013,[102] while the Russo brothers began work in February 2014.[103][104] The re-hiring of the directors, three months before the release of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, came as a result of Marvel executives being impressed with test screenings of that film.[10] Evans earned $15 million for the film.[105]\n\nIn an April 2014 interview, Joe Russo described the project as a continuation of the story from Captain America: The Winter Soldier: \"What's nice about the film is that ... it's a two-parter. There's a journey that the Winter Soldier goes on that isn't complete yet.\"[106] That month, Marvel announced a release date of May 6, 2016,[107] and Trent Opaloch, who was the cinematographer on The Winter Soldier, said he would return for the sequel.[108] In July, Markus and McFeely stated that they were midway through a first draft for the film, on which principal photography was expected to begin in April 2015.[109] The following month, they stated that they were looking to make the tone of the film \"an amalgam\" of The First Avenger and The Winter Soldier,[110] with the Russos likening it to a psychological thriller, citing Seven, Fargo, and The Godfather as influences,[8] along with westerns and Brian De Palma's films.[89] The Russos also stated that \"a good portion of [Civil War is] actually funnier than Winter Soldier\" with a more comedic tone and lighter moments throughout.[111]\n\nIn August 2014, the Russos stated that the film would be set \"a couple years\" after The Winter Soldier, and would continue to focus on Steve Rogers' relationship with Bucky Barnes as well as the political themes related to Captain America. Anthony stated, \"The character was invented for an explicitly political purpose. So it's hard to get away from that nature.\" The Russos also said that they would be \"bringing some new elements to the table that will give us a twist on Winter Soldier\",[112] and indicated that filming was scheduled to begin in Atlanta. They described themselves as \"ecstatic\" with a first draft of the screenplay submitted by Markus and McFeely, and also stated that the film's title would be announced \"in a month or so at most\", and that the concept and title for the film came from Feige, who had it \"for a while\".[103][113] In September, Joe expanded by saying the film would have another \"big idea that alters the universe as a whole in some way\" similar to S.H.I.E.L.D. falling in The Winter Soldier. The rest of the film, such as the characters, story, and tone, would be left open to the Russos' and writers' interpretations.[113]\n\nBy October 2014, Robert Downey Jr. had entered final negotiations to reprise his role as Tony Stark / Iron Man in the film. Downey was added in order for the film to adapt the 2006–07 \"Civil War\" comic book storyline written by Mark Millar, which pitted Iron Man against Captain America.[18] At the end of the month, it was confirmed that Sebastian Stan would return as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier.[23] A few days later, Marvel revealed that the film would be titled Captain America: Civil War, confirming Downey's appearance and announcing that Chadwick Boseman would appear in the film as Black Panther ahead of his own solo film.[15][37][38] Feige also confirmed that the film would be the first in the MCU's Phase Three slate of films.[100] Anthony Russo stated that adapting the \"Civil War\" storyline was not always the intended storyline and direction for the film when the brothers initially signed on to return as directors.[114] Markus expanded on this, saying the original concept for a third Captain America film \"never got to draft\", with Feige at some point telling the writing team to begin adapting \"Civil War\" around their original ideas. McFeely also added that, despite the shift in direction for the film, \"The central theme, even the way Zemo is operating, are from that [early] iteration.\"[115] The Russos revealed that, had negotiations with Downey to appear in the film failed, they would have used the Madbomb storyline from the Captain America comics, which was eventually used as a plot point in the first season of the Agent Carter TV series. The premise for the film would have centered on Zemo detonating the Madbomb, which would \"turn hordes of people into berserkers\" to present a physical threat to Captain America, while still pitting heroes against each other, as some would be zombified due to the Madbomb, to satisfy an \"emotional component\" for the film.[116]\n\nMcFeely said that the idea of basing a film on \"Civil War\" had \"been on and off the table for a while\" at Marvel Studios, explaining, \"it's a challenge to do it and make sure that all the characters that we've established, and everyone's established in the MCU are serviced and sound correct. Because there's a difference between the characters in \"Civil War\", which was written in 2006, 2007. The MCU doesn't exist [when it was written]. There isn't a Robert Downey, Jr. or Chris Evans who has helped create the character[s] so we need to make sure that that template gets adjusted\".[117] Joe Russo added that the \"essence\" of \"Civil War\" was used, such as \"the concept of registration, the notion that heroes need to be either monitored or controlled because their power can be scary\" being applicable. Anthony Russo expanded, \"in a lot of ways [superhero registration] can be a political issue, and we didn't want the conflict of the movie to solely exist on that level. We wanted to figure out very personal reasons why everyone's relationship to this idea of registration is going to become complicated. That's what the relationship between Steve and Bucky allowed us to do, to get very personal in terms of why people would lean one way or the other.\"[11] Executive producer Nate Moore added that \"it felt like it was kind of the right time\" to adapt \"Civil War\" given The Avengers, plus many of the Phase Two films (Thor: The Dark World, The Winter Soldier, and Avengers: Age of Ultron), all dealt with \"world-ending experiences. We felt like we had to tell the next step in that story, which is ... what is the world's reaction?\"[8]\n\nExecutives at Marvel Entertainment balked at the idea of Captain America and Iron Man coming to blows at the end of the film and wanted the Avengers to unite to fight Zemo and the supersoldiers at the Hydra base in Siberia instead. The Russos were not happy with this idea, with Joe Russo saying, \"There's nothing interesting about that film. We're not here to make that movie. We're not interested in telling another superhero story.\" Feige supported the Russos, who were going to leave the film if the changes were forced on them.[118] This prompted Walt Disney Studios head Alan F. Horn to back the Russos in making the film as originally intended, and led to oversight of Marvel Studios being moved from Marvel Entertainment to Walt Disney Studios in 2015.[119]\n\nIn November 2014, Daniel Brühl joined the cast in an unspecified role,[28] while Anthony Mackie and Frank Grillo were confirmed to return as Sam Wilson / Falcon and Brock Rumlow / Crossbones, respectively.[28][76] Following the November 2014 hacking of Sony Pictures' computers, emails between Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal and president Doug Belgrad were released stating that Marvel wanted to include Spider-Man (whose film rights are licensed to Sony) in the film, but talks between the studios concerning this were believed to have broken down.[120] However, in February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios reached a licensing deal for the use of Spider-Man in an MCU film,[121] and reports indicated that the character would indeed appear in Civil War.[122][123] The Russos stated they were lobbying for months to include the character in the film.[111] In January 2015, Mackie revealed that, in addition to Atlanta, filming locations would include Puerto Rico and Berlin,[124] while the Russo brothers confirmed that Scarlett Johansson would return in the film as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow.[19] Editor Jeffrey Ford, who worked on The Winter Soldier, also signed on for Civil War.[125] In March 2015, Jeremy Renner was revealed to be reprising his role as Clint Barton / Hawkeye.[34] The next month, it was revealed that the film would be converted to 3D in post-production,[126] and that Brühl would be playing Helmut Zemo.[86] Additionally, Elizabeth Olsen revealed she would reprise her role in the film as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch.[51]\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 27, 2015,[126][127] in Fayette County, Georgia, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios,[128] under the working title Sputnik.[129] Other filming locations in the Atlanta metropolitan area included the Buckhead district of Atlanta;[130] the Peachtree Christian Church in Midtown Atlanta;[131] Downtown Atlanta,[132] including an area near Philips Arena known as The Gulch, which served as the market in Lagos;[133] Norcross, Georgia;[130] Porsche's headquarters in Atlanta at Aerotropolis Atlanta, which served as the Avengers' headquarters in the film;[31] and the Atlanta Civic Center, which served as the IFID (Institute for Infectious Diseases) laboratory in Lagos; the latter's interiors doubled as MIT, and a third part was used for a Berlin location.[133] Trent Opaloch served as director of photography,[108] while Chad Stahelski, David Leitch, and The Winter Soldier stuntman Spiro Razatos were second unit directors.[134]\n\nIn early May, Marvel announced that Martin Freeman was cast in an unspecified role,[79] while also reprising roles in the film would be Paul Bettany as Vision, Don Cheadle as James Rhodes / War Machine, Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man, Emily VanCamp as Sharon Carter, and William Hurt as Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross.[32][60] Samuel L. Jackson, who appeared as Nick Fury in the two previous Captain America films, said he was \"surprised\" to discover that he would not be in Captain America: Civil War, after \"the Russo Brothers told [him he] was.\"[135] Moore stated that Fury was not included \"because he didn't add anything to the Civil War story they were telling\",[89] while Markus stated that they did not want him to choose any particular side because \"that's not his place in the universe\".[136] On each of the character's ties to the plot, Anthony Russo said that each character was examined on a personal level to see how they would respond to the idea of registration.[11] On the portrayal of each character, Joe Russo said that he and his brother had strong \"emotional\" and \"psychological connection[s] to [these] characters\" as children, adding, \"We want to reach into that and understand what elementally motivated you to love the character. That's what we try to bring out in the characters now.\" He also mentioned that they were \"trying to honor the feeling of naturalism and to honor the feeling of reality [with the film].\"[71]\n\nAfter the reveal of the film's full cast, many outlets and fans began referring to the film as \"Avengers 2.5 \", given the variety and ensemble nature of the cast, usually reserved for the Avengers films, and the fact that the film no longer felt like a Captain America-centric one, as with The Winter Soldier.[137][138][139][140][141] In response to this, Feige said, \"What's fun about Civil War though is, as you know from the comics, it's a very simple story. And it really has to be, to accommodate that many players. It's very much a Captain America movie and it's very much a sequel to the Winter Soldier in ways I don't think people [will expect].... It's a very simple structure that allows you to have these amazing character interactions in a way that I don't think becomes overwhelming.\"[142] Feige also revealed that Hope van Dyne / Wasp was in an original draft of the film, after receiving the Wasp costume at the end of Ant-Man, but was cut because \"there are so many characters in Civil War that we didn't want to do her a disservice,\" saying Marvel was \"saving\" the character for a better environment to reveal van Dyne in the Wasp costume for the first time and see \"her dynamic with Scott [Lang] in a way it could play out\".[143]\n\nAt the end of May, the Russo brothers, along with Feige and Pascal, held a screen test in Atlanta for six teenage actors that were being eyed for the role of Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the actors testing against Downey and Evans for \"chemistry\";[74][114][144] Tom Holland was cast as the character the next month, to also appear in a solo film.[66] The Russos \"were pretty vocal about who we wanted for the part\", pushing to cast an actor close to the age of Peter Parker in the comics, in order to differentiate from the previous portrayals,[65] with Anthony Russo believing Holland's age was one of the factors Sony was initially hesitant on Holland for the role.[145] They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background.[65] Downey felt of all the actors he tested with, Holland brought \"gravitas and the confidence to be able to take on the mantle\" of portraying Spider-Man.[145]  At the time, Marvel did not confirm his involvement in Civil War,[67][146] due to being contractually obligated not to talk about his inclusion publicly.[65] The Russos discussed this, saying that the various business deals and agreements stemming from the sharing of the character rights, such as on a promotional and commercial level, \"were always lagging slightly behind how we were using the character. We were always in danger of upsetting the deal—there were still sensitive issues going on between the two studios that they needed to agree on.\"[147]\n\nHolland was confirmed to appear in the film in July 2015, by Jonathan M. Goldstein, one of the writers of the solo Spider-Man film,[68] and later by Entertainment Weekly from a set visit.[65] Jon Watts, director of Spider-Man: Homecoming, was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes, in order to \"see what they were doing with it, and that informed where we eventually took it,\" and provide \"ideas about this and that\",[148] such as what Parker's wardrobe and bedroom should look like, \"to make sure we were all on the same page so that [Homecoming] transitions seamlessly with theirs.\"[149] Anthony Russo stated that, despite Marvel telling them to have a \"plan B\" should the deal with Sony fail, the Russos never created one because \"it was very important to us to reintroduce\" Spider-Man in the film, adding, \"We only have envisioned the movie with Spider-Man.\"[150]\n\nBy the end of June, filming reached the halfway mark,[151] with production moving to Germany in early August.[152] Filming locations in Germany included the Olympic Stadium,[153] Potsdamer Platz,[154] Internationales Congress Centrum Berlin and Messe Berlin in Berlin,[153] and the Leipzig/Halle Airport in Schkeuditz.[153] Studio work was done at Babelsberg Studio.[154] Additional filming also took place in Puerto Rico and Norway,[32][124][155] and was scheduled to in Iceland.[32] Principal photography wrapped on August 22, 2015.[156][157]\n\nCaptain America: Civil War was the first film to use IMAX's digital 2D cameras, made in partnership with Arri, which was a customized version of the Arri Alexa 65. According to Joe Russo, approximately fifteen minutes of the film, the sequence where the two factions fight at Leipzig/Halle Airport, which was described as having \"incredible scale to it\" and referred to by the directors as the \"splash panel\", were shot with the cameras.[56][126] Opaloch noted that there were discussions late in pre-production to shoot the entire film with the Alexa 65 cameras. However, because of how close it was to the start of shooting as well as the idea being \"such a large-scale undertaking\", it was decided to only use them for the airport sequence, with the rest of film being shot on Arri Alexa XT digital cameras. For the airport sequence, Opaloch rigged the Alexa 65s to a Technocrane, a Steadicam, a dolly as well as a drone for flyover shots, which had its own dedicated team operating it. Because of the amount of resolution the Alexa 65s offered, Opaloch chose to use medium close-ups instead of close-ups, and for his wide shots, hold the shot a bit longer, \"maybe with a slight camera move that allows the viewer to take it all in.\"[158]\n\nIn September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, who plays Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his character was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed due to the end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not \"want to reveal where [he is] and why\" in this film.[159] Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, \"You've got to kind of choose your roster [of characters] depending on what kind of fight you want to have.\"[65] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear at the very end of the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, \"[The Hulk] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of [Age of] Ultron, and that's a story. Don't blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie.\"[160] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film. They felt that Ross \"was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix.\" Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered.[161]\n\nThat November, Joe Russo stated that the theme of the film was betrayal, calling it \"extremely emotional. [The film] hinges on that emotion, and on a very personal level we didn't want [it] to become about politics and people arguing about platitudes. The third act is built around a very personal moment between [Captain America and Iron Man].\"[11] The Russos spent a great deal of time with Markus, McFeely, and Moore to ensure each character's emotional arc tracked through the entire film correctly, though realized that at some point \"you have to sacrifice logic for expediency\".[89] Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, \"This has been the easiest post process we've ever had on a film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, the tricky thing is the effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards. So everyone starts killing themselves at this point...we'll be done with the movie in two and a half months.\"[111] They also stated that the film would be doing \"a few reshoots\" in mid-to-late January.[111][162]\n\nIn February, Freeman's character was revealed to be Everett K. Ross,[80] and Gwyneth Paltrow was reported to have joined the film for the January reshoots, reprising her role as Pepper Potts;[163] however, in April 2016, it was revealed that Paltrow does not appear in the film,[164] with Anthony Russo explaining that Paltrow's contract with Marvel had ended after Iron Man 3, and \"we decided early on that we could make Pepper's break-up [with Tony Stark] have an emotional impact without actually having a scene with her.\"[12] On March 16, 2016, the Russos stated the film was \"about a week and a half away from\" completion,[165] with Joe adding that the film would have a post-credits scene, with the possibility for two or three total.[72] The film was completed on April 4, 2016.[166] Later in April, Alfre Woodard and Jim Rash were revealed to be cast in the film,[96] while Feige explained that Black Panther director Ryan Coogler contributed some dialogue for Black Panther in several scenes during reshoots.[167] At the film's premiere, it was revealed that Marisa Tomei appears in the film as May Parker, Peter Parker's aunt.[63]\n\nNearly 20 visual effects studios worked on Captain America: Civil War including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, DNEG, Image Engine, Trixter, Cinesite, and The Third Floor amongst others. Lola VFX de-aged Downey Jr. in a scene that involved a younger holographic version of himself. Lola VFX's visual effects supervisor, Trent Claus said, \"In this case, we analyzed footage of Mr. Downey at the approximate age that we wanted to target, which was around the time of the film Less than Zero [when Downey was in his early 20s].\" He also noted the difficulty of the scene, due to it being close to 4,000 frames, and the fact that Downey was moving his head from side to side multiple times. Lola also worked on visual effects for the Vision.[155] The Third Floor extensively previsualized the film including the fight scene at Leipzig/Halle Airport. Gerardo Ramirez, the Previs and Postvis Supervisor for The Third Floor said:\n\nWe visualized most of the major scenes in the film, some that were more story driven and some that were more action and story driven. The Russos used various methods for planning and they used each department for what it does best. The early edits were a combination of storyboards, previs and stunt performance clips. Stunts would choreograph the hand-to-hand action while the storyboards would be used for character story moments and previs was used for the big action scenes that involved many digital characters.[155]\nMethod Studios, which worked on 440 shots, was responsible for the helicopter sequence in the middle of the film and the climactic fight between Iron Man, Bucky, and Captain America. The original intent for the helicopter sequence was to place the scene next to the Paul-Löbe-Haus, where the Bundestag meets; however, the location was not allowed to be shown in the film, resulting in Method needing to create a full CGI background. For the climactic fight, one of the challenges for Method was getting the color of Iron Man's suit correct, opting to go with a more \"classic Iron Man look versus the really glossy car paint look\" that Iron Man had in the previous Avengers films. ILM was primarily responsible for the visual effects during the large-scale fight sequence at the airport, along with creating the digital assets for all of the characters. VFX supervisor Russell Earl, stated that the 20-minute scene grew to be an almost fully digital sequence explaining, \"We ultimately ended up replacing 99% of everything that was shot with the actors being lifted from the background. Originally both Spider-Man and Black Panther were planned to be photographed elements but we ended up almost completely replacing them.\" Luma Pictures, who also worked on The Winter Soldier, was assigned with completing shots of Bucky's arm and his metal brainwashing chair. They also worked on Bucky's escape from the task force lobby and designed Iron Man's new hybrid nanotechnology armor, which was an homage to the character's Bleeding Edge armor from the comics. Their work totaled approximately 200 shots.[155] Spider-Man was a digital double for all of his appearances, featuring his finalized suit; on-set, Holland wore a temporary Spider-Man suit that featured raised webbing and a different spider emblem, or a motion capture suit.[168]\n\nDesign firm Sarofsky once again worked on the film's main-on-end title sequence, having done the same for The Winter Soldier. The sequence used \"muted and mottled, burnt umber and steel blue and cold grey\" colors, which were stark contrasts to the sequences for The Winter Soldier and The First Avenger (the latter created by Method Design) which were \"a minimalist graphic approach, reducing the key players to silhouettes and paring the palette down to three colors\" and \"vibrant and iconic propaganda art comes to life, enticing the viewer to join the fray\", respectively. Creative director Erin Sarofsky noted one of the challenges for Civil War's sequence was \"to make it feel like a Captain America title sequence and not an Avengers sequence\" given the number of characters in the film.[169]\n\nHenry Jackman returned from The Winter Soldier to score the sequel.[170] He found the movie to be tonally different from the previous one, which necessitated a much more symphonic and orchestral score. This culminates in the final fight between Captain America, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man, the music for which Jackman described as \"somewhat operatic and ... almost classical in its style\".[171] Though Jackman reprised and developed his themes for Captain America and the Winter Soldier from the previous film,[172][173] and introduced motifs for the new characters Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Zemo,[171] he was wary of pushing the audience to one side of the central conflict or the other by using character-specific music; Jackman composed a new main theme for the film to represent the Civil War, \"a generic theme to balance everything out\",[174] \"toward which all the characters can gravitate. It wrapped them all up and it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes.\"[175] Jackman also wrote a thriller theme that appears whenever the mystery surrounding Zemo's plan is explored. This was inspired by the works of Jerry Goldsmith.[172] The score was released on a soundtrack album by Hollywood Records on May 6, 2016.[176]\n\nIn early July 2015, Marvel began a viral marketing campaign for Ant-Man featuring Leslie Bibb, reprising her role from the Iron Man films as journalist Christine Everhart, reporting for the faux news program, WHIH Newsfront. In one program, Everhart discusses events leading to Captain America: Civil War.[177] The post-credits scene for Ant-Man featured footage shot by the Russo brothers for Captain America: Civil War,[178][179] showing Wilson and Rogers with Barnes in their custody, and unable to contact Stark because of \"the accords\"; Wilson mentions that he \"know[s] a guy\", implying Lang.[180] Feige explained that when the post-credit sequence appears in Civil War it may appear with \"different takes...different angles.\"[178] Stan said the scene was shot in early May 2015, and would appear in the middle of Civil War.[27] The first footage of the film debuted in August 2015 at the D23 Expo.[29] Additional footage was shown in September 2015 at the Asia Pop Comic Convention.[181] The footage shown at the D23 Expo and 2015 Asia Pop Comic Convention received an overwhelmingly positive response from the audiences.[182]\n\nThe first trailer for the film debuted on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on November 25, 2015, and within hours became the number one trending topic on Twitter.[183] The trailer was viewed 61 million times in the first 24 hours of release, surpassing the 34 million views of Avengers: Age of Ultron's in 2014.[184] Scott Mendelson of Forbes called the trailer a \"doozy\" and noted that the early debut ahead of the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a \"good show\" on behalf of Disney as it was \"a way to not get lost amid the 8,000 other trailers debuting with Star Wars\". Mendelson also noted that based on the trailer's content, the film was being \"sold as Captain America 3, as opposed to Avengers 2.5 or Iron Man 4,\" which could help keep the film's box office expectations in check.[185]\n\nOn February 4, 2016, Marvel released their own version of the Facebook \"#FriendsDay\" video for Captain America. The video mirrors those created by Facebook for users to celebrate the anniversary of Facebook's founding, and features images of Captain America's \"friends\" the Winter Soldier, Thor, Falcon and Hawkeye. The video concludes with an image of Captain America and Iron Man being torn in half. Jennifer Konerman of The Hollywood Reporter called the video \"timely\" and its contents \"especially relevant considering the storyline\" of Civil War.[186] Three days later, a teaser debuted during Super Bowl 50, which received the most social media activity out of all the film trailers released that day.[187][188] Anthony Breznican of Entertainment Weekly said the footage \"actually feels a little more like a teaser [than a full trailer], since it shows some new shots, but really doesn't reveal much more about the story.\" Additionally, he felt the chanting \"unseen voices calling out, 'United...We...Stand' and 'Divided...We...Fall'\" had \"a football stadium vibe\", complimenting it appearing during the Super Bowl.[189] Mendelson added that Marvel did not need to follow the model used for The Winter Soldier during Super Bowl XLVIII of showing a longer trailer after the teaser since Civil War was \"frankly [a] higher-profile sequel.\" Overall, Mendelson felt the spot was \"only a little less low-key and small(er)-scale as the trailer that debuted in\" November 2015, and sold the \"real world\" aspect \"with character drama and mostly real-world action between would-be superheroes.\"[190]\n\nFour days later, on Valentine's Day, the Facebook campaign was continued, with Marvel creating a \"faux-status update\" for Captain America, showing his relationship status had changed to \"In a Complicated Relationship with Iron Man\".[191] At The Walt Disney Company's annual shareholder meeting in the Auditorium Theatre in March, CEO Bob Iger presented a clip from the film to \"generous applause\".[192] From March 7 to 10, Marvel released individual posters for characters in the film,[193] continued its Facebook campaign with two teaser videos showcasing the participants on \"Team Cap\" and \"Team Iron Man\", and released a second trailer.[194] The trailer was viewed close to 95 million times within the first 24 hours of release, surpassing the views achieved by the first trailer. In addition, 240,000 social media posts across Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and Facebook, among others, were made related to the trailer, surpassing the 81,000 the Age of Ultron trailer received in 2014.[195] According to internet analytics firm ZEFR, the trailer was viewed over 62 million times from YouTube and Facebook over four days, making it the second most viewed trailer at the time, behind the 64.6 million views for the first Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer.[196] It also became the top trailer in 2016 through March 13, 2016, according to research firm ListenFirst, for receiving the most likes, retweets and other engagement on Twitter.[197] The trailer continued to be the top viewed trailer on YouTube and Facebook for three straight weeks according to ZEFR, receiving more than 96 million total views since its release.[198]\n\nMendelson called the trailer \"a textbook case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone out there who watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?\" He added that he was \"a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal,\"[199] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the \"courage\" to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the \"Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz\".[193] Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving \"us more explanation [and context] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man\",[200] and by including Spider-Man since \"there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven to go out to the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [Spider-Man] because it's the sort of value-added element that can make [a] difference\".[200] Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal \"alone makes the trailer\", describing it as feeling \"like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be.\"[201]\n\nWith the film seemingly continuing plot threads first introduced in Age of Ultron, Mendelson wondered \"to what extent the whole 'Consequences galore!' narrative of Civil War will improve Age of Ultron. As much great stuff as that movie has ... [it ultimately shows] the main hero foolishly/recklessly [bring] a world-killing threat to Earth and lots of really bad stuff goes down and yet no one seems to care at the end ... What does it mean if Civil War does retroactively improve Age of Ultron? Will we be at a point where we really can't judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix the flaws a couple years down the line?\"[199] McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was \"in an awkward place with Civil War\" regarding superhero destruction moving forward. He wondered how superhero oversight would \"actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules\" as well. \"Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [should now be] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing on the other side of that wall. After Civil War, can Marvel go back to pretending that everyone is okay after any large scale event ever again?\"[201]\n\nAlso in March, Marvel, in partnership with the National Academy of Sciences Science & Entertainment Exchange, Dolby Laboratories, Broadcom, and Synchrony Bank, announced the \"Girls Reforming the Future Challenge\", aimed at females aged 15 through 18 in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) fields, to submit projects they feel can change the world and have far-reaching effects. Five winners would attend the world premiere at the Dolby Theatre, and receive a tour of Walt Disney Studios and a $500 saving account from Synchrony Bank, with one grand prize winner receiving an internship at Marvel Studios.[202] On April 10, Evans debuted an exclusive clip of the film during the 2016 MTV Movie Awards.[203] Throughout the month, the Russo brothers and the cast promoted the film in Paris, Beijing, Singapore, Berlin and London.[204] At the end of the month, Marvel released additional viral marketing videos of WHIH Newsfront, featuring Bibb once again reprising her role as Everhart. In the program, Everhart discusses with \"political analyst\" Will Adams, portrayed by Al Madrigal, the cost the Avengers bring for saving the world, and if they should have regulation from the government.[205] Additional Newsfront segments saw William Sadler reprise his role as President Matthew Ellis, including an \"exclusive\" interview and his reaction to the incident involving the Avengers in Lagos.[206][207] On May 2, 2016, Evans, Renner, and executives from Marvel rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange in honor of the film's theatrical release.[208]\n\nAt the 2015 Licensing International Expo, Disney Consumer Products announced that they would partner with licensees including Hasbro, Lego, Funko, Hot Wheels, Rubies, Mad Engine, C-Life, Jay Franco, Global Brand Group, Kellogg's, Hallmark and American Greetings to sell merchandise related to the film;[209] Coca-Cola,[210] Google, Samsung, Wrigley, Harley Davidson, Audi, Synchrony Financial, Pringles, Keebler, Pizza Hut, Pop Secret, Mouser Electronics, and Vivo, among other brands, were also licensees for the film.[211] Paul Gitter, senior VP of licensing for Marvel at Disney Consumer Products said that they will build off the success of licensed products for Avengers: Age of Ultron, including a focus on a celebration of Captain America's 75th anniversary, female apparel, healthy living and travel, and on marketing newer characters such as War Machine, Falcon, Vision, Black Widow and Black Panther. \"The Avengers team is both aspirational and hugely merchandisable, made up of multiple, unique heroes coming together with amazing skills, cool vehicles and a high tech headquarters,\" said Gitter. \"Captain America: Civil War not only gives us new storytelling for our favorite superheroes, but also introduces new ones allowing us to expand product lines for kids and fans.\"[209] As part of the $200 million marketing effort for the film, Harley Davidson created two customized motorcycles for the film, Audi debuted a commercial directed by the Russos featuring unreleased scenes from the film, while Pizza Hut debuted collectible boxes and Kellogg's, Pringles, and Keebler products featured virtual reality experiences. The lead-up to the film's release culminated in a massive online vote across Google, YouTube, and Twitter for either Team Captain America or Team Iron Man.[211]\n\nMarvel Comics released a four-issue comic prelude by writer Will Corona Pilgrim and artist Szymon Kudranski, beginning in December 2015, that adapted the events of Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier.[212] On February 10, Marvel Comics released another comic prelude, a single-issue infinite comic set between The Winter Soldier and Civil War.[213] Written again by Pilgrim, the comic is told from the perspectives of Barnes, Rumlow, and Rogers, showing how each ended up where they begin Civil War. Art for each character's perspective is provided by Lee Ferguson, Goran Sudžuka, and Guillermo Mogorron, respectively.[214]\n\nCaptain America: Civil War premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 12, 2016,[202] and was screened at CinemaCon 2016 on April 13.[215] The film's Southeast Asia premiere was held on April 21 at the Marina Bay Sands resort in Singapore,[216] while the European premiere took place at Vue Cinemas in Westfield London on April 26.[217] The film was released internationally starting from April 27,[199] releasing in 61 countries its first weekend,[218] including the United Kingdom on April 29.[219] The North America release on May 6,[107] took place in over 4,200 theaters, of which 3,300 were in 3D, along with 378 IMAX theaters, 480 premium large-format, and 161 D-Box locations.[220] Internationally, the film opened in 955 IMAX theaters,[221] while South Korea saw Civil War open in an \"unprecedented\" 1,989 theaters.[222] Captain America: Civil War was the first film released in Phase Three of the MCU.[100] In September 2014, TNT acquired the cable broadcast rights for Captain America: Civil War to air two years after its theatrical release.[223]\n\nCaptain America: Civil War was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on September 2, 2016, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D and DVD on September 13, 2016. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, and an exclusive preview of Doctor Strange.[224] The digital release comes with an exclusive \"mockumentary\" short film, Team Thor, directed by Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi, which was originally screened at San Diego Comic-Con 2016 and showed what Thor was doing during the events of Civil War.[225][226] Captain America: Civil War was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on April 23, 2019.[227] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[228]\n\nCaptain America: Civil War grossed $408.1 million in the U.S. and Canada and $745.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.153 billion.[4] By May 10, 2016, the film had grossed $737.8 million, surpassing the entire theatrical gross of its predecessor, Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($714.4 million).[229] It became the highest-grossing film of 2016,[230][231] the fourth-highest-grossing superhero film of all time,[232] and the third-highest-grossing film in the U.S. and Canada of 2016, behind Rogue One and Finding Dory.[233] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $193.4 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it eighth on their list of 2016's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[3]\n\nTwo weeks ahead of its release, Fandango announced that the film outsold all previous Marvel Cinematic Universe films at the same point in the sales cycle,[234] and by its opening week, had reached the highest advance sales for a superhero film, representing 90% of the site's weekend ticket sales.[235] Captain America: Civil War earned $75.5 million on its opening day. The film's Friday gross included $25 million from Thursday previews, the second-highest Thursday preview gross among Marvel films, with $3.1 million of the $25 million coming from IMAX theaters, a new Marvel record. The film went on to earn $61.2 million on Saturday and $42.4 million on Sunday, for a total opening weekend gross of $179.1 million, the third-highest for a Marvel film and fifth-highest of all time. Of the $179.1 million, $16 million was from IMAX, the second best for an MCU film.[236] Initial projections for Captain America: Civil War had it earning between $175–200 million on its opening weekend,[237][238] with the projection being revised to $172–178 million after Friday.[236] BoxOffice called it \"the safest box office bet\" since Star Wars: The Force Awakens.[239] The film remained at number one in its second weekend,[240] and fell to second in its third, behind The Angry Birds Movie.[241] In its fourth weekend, Captain America: Civil War became the highest-grossing film of 2016 in North America,[242] and by June 17, 2016, became the first film of 2016 to surpass $400 million.[243]\n\nCaptain America: Civil War's opening in 15 countries on April 27, 2016, earned $14.9 million,[218] followed by $23.8 million the next day from 15 more countries, and $45.3 million two days later from 8 additional countries, for a three-day total of $84 million.[244] Its first weekend brought a total of $200.4 million,[221] after being projected to earn anywhere between $180–250 million,[245] with $9.4 million coming from IMAX. The film debuted at number one in all countries except Japan.[221] The film stayed at number one in its second weekend, earning $217 million, with existing territories seeing a 55% decline in earnings, while surpassing the entire international earnings of previous Captain America films, along with other MCU films. For IMAX in its second weekend, Captain America: Civil War earned $31 million, a new record for a day-and-date opening for a Marvel film.[246] By its third weekend, the film remained at number one in some territories, being overtaken by The Angry Birds Movie in others, and became the top film of 2016 and fourth-highest-grossing superhero film outside of North America.[247]\n\nIt set records for the largest opening day in Mexico ($7.3 million),[244] opening day of 2016 in France ($2.4 million),[218] the second-largest opening day in Brazil ($2.7 million)[244] and the United Arab Emirates,[246] the largest superhero opening day in the Netherlands,[244] and the largest superhero opening in Turkey and Ukraine.[246] It set opening weekend records in Brazil ($12.9 million), Mexico ($20.4 million), and the Philippines ($7.7 million), and was the second-largest opening weekend in Hong Kong ($6.9 million) and Thailand ($9.4 million). In the United Kingdom, the film earned the second-largest opening day and weekend of 2016 with $20.5 million, while France had the top 2016 opening weekend with $10.1 million. Germany had the best four-day opening of 2016 with $8.1 million, and Spain had the second-largest three-day opening of 2016 with $4.2 million.[221] For South Korea, the film was the largest non-Korean opening and largest Marvel opening in history.[222] China had the second best IMAX opening ($9.5 million), as well as the second-largest opening weekend for a Hollywood film ($95.6 million),[246] with the film eventually becoming the third-highest Disney release in the country after 10 days,[247] and the second largest superhero film.[232] Japan saw the film open third with $4.2 million, behind Detective Conan: The Darkest Nightmare ($5.3 million) and Zootopia ($4.8 million).[248] The film's largest markets were China ($190.4 million), South Korea ($62.8 million), and the United Kingdom ($53.2 million).[249]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 91%, with an average score of 7.7/10, based on 430 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Captain America: Civil War begins the next wave of Marvel movies with an action-packed superhero blockbuster boasting a decidedly non-cartoonish plot and the courage to explore thought-provoking themes.\"[250] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 75 out of 100 based on 53 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[251] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an \"A\" grade on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 88% overall positive score and a 75% \"definite recommend\".[236]\n\nJustin Chang of Variety called it \"the most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"[252] Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"Call it 'civil war' or call it brand extension; call it a 'cinematic universe' or a corporate behemoth—the latest Marvel extravaganza furthers the studio's cross-pollination of action franchises in a way that's sure to satisfy devotees.\"[253] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph wrote, \"This is the cinematic superhero showdown you've dreamt of since childhood, precisely because that's everything—and all—it wants to be.\"[254] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian called it, \"a huge aspartame rush of a film: a giant irresistible snack, not nutritious, but very tasty.\"[255] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \"Kudos to co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo and the team of writers for juggling more than a dozen comic-book characters and nearly that many plot lines, and only occasionally getting us (and by us I mean me) lost in the geek weeds.\"[256] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, \"If you live and breathe Marvel, this is one of the MCU's stronger offerings. If you are a spy coming in from the cold, the answer is not so clear.\"[257] A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, \"Captain America: Civil War does not in any way transcend the conventions of the genre. On the contrary: It succeeds because it doesn't really try.\"[258]\n\nConversely, Stephen Whitty of the New York Daily News said, \"Although it's called Captain America: Civil War, the latest Marvel movie is actually a supersized Avengers picture—overstuffed to bursting. And sometimes during its two and a half hour running time, it just goes bust.\"[259] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \"As a work of thought, Civil War is compromised, but at least there are thoughts to compromise. As an action film, it has its moments, but aside from the big opening sequence—the action scenes are a bit flat.\"[260] Andrew O'Hehir writing for Salon said, \"Much of Captain America: Civil War is just the laborious working-out of leftover dangling plot elements from Captain America: The Winter Soldier two summers ago.\"[261] While Nicholas Barber of the BBC gave the film a generally favorable review, praising both its visuals and action sequences, he criticized the fact that there was \"no cogent reason for any of [the Avengers] to be on one side or the other, which is why their inevitable dust-up feels like a game of dodgeball in a school playground.\"[262] Mark Millar, writer of the \"Civil War\" comic storyline on which the film was based, felt the film \"had a good opening twenty [minutes], but then I honestly can't remember what the movie was about.\" He also felt the film lacked levity, especially considering the Russo brothers' background in comedy.[263]\n\nAccording to Feige, Civil War is the conclusion of the Captain America trilogy that began with The First Avenger.[274] While it is the final standalone Captain America film in Evans' contract with Marvel Studios,[275] Evans said in September 2015 that he was open to extending his contract past Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, the final films on his contract at the time.[276] In November 2018, Joe Russo said that Evans was \"not done yet\" with Captain America after Endgame.[277] In November 2019, when asked if he would reprise the role of Captain America, Evans responded, \"You never say never. I love the character. I don't know,\" and added, \"It's not a hard no, but it's not an eager yes either.\"[278] In January 2021, Evans was reportedly close to signing a deal to reprise the role of Captain America in at least one future project. Evans' involvement was said to be similar to how Downey had supporting roles in other film franchises, such as Civil War, after concluding the Iron Man film series with Iron Man 3 (2013).[279] Evans soon said the report was \"news to [him]\".[280] His potential return would be in a project separate from the fourth Captain America film in development.[281] The planned solo film was believed to have also included Hayley Atwell, also reprising her role as Peggy Carter, however Marvel Studios was unable to get the story for the film to a place to proceed with its development. Instead, by late 2024, the studio believed their next Avengers films, Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027), were better opportunities to revisit the characters; both Evans and Atwell were expected to reprise their roles in Doomsday.[282] Evans also appeared in Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), reprising his pre-MCU role of Johnny Storm / Human Torch from 20th Century Fox's Fantastic Four (2005) and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007).[283]\n\nOne of Marvel Studios' Disney+ miniseries, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, was released in 2021, with Malcolm Spellman serving as head writer and Kari Skogland directing. It centered on Mackie's Sam Wilson / Falcon and Stan's Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, with Cheadle, Brühl, VanCamp, and Kasumba reprising their roles as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes, Helmut Zemo, Sharon Carter, and Ayo, respectively, along with Georges St-Pierre as Georges Batroc from Captain America: The Winter Soldier.\n\nA fourth film, Captain America: Brave New World, is scheduled to be released on February 14, 2025,[284] directed by Julius Onah,[285] and written by Spellman, Dalan Musson (a series writer on The Falcon and the Winter Soldier),[286] and Matthew Orton.[287] It serves as a continuation of the events of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, focusing on Sam Wilson.[286] Mackie,[288] Danny Ramirez, and Carl Lumbly reprise their respective roles of Wilson, Joaquin Torres, and Isaiah Bradley from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,[289] along with Tim Blake Nelson and Liv Tyler reprising their roles as Samuel Sterns / Leader and Betty Ross from The Incredible Hulk (2008).[289][290] Shira Haas appears as Ruth Bat-Seraph,[291] while Harrison Ford appears as Thaddeus Ross, replacing Hurt following his death in 2022.[292]\n"

        "content": "\n\nDoctor Strange is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 14th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Scott Derrickson from a screenplay he wrote with Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as neurosurgeon Stephen Strange along with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg, Benjamin Bratt, Scott Adkins, Mads Mikkelsen, and Tilda Swinton. In the film, Strange learns the mystic arts after a career-ending car crash.\n\nVarious incarnations of a Doctor Strange film adaptation had been in development since the mid-1980s, until Paramount Pictures acquired the film rights in April 2005 on behalf of Marvel Studios. Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer were brought on board in June 2010 to write a screenplay. In June 2014, Derrickson was hired to direct, with Spaihts re-writing the script. Cumberbatch was chosen for the eponymous role in December 2014, necessitating a schedule change to work around his other commitments. This gave Derrickson time to work on the script himself, for which he brought Cargill on to help. Principal photography on the film began in November 2015 in Nepal, before moving to England and Hong Kong, and wrapping up in New York City in April 2016.\n\nDoctor Strange had its world premiere in Hong Kong on October 13, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 4, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film grossed $677.8 million worldwide and was met with praise for its cast, visual effects, and musical score. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. A sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, was released in May 2022.\n\nIn Kathmandu, the sorcerer Kaecilius and his zealots enter the secret compound Kamar-Taj and behead its librarian. They steal several pages from a book belonging to the Ancient One, a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape.\n\nIn New York City, Dr. Stephen Strange, a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant neurosurgeon, severely injures his hands in a car crash while en route to a speaking conference, leaving him permanently unable to operate. Fellow surgeon Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius.\n\nStrange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient texts in the library that are now guarded by Master Wong. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three Sanctums in New York City, London, and Hong Kong, which are all directly accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only to heal his paralysis. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the book from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the Eye of Agamotto. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life.\n\nKaecilius uses the stolen pages to contact Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time is non-existent, and destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off with the help of the Cloak of Levitation, only to be critically injured during a skirmish. He teleports himself back to the hospital where Palmer saves him. Upon returning to the Sanctum, Strange reveals to Mordo that the Ancient One has been drawing power from the Dark Dimension to sustain long life, and Mordo becomes disillusioned with her. After a fight in the Mirror Dimension of New York, Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he and Mordo will have to work together to defeat Kaecilius, balancing Mordo's steadfast nature against Strange's willingness to bend the rules. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then enters the Dark Dimension and creates an endless time loop around himself and Dormammu. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally accepts his bargain, leaving Earth permanently and taking Kaecilius and the zealots with him in exchange for Strange breaking the loop.\n\nDisgusted by Strange and the Ancient One defying nature's laws, Mordo renounces his sorcerer career and departs. Strange returns the Eye, which is revealed to hold an Infinity Stone, back to Kamar-Taj and takes up residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies with Wong. In a mid-credits scene, Strange decides to help Thor, who has brought his brother Loki to Earth to search for their father, Odin.[a] In a post-credits scene, Mordo confronts Pangborn and steals the mystical energy he uses, telling him that Earth has \"too many sorcerers\".\n\nCumberbatch also portrays, uncredited, the villainous entity Dormammu. The actor suggested he take on the role to Derrickson, feeling that having the character be a \"horrific\" reflection of Strange would work better than just \"being a big ghoulish monster\". The director agreed, elaborating that the casting implies that Dormammu does not have a normal physical form in his own dimension, and so is simply imitating Strange for their confrontation. To create the character, Cumberbatch provided motion-capture reference for the visual effects team, and his voice was blended with that of another uncredited British actor, whom Derrickson described as having \"a very deep voice\".[14][53] The producers also had Tony Todd record voice over for Dormammu as an alternative to Cumberbatch, but ultimately decided on using Cumberbatch for the voice.[54]\n\nChris Hemsworth reprises his role of Thor from previous MCU films in the film's mid-credits scene.[55] Additionally, Linda Louise Duan appears, unnamed, as Tina Minoru,[56][57] Mark Anthony Brighton portrays Daniel Drumm,[55] and Topo Wresniwiro portrays Hamir,[58] all Masters of the Mystic Arts under the Ancient One. The latter is based on Hamir the Hermit, Wong's father in the comics, who was the Ancient One's personal manservant. The character is neither a manservant nor Wong's father in the film.[14] Zara Phythian, Alaa Safi, and Katrina Durden portray zealots under Kaecilius,[38][58][59] and Pat Kiernan appears as himself.[60] Doctor Strange comic writer Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance as a bus rider reading Aldous Huxley's The Doors of Perception.[61][62] Amy Landecker was cast as anesthesiologist Bruner, but the majority of her role was cut from the finished film.[58][63]\n\nA film based on the Marvel Comics character Doctor Strange was initially listed as being in development at New World Pictures,[64] with a script dated January 21, 1986, by Bob Gale, which never went further into production.[65] By 1989, Alex Cox had co-written a script with Marvel comic's Stan Lee. The script had the character traveling to the Fourth Dimension before facing the villain Dormammu on Easter Island, Chile. A film using this script was almost made by Regency, but Regency's films were distributed by Warner Bros. at the time, which was in a dispute with Marvel over merchandising.[66] Around this time, producer Charles Band optioned the property from Marvel and began developing a film at his studio Full Moon Entertainment. However, the option expired before production could begin and the project was reworked into the 1992 film Doctor Mordrid, whose titular character bore similarities to Doctor Strange.[67]  By December 1992, Wes Craven had signed to write and direct Doctor Strange for release in either 1994 or 1995, with Savoy Pictures distributing.[68][69] In 1995, David S. Goyer had completed a script for the film.[70] By April 1997, Columbia Pictures had purchased the film rights and Jeff Welch was working on a new screenplay, with Bernie Brillstein and Brad Grey producing.[71]\n\nBy April 2000, Columbia dropped Doctor Strange, which then had Michael France attached to write a script and interest from Chuck Russell and Stephen Norrington to direct.[72] By June 2001, Dimension Films acquired the film rights, with Goyer back on board as writer and director. Goyer hinted scheduling conflicts might ensue with a film adaptation of Murder Mysteries,[73] and promised not to be highly dependent on computer-generated imagery.[70] However, by August 2001, Miramax Films acquired the film rights from Dimension Films,[74] and by March 2002, Goyer had dropped out of the project.[75] A 2005 release date was announced the next March,[76] while in June 2004, a script still had yet to be written. Marvel Studios CEO Avi Arad stated, \"We are nowhere with that. That's a tough one to write, but we are working on it. We are trying to find the real Jerry Garcia of the writing community.\"[77] In April 2005, Paramount Pictures acquired Doctor Strange from Miramax Films, as part of Marvel Studios' attempt to independently produce their own films. At the time, the film was projected to have a budget of no more than $165 million.[78] In 2007, Guillermo del Toro and Neil Gaiman pitched a version of the film to Marvel, with Gaiman writing and del Toro directing.[79] Their version would have seen the character be alcoholic and a disbarred physician in the late 1920s or early 1930s, and he would have been living in Greenwich Village for 90 years without aging. It would have also been heavily inspired by the art of Steve Ditko.[80] Gaiman was especially interested in including the character Clea, but the studio was not interested.[79]\n\nIn March 2009, Marvel hired writers to help come up with creative ways to launch its lesser-known properties, including Doctor Strange.[81] In June 2010, Marvel Studios hired Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer to write Doctor Strange.[82] While promoting Transformers: Dark of the Moon in April 2011, actor Patrick Dempsey indicated he was lobbying to play the title character.[83] In January 2013, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige confirmed that Doctor Strange would appear in some capacity as part of Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[84] Feige then reiterated that a Doctor Strange feature film was in development at Marvel Studios that May,[85][86] and again in November.[87] In February 2014, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Marvel was considering Mark Andrews, Jonathan Levine, Nikolaj Arcel and Dean Israelite to direct the film, and was considering Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger to rewrite the film's script.[88] Feige denied this report, but confirmed that Marvel was considering prospective candidates.[89] By March, Marvel was considering Andrews, Levine, and Scott Derrickson to direct the film.[90]\n\nI think when you consider the work that I've done it makes sense that he'd be my favorite comic book character, at least in the Marvel universe. Probably the only comic character in that mainstream world that I'm suited to. I feel such an affinity for the character and the story and the ambition of those comics, especially the original Stan Lee and Steve Ditko Strange Tales—I think those are my favorite of all of them. The entire history of the comics is extraordinary.\n\nIn June 2014, Derrickson was chosen to direct the film.[92] He had written a 12-page scene for the film featuring Strange and an assailant fighting in the astral plane while a doctor attempts to save Strange's physical body in a hospital, based on a sequence from the comic Doctor Strange: The Oath. Derrickson illustrated the sequence with his own concept art, alongside storyboards from professional artists and an animatic, which he presented in a 90-minute pitch to the studio. This cost Derrickson an \"obnoxious amount\" of his own money, but he felt it necessary to prove \"that I wanted [the job] more than anyone\", especially after Marvel told him that more people had lobbied to direct Doctor Strange than any of their other films.[93][94] Derrickson ultimately had eight meetings with Marvel for the film.[95] After he was hired, Marvel bought the 12-page scene from Derrickson, and it became one of the film's main set pieces.[93][94]\n\nOn transitioning from horror films to a superhero film, Derrickson said, \"It was nice to work on something more positive. And not have my headspace in something so dark for so long. But it was also weirdly similar because of the fantastical nature of the movie\". In his horror films, Derrickson tried to use \"real characters and real character drama played by good actors ... [to] encounter the fantastical\", and so he wanted actors of the same high caliber for Doctor Strange through which he could introduce the more fantastical elements to the MCU.[96]\n\nDerrickson and Marvel had originally discussed him writing the film alongside his Sinister co-writer C. Robert Cargill, with Derrickson also directing, but Marvel felt that they would not be able to reach their intended release date of July 2016 if Derrickson filled both roles. When Derrickson was chosen as director, Marvel passed on Cargill as an individual writer,[47] with Jon Spaihts hired to rewrite the script instead.[7][97] Spaihts, a big fan of Doctor Strange as a child, had started \"pestering\" Marvel as soon as he read reports of the company searching for a director for the film. This eventually led to him meeting with the studio, before they actually began looking for writers for the film. Spaihts said that they talked \"all afternoon, and the fit was right\",[98] but he received a call from Marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take the film in the same direction as Spaihts, and were going to look at other writers. Spaihts told his agent to not \"take that answer. Call them back, tell them there's a lot of right answers, and get me back in the room\", and after talking with Marvel for \"another three or four hours\" he was given the job. Marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for the film.[95]\n\nDerrickson was already hired when Spaihts joined, and the pair spent several months working on the film's story with Feige and executive producer Stephen Broussard. They started writing the film from the beginning, and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story, or if it would begin with Strange already as a \"fully-formed\" sorcerer. Spaihts ultimately felt that \"the origin story of this character, as depicted in the comics, is so operatic and beautiful, and so tragic and epic in its sweep, that it was unavoidable. We had to tell that story, and tell our best version of it.\" Elements from Spaihts' early drafts that he later stated were still in the final film include many of the film's set pieces, such as the climactic battle, which came straight from Derrickson, as well as \"little things\" from Spaihts, \"like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a Nepalese temple.\"[98] Derrickson wanted Nightmare to be the film's antagonist, along with the concept of \"nightmares themselves as being a dimension\",[22][99] but Feige felt \"getting across the idea of the Dream Dimension as another dimension\" would have been challenging alongside everything else that the film introduces. Dormammu, \"the most present villain in the comics\", became the film's main villain.[22]\n\nDuring the early development process, Marvel, Derrickson, and Spaihts all envisioned Benedict Cumberbatch playing the title role.[98] By the end of June, Marvel had reportedly been looking at Tom Hardy and Jared Leto for the film's lead as well,[97][100] while Édgar Ramírez, who worked with Derrickson on 2014's Deliver Us from Evil, had discussed a possible role with the director.[101] In July, after fans and the media had also championed Cumberbatch for the role of Doctor Strange, the actor explained at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con that he would be unable to accept the role due to commitments to other projects.[102] Feige stated that a lead actor would be announced \"relatively quickly\",[103] and by the end of that month Joaquin Phoenix entered talks to play the character.[104][105]\n\nMarvel Studios was in negotiations by September 2014 to shoot Doctor Strange at Pinewood-Shepperton in England, with crews being assembled for a move into Shepperton Studios in late 2014/early 2015, for filming in May 2015.[106] Negotiations with Phoenix ended in October 2014,[107] as the actor felt that blockbuster films would never be \"fulfilling\", with \"too many requirements that went against [his] instincts for character.\"[108] Marvel then placed Leto, Ethan Hawke, Oscar Isaac, Ewan McGregor, Matthew McConaughey, Jake Gyllenhaal, Colin Farrell, and Keanu Reeves on their shortlist for the character.[109][110] Ryan Gosling also had discussions to play the character,[111] while Reeves was not approached about the role,[112] and Cumberbatch was still considered to be in contention.[109][110] In October, Cumberbatch entered negotiations to play the character,[113] and was officially cast in December.[7] Feige explained that Marvel had kept returning to him for the role while considering other actors,[114] with Derrickson noting that even during discussions with Phoenix, he and Marvel still wanted to cast Cumberbatch in the role.[94] The company eventually decided to change the film's production schedule to fit around Cumberbatch's commitments, allowing him to join the project.[114]\n\nWith the film's new production schedule, its intended release date was pushed back to November 2016,[115] and Derrickson was able to do some work on the script himself. He brought Cargill in to work with him on this as was originally planned. Describing the film, Cargill called it both a superhero film and a fantasy film, saying \"it's a very magical fantasy universe, but at the same time it plays by some of the superhero tropes that people enjoy.\"[47] Spaihts returned later in the process to \"do some more writing and help bring the movie home\", and said he was \"delighted\" by the work that Derrickson and Cargill had done in the interim.[95] Feige and Derrickson have noted that, in addition to The Oath and Steve Ditko's original work on Doctor Strange, an influence on all the film's writers was the Doctor Strange comic book Into Shamballa.[32][42][116]\n\nIn January 2015, Chiwetel Ejiofor entered preliminary talks with Marvel for a role in the film,[117] later revealed to be Karl Mordo.[18] Ejiofor's role was confirmed during the 2015 D23 Expo.[19] In April, Derrickson and members of the production team visited New York City to scout potential filming locations, while Feige revealed that filming would begin that November.[118] A month later, Tilda Swinton was in talks to play the Ancient One.[119] In June 2015, Derrickson announced that he was going to London to begin work on the film,[120] and Feige confirmed that Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum would appear, located on Bleecker Street in New York City's Greenwich Village, as in the comics.[50] Swinton confirmed her role in the film in July,[121] when Rachel McAdams was being considered for the female lead. McAdams cautioned that \"it's still super-early, and I don't know where that's gonna go, if it's gonna go anywhere at all\",[122] but she ultimately confirmed her role during the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.[24] Jessica Chastain had been approached for the role before McAdams, but turned down the opportunity because she felt she was \"only going to get one shot at being in a Marvel film\" and wanted to be a lead character.[123] Mads Mikkelsen entered into early negotiations to play a villain in August,[124] \"one of a number of actors being considered for the unspecified villainous role.\"[125]\n\nIn September 2015, Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn stated that many of the crew that worked on that film were unable to return for its sequel, because they had committed to Doctor Strange.[126] Derrickson also revealed that Gunn had provided notes on the script, beyond the general conversing the MCU directors have between themselves for their films.[127] At the end of the month, Feige stated that additional casting announcements would be made \"before the end of the year\",[128] and by early November, Michael Stuhlbarg entered negotiations to appear in the film as Nicodemus West, a rival of Strange.[35] Derrickson had offered the role to Stuhlbarg because he was interested in working with the actor, and he agreed to join the cast after reading some Doctor Strange comics and being drawn to the character's \"guilt-ridden arc\" where West \"blames himself for ruining the surgery on Strange's hands and robbing him of his ability to operate\".[129]\n\nFeige felt that the visuals of the film needed \"to be a Ditko/Kubrick/Miyazaki/The Matrix mind-trip\",[130] and said that \"You don't get into it in Harry Potter, but if a scientist went to Hogwarts he'd find out how some of that stuff is happening! We're not going to spend a lot of time on that, but there will be some of that. And particularly for a character like Strange, who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds.\"[130] In developing the film's magic, Derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat the representation of magic from previous films, like Fantasia and Harry Potter, wanting \"to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal. And to root it in gestures as opposed to spoken incantations and things like that.\"[96] Feige called Doctor Strange the \"doorway\" into the supernatural side of the MCU,[131] a role that Derrickson noted was also served by the character in the early comics, when the Doctor Strange comics \"broke open the Marvel comic book universe into the Marvel multiverse\".[132] Discussing the portrayal of other dimensions in the film, Feige stated that it would not explore parallel realities like the comics' \"Earth-616 and Earth-617\", but would instead feature \"dimensions that are so mind-bending that you can barely perceive them\",[133] like the Astral plane, Dark Dimension, and Mirror Dimension.[134][135][136]\n\nAstrophysicist Adam Frank served as a scientific consultant on the film, having already known Derrickson and been a Marvel fan since childhood.[137] Frank advised on \"the human experience of space and time\", helping Marvel conceive ideas for their cinematic multiverse, and suggesting dialogue for characters based on their beliefs, whether they were materialist, rationalist, reductionist, or \"had this enlarged perspective.\"[138] He noted that modern movie goers may not necessarily understand these complex scientific ideas, but do appear to appreciate that \"amazing things happen from science. So by grounding your stories enough in science to not so much make them plausible, but to allow that science to open up new possibilities—people are used to that in their lives. So I think it makes sense to them, and it's exciting to them\". This was an aspect of previous MCU films that Frank called a \"great thing ... speaking as a scientist\", saying that \"they build a coherent and consistent universe that respects the scientific process and that uses enough of real science to make things plausible or build off them.\"[137]\n\nPrincipal photography began in Nepal on November 4, 2015, under the working title Checkmate.[139][140] Ben Davis, serving as cinematographer for the film after doing the same on Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers: Age of Ultron, described Doctor Strange as Marvel's Fantasia, and noted that a lot of previsualization was required to figure out how to shoot the \"psychedelic\", M. C. Escher-inspired imagery.[141] Davis used the Arri Alexa 65 camera for the film,[142] along with the Arri Alexa XT Plus. Vision Research Phantom Flex 4Ks, which shoot up to 1000 fps, were used for high-speed sequences like Strange's car crash.[143]\n\nDerrickson chose Nepal as a location to feature an \"Eastern city\" that would not be familiar to most audiences. After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event \"was all the more reason to shoot there\".[144] Cargill said that the location of Kamar-Taj was shifted from Tibet to Nepal to prevent censorship by the Chinese government.[145][146] Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was \"absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it's so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It's important to a film like this—which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension—that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous.\"[147] The eventual filming locations around the Kathmandu Valley included the Pashupatinath and Swayambhunath Temples;[148] Thamel and New Road in Kathmandu;[149] and the Patan Durbar Square in Patan.[150][151]\n\nProduction moved to Longcross Studios in Surrey, England on November 11,[152] and was scheduled to stay there until March 2016.[153] The real Kathmandu street that led into the fictional Kamar-Taj courtyard was replicated at Longcross, which production designer Charles Wood described as \"very hard because Kathmandu is a most beautiful city and it's steeped in history. To transition from that level of detail and history, with the shape of the streets, the warping of the buildings, these ancient bricks and these ancient tiles, was a real challenge.\" For authenticity, the set was dressed with real food, and populated with dogs, pigeons, and Nepalese extras, many of whom were relatives of people who live on the real Kathmandu street.[147] The inside of Kamar-Taj was also constructed at Longcross, with \"sculptors creating beautiful columns and wall decorations and craftsmen building screens and doors to evoke the exotic feel of the ancient sanctuary.\" Wood's goal was to make the set feel like the Ancient One and her disciples actually lived there, and give it a \"truly spiritual, truly magical\" feel, while integrating it into a real building that the production filmed in Kathmandu. This and the Kathmandu street were two of twenty-one sets that the crew built at Longcross. Others included Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum, and a Hong Kong street \"complete with over 80 neon signs and a giant roof to keep the rain out.\"[147] Citypoint on Ropemaker Street, London, doubled as the New York City building where the Ancient One falls to her death.[154]\n\nFilming also took place in Hong Kong,[2][155] and in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood.[139] Additional New York City-set scenes were shot at Shepperton Studios,[106][156] and later in London.[157] By the end of November, the casting of Mikkelsen and Stuhlbarg was confirmed,[2] alongside Amy Landecker and Scott Adkins in unspecified roles.[39][158] Additionally, Benedict Wong heard about the film from his friend Ejiofor, and sought a role in it himself.[159] He was cast as Wong in January,[30] and immediately joined the production for filming.[159] Lamborghini provided six Huracán LP 610-4s for use in the film, one of which the production wrecked during filming.[143][160] Lamborghini said that they felt \"there are a lot of characteristics of Doctor Strange that are connected with the Lamborghini philosophy.\"[160] The Lamborghini crash scene was filmed at Northfleet, Kent by the River Thames.[161] Also in January 2016, filming took place at Exeter College, Oxford.[140][155] The next month, Feige revealed that the film originally had a prologue that took place in CERN, due to the real world research being done at the facility on alternate dimensions and parallel universes.[32] Production moved to New York City's Flatiron District in April,[156] where set photos revealed that Zara Phythian had joined the cast.[59] Principal photography wrapped in New York City on April 3, 2016.[162]\n\nIn June 2016, a Diamond Select Toys press release for Doctor Strange toys, in their Marvel Minimates line, named Mikkelsen's character Kaecilius and McAdams' character Christine Palmer.[41] Mikkelsen's role was confirmed in an official tie-in comic for the film,[31] while McAdams' was confirmed at San Diego Comic-Con in 2016.[25] Additionally, Benjamin Bratt was revealed to have been cast[36] as Jonathan Pangborn;[37] Adkins' role was revealed to be Lucian, a follower of Kaecilius;[58] and Landecker's role was later revealed to be anesthesiologist Dr. Bruner.[58] The latter was mostly cut from the film,[58][63] with Landecker explaining that she had been cast in the small role, for two scenes at the beginning of the film, because Derrickson was a fan of her performance in A Serious Man, which also starred Stuhlbarg. After filming her first scene, in which she assists Strange with a surgery, Landecker asked not to be involved in the other scene because she had no lines for it and was only seen from behind, and instead wished to attend a special premiere at the White House for her series Transparent. The actress believed she was later cut from the first scene, but she is still credited for a brief appearance.[63] Also, Derrickson revealed that Lulu Wilson had been cast as Strange's sister, for a scene depicting her drowning at a young age. The scene had been shot, and Derrickson thought it was \"great [as a] self-contained scene\", but it \"didn't work\" with the rest of the film, and was cut.[94]\n\nAlso at San Diego Comic-Con, Derrickson noted that there were still \"a couple pickup shoots\" to do for the film to \"clarify the logic\".[163] Further content for the film's training sequence was also shot during these reshoots, as early test audiences \"loved [the training portion of the film] and wanted more\".[144] Wong indicated that the reshoots had been completed in August.[164] Dan Harmon wrote material for these additional scenes,[165] which Derrickson described as \"script analysis and dialogue work\", not enough to receive credit in the film.[166] Feige said that in addition to any humor that Harmon could add to the film, he was brought on to \"give us his opinions on the sci-fi concepts.\"[167] Before the film's sets were demolished, Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi took advantage by writing and filming a scene featuring Strange meeting Chris Hemsworth's Thor. The scene was for Ragnarok and shot before that film began production. Derrickson and Marvel felt the scene was \"kind of perfect\" to show Strange joining the wider MCU after his stand alone introduction, and so added it to Doctor Strange as a mid-credits scene.[55][168] A post-credits scene, directed by Derrickson, teases Mordo's role as an antagonist to Strange in a potential Doctor Strange sequel.[169]\n\nStan Lee's cameo in the film was directed by Gunn on the set of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. This was alongside several other Lee cameos, to limit the amount of travel he had to do for the next four MCU films. Gunn contacted Derrickson during the shoot to ensure that the shot matched up with the respective Doctor Strange scene, and \"kept throwing lines at\" Lee on the day to give Derrickson and Marvel plenty of options to choose from for the film.[170] Additional options Gunn filmed included Lee reading a book and asking a gentleman next to him if he knew what the word excelsior meant; Lee laughing really hard and stating he was laughing for no reason, being \"totally crazy\"; and Lee laughing hysterically at a Garfield book, noting how the character \"HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!\". Gunn felt the Garfield option was originally meant to appear in the final version of the film, but ended up being too long for the scene.[171] By October 10, 2016, Derrickson had completed the film.[62]\n\nFeige described the film's use of 3D as serving the storytelling, saying, \"hopefully it helps bend people's minds even more than with just the flat screen.\"[172] He said that \"there are sequences of the film that 3D is actually necessary to tell the dimensional story that is happening through visuals\". However, he noted that during visual effects reviews for the film it became apparent that these sequences were adversely affecting the story when viewed in 2D, which necessitated adjustments so the sequences would work in all formats.[173] Over one hour of footage in the film was \"specially formatted\" for IMAX.[174]\n\nVisual effects for Doctor Strange were provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Method Studios, Framestore, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Rise FX, Crafty Apes, and SPOV,[143][175] contributing to 1450 effects shots. Previsualization was handled by The Third Floor. All vendors worked on the common magical elements (mandalas, magical runes shields, whips, stalks and aerial 'lily pads', and portals).[143] Visual effects supervisor Stephane Ceretti, who also worked on Guardians of the Galaxy, explained the similarities and differences between the two films, saying, \"there's some resemblance in some of the things that we've done. In the same way, it's a totally different world. In [Guardians], it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy kind of take on things as well. This one is a little bit more serious. It's also a little bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. Guardians was also for us a huge animation film. This one was less of it. This one was more about the environments and effects\".[176]\n\nFurther discussing the film's visuals, Derrickson described influences as \"the Steve Ditko, Stan Lee comics [which] were all about these weird visuals\",[163] as well as \"a fair amount of surrealist art and photography and M. C. Escher\".[177] Additional inspiration for the film's visuals came from \"a bunch of experimental, fractal videos from YouTube\" that Derrickson found, and the mobile video game Monument Valley.[178] Derrickson's \"ambition was to use cutting-edge visual effects to do things that are fresh and new—to not just blow things up.\"[177] Feige explained that one of the more difficult areas to be inventive was the action sequences, as Derrickson did not want them \"to simply be: someone shoots a bolt of lightning, and someone blocks a ball of lightning, so someone throws another bolt of lightning...\" Instead, they tried to incorporate the use of different dimensions into the action \"in the interest of creating a visual tapestry that is totally different in terms of an action scene we've seen in any other movies.\"[133] On the film's set pieces, Derrickson reiterated that the film's astral fight scene was based on The Oath comic, while adding that the end fight was \"an attempt to capture the quality of that artwork\" from the original comics, and the mirror dimension chase was an attempt to take Inception \"to the Nth degree and take it way more surreal and way farther. But I certainly owe something to that movie.\"[96] Specifically for the climax of the film, Derrickson wanted to play on the superhero trope of \"a big fight scene where they're tearing up a city, and there's a portal opening up and they have to close it\", subverting it by having the villain defeated with an intelligent use of power rather than showing \"which CGI thing can hit the other CGI thing harder\".[168]\n\nILM worked on the folding Manhattan mirror sequence (chosen because of their work creating a digital New York in The Avengers) and the time fight sequence in Hong Kong, which consisted of 200 and 150 shots, respectively. They began work on the film 10 months before filming began to plan out the Manhattan sequence; it was mainly CGI, though some New York location shots were used. The sequence was mainly handled by ILM's San Francisco and Vancouver offices. The Hong Kong time sequence was done mainly by ILM's London office. ILM also created digital doubles for many of the actors, which were shared with the other vendors. Method Studios, who worked on the Quantum Realm in Ant-Man, worked on the \"magical mystery tour\" sequence, with Strange hurtling through various dimensions. The sequence was handled by Method's Los Angeles studio, with their Vancouver studio contributing the opening shot of the sequence. The only shot Method did not work on in the sequence was the one that linked to Dormammu, as Luma Pictures assisted in his creation (they handled his other appearances in the film). Method created 7 dimensions for the sequence: the initial wormhole to the \"Speaker Cone\"; the Bioluminesce world; the fractals of \"soft solid\" world; a version of the Quantum Realm; Strange falling through his own eye and Cosmic Scream; the Dark Dimension; and the Shape Shifting realm. The Shape Shifting realm originally had Strange morphing and changing shape, but that was ultimately removed as Derrickson felt the audience needed to see Cumberbatch. Method's Vancouver studio created Strange's car crash, the rooftop training, and the sequence in which Strange experiments with time on an apple in the Kamar-Taj library. The car crash blended the high-speed photography and some green screen sequences, with digital assets for both Cumberbatch and the car. In total, Method worked on 270 effects shots.[143]\n\nFramestore was chosen to work on the Cloak of Levitation, due to their work creating Rocket in Guardians of the Galaxy. Ceretti called Cloak's actions \"kind of scripted but not as deeply\" as the result, and said that during the pre-visualization process \"we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film\".[176] Framestore also worked on environment shots, the Mandelbrot set sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form \"one of the hardest effects we've had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful.\" Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a geode. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence at the beginning of the film.[143]\n\nIn creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as \"it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [When he is talking to Strange] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff... these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [a] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [look] of the entire space.\" On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, \"We tried to make it alive all the time—the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment,\" with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit \"with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [with] colors, crazy blacklight colors.\" He continued, \"It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [that] we really tried to be faithful to.\"[179]\n\nIn May 2016, Michael Giacchino revealed that he would score the film.[180] Derrickson called the score \"magic in the literal sense of the word,\" adding Giacchino \"is doing what good scorers do, which is he is not just creating music that supports the images, he's adding a third thing to the movie. It becomes something new with his music in there that it didn't have with temp music.\"[163] The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios.[181] During a recording session, Paul McCartney heard one of Giacchino's cues being recorded and likened it to the Beatles song \"I Am the Walrus\".[182] Derrickson, a Bob Dylan fan, looked for a place in the film to include one of his songs, but could not find one. However, he was able to include the song \"Interstellar Overdrive\" by Pink Floyd.[183][184] Derrickson had hoped to use either \"Interstellar Overdrive\" or The Jimi Hendrix Experience's \"Are You Experienced?\" for the film's credits, but the royalties to use either in the credits were too expensive, resulting in Giacchino creating the track \"The Master of the Mystic End Credits\".[22] A soundtrack album from Hollywood Records was released digitally on October 21, 2016, with a physical release on November 18, 2016.[185][186]\n\nIn August 2015, a concept art trailer narrated by Derrickson was shown at the D23 Expo. The images showed artwork of Cumberbatch in a traditional Doctor Strange outfit from the comics, as well as a rough sequence of the plot, highlighting points such as Strange's car crash, his journey for healing, and fighting Ejiofor as Mordo (before the character was moved away from a villainous role in the film per discussions between Derrickson and the actor).[20][187] The trailer was met with \"a very big reaction from the gathered crowd.\"[187]\n\nOn April 12, 2016, the first teaser trailer for the film debuted on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.[188][189] Clark Collis of Entertainment Weekly compared the \"series of kaleidoscopic, world-bending scenes\" featured in the trailer to the film Inception,[189] as did Scott Mendelson of Forbes. Forbes added that the structure of the trailer resembled early marketing for the film Batman Begins.[190] The Hollywood Reporter's Graeme McMillian criticized these similarities, as well as similarities to The Matrix and between Cumberbatch's American accent and that of Hugh Laurie's Gregory House from House, calling them not \"necessarily a real problem, of course ... [but] there's nothing there outside the derivative aspects: due to the nature of the trailer, there's no story beyond the 'white man finds enlightenment in Asia' trope and barely any dialogue to let audiences decide that maybe the performances will elevate the material.\" McMillian did enjoy the visual effects and the visual of \"Tilda Swinton literally knock[ing] Benedict Cumberbatch's soul out of his body,\" but concluded, \"as an introduction to not only a brand new franchise for Marvel, but a potential new genre, this feels far less bold and assured\" than the first trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy.[191]\n\nIn July 2016, Marvel Comics released a prelude tie-in comic written by Will Corona Pilgrim, with art by Jorge Fornés.[192] The issue sees four Masters of the Mystic Arts–Kaecilius, Wong, Tina Minoru and Daniel Drumm–pursue a woman who has stolen a mystical relic.[31] A second issue, centered on the Ancient One training apprentices in the magical arts at Kamar-Taj, was released a month later.[193] Derrickson, Cumberbatch, Swinton, Ejiofor, McAdams, Mikkelsen, and Wong attended San Diego Comic-Con 2016, where they debuted an exclusive clip and the second trailer for the film.[194] The next month, the same Comic-Con clip was screened at the Asia Pop Comic Convention Manila.[195] In September 2016, an additional prelude comic was released, centered on Kaecilius,[196] while behind the scenes footage was released as a special feature on the Captain America: Civil War Blu-ray.[197] Also in September, Marvel, in partnership with Dolby Laboratories, Broadcom, Synchrony Bank, and Society for Science & the Public, announced \"The Magic of STEM Challenge\", aimed at females aged 15 through 18 in STEM fields. The challenge was for contestants to submit videos of them finding mentors to explore ideas once thought to only be possible with magic. Five winners would attend the world premiere of the film, and receive a tour of Walt Disney Studios, as well as a $1,000 saving account from Synchrony Bank, with one grand prize winner receiving a mentorship with Walt Disney Studio's Digital Team.[198]\n\nOn October 10, 2016, approximately 15 minutes of footage was screened at 115 IMAX 3D locations in North America, and select 3D and IMAX 3D locations worldwide. Fans attending the event received an exclusive IMAX poster for the film.[174] Umberto Gonzales of TheWrap called the footage \"stunning to behold\". He added that a sequence shown in which the Ancient One sends Strange \"on his first trippy tour through the multiverse\" was \"where the IMAX 3D really shines. The audience is given an incredible visual tour of the multiverse which features other dimensions and other realities. It really is something to behold in IMAX 3D,\" concluding that \"after being shown only 15 minutes of incredible preview footage, IMAX 3D is the definitive format to see the film.\"[199] Britt Hayes for ScreenCrush felt the footage was \"dizzying\" and \"far weirder and wilder than [the] trailers are letting on,\" though felt it was a bit difficult \"to judge some of what was shown out of context (especially earlier scenes)\". Regarding the same sequence where the Ancient One sends Strange through the multiverse, Hayes said, \"Seth Rogen's comedic drug trip sequences have nothing on the psychedelic visuals employed here. It's astounding, elaborate stuff, and easily provides the most entertaining moments in the footage.\"[200] IGN's Terri Schwartz said the sequences shown were where \"Derrickson's horror aesthetics shine through\".[136]\n\nMarvel provided Twitter stickers, Giphy content, Facebook Live, Snapchat lenses and filter, Tumblr stunts, and Instagram special content related to the film. Additionally, Microsoft Surface had a promotional sponsorship of the film, due to the use of the device in the filmmaking process. A partnership with Google's Tilt Brush app featured a \"Mixed Reality\" \"stunt with artists across Los Angeles, London, and Hong Kong, inspired by different dimensions in Doctor Strange and recreating the worlds in VR for an immersive visual experience.[201]\n\nDoctor Strange held its world premiere in Hong Kong on October 13, 2016,[48] and had its premiere in Hollywood, Los Angeles, at the TCL Chinese Theatre and El Capitan Theatre on October 20, 2016.[202][203] The film was released in the United Kingdom on October 25, 2016,[204] alongside a total of 33 markets in its first weekend, with 213 IMAX screens in 32 of those markets.[205] It was screened at the EW PopFest on October 28, 2016, in Los Angeles.[206] Doctor Strange's North America release on November 4 took place in 3,882 venues, of which 3,530 were in 3D, along with 379 IMAX theaters, 516 premium large-format (Disney's biggest release in that format to date), and 189 D-Box locations.[207] Overall, Doctor Strange had the widest IMAX release ever globally, along with being the first film to release on more than 1,000 IMAX screens.[205] It was previously reported to have been scheduled for a July 8, 2016, release,[105][208] before the production schedule shifted to accommodate Cumberbatch's other commitments.[47][114] Doctor Strange is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[209]\n\nDoctor Strange was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on February 14, 2017, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D and DVD on February 28, 2017. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes; audio commentary; deleted scenes; a blooper reel; an exclusive preview of the Phase Three films Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther, and Avengers: Infinity War; and Team Thor: Part 2, a continuation of the \"mockumentary\" short film Team Thor, that was directed by Waititi. Best Buy released an exclusive collector's edition SteelBook case for the regular and 3D Blu-ray release, featuring art based on the Book of Cagliostro and the Eye of Agamotto. Target's Blu-ray versions have an additional exclusive featurette, while the digital version also features an exclusive featurette.[210] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[211]\n\nDoctor Strange grossed $232.6 million in the United States and Canada and $445.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $677.8 million.[6] The film became the biggest IMAX opening in November domestically ($12.2 million), internationally ($24 million), and globally ($24.2 million), overtaking Interstellar's records.[212] By November 27, 2016, the film had become the biggest single-character introduction film in the MCU.[213] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $122.65 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it 11th on their list of 2016's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[214]\n\nDoctor Strange earned $32.6 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada, including Thursday previews, with a total weekend gross of $85.1 million; IMAX contributed $12.2 million to the opening weekend gross, with 3D contributing $24 million. The film was the number one film for the weekend, and became the second largest opening in November for Disney.[201] Initial projections for the film in late August 2016 had it earning as low as $50 million to as high as $88 million in its opening weekend,[215][216][217] with projections revised to $65–75 million closer to the film's release.[207] Doctor Strange remained the top film in its second weekend,[218] and fell to second in its third, behind Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.[219] In its fourth weekend, Doctor Strange was the third highest-grossing film, behind Fantastic Beasts and Moana.[220] It fell to fifth in its fifth and sixth weekends,[221][222] and by its seventh weekend had fallen to the ninth-highest-grossing place.[223] It was projected to earn $255 million for its total domestic gross.[216]\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, Doctor Strange earned $87.7 million in its first weekend from 33 markets, becoming the top film in all markets except Lithuania and Finland. South Korea was the top market overall with $18.1 million, locally the biggest opening weekend ever for an original Marvel release, along with an all-time best opening for an IMAX film. IMAX garnered a record $7.8 million, the best international IMAX debut for a film in the month of October, with Russia seeing its biggest Saturday IMAX gross for a Marvel film. Additionally, Hong Kong ($3.2 million), Thailand ($2.5 million), Malaysia ($2.4 million), and Singapore ($2.2 million) also had the biggest opening weekend ever for an original Marvel film.[205] In its second weekend, the film opened in 22 additional markets, becoming the top film in China with $44.4 million, the highest 3-day opening weekend for a first installment superhero film there. China's opening was also the third highest for an MCU film, behind Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War, as well as the best 3-day opening for an IMAX film in November with $6.3 million. IMAX also set November opening records in India, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador. Brazil was also a top market, earning $7.9 million.[212]\n\nDoctor Strange remained the number one film in its third weekend for the third consecutive week in Denmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Singapore, and number one for the second week in China and Russia. It also became the highest-grossing original MCU release in India, Hong Kong, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.[224] Its fourth weekend saw China's total gross surpass $100 million, \"an increasingly rare feat in 2016.\"[225] The next weekend, Doctor Strange opened in Argentina, where it was the number one film and earned $1 million.[213] The film's fourteenth weekend saw it open in Japan, where it was number one with $4.5 million.[226] As of December 4, 2016[update], the film's largest markets were China ($110.3 million), South Korea ($41.3 million), and the United Kingdom and Ireland ($27.9 million).[227]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 89%, with an average score of 7.3/10, based on 389 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Doctor Strange artfully balances its outré source material against the blockbuster constraints of the MCU, delivering a thoroughly entertaining superhero origin story in the bargain.\"[228] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 72 out of 100, based on reviews from 49 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[229] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 91% overall positive score and a 73% \"definite recommend\".[201]\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy called Doctor Strange \"an engaging, smartly cast and sporadically eye-popping addition\" to the franchise, adding \"this action movie ostensibly rooted in the mind-expanding tenets of Eastern mysticism is different enough to establish a solid niche alongside the blockbuster combine's established money machines.\" McCarthy, in addition to praising the acting, felt that there were certain sequences that \"go far beyond [Inception] in visual spectacle\" and that the time manipulation sequences, \"seen to outstanding advantage in 3D, [were what] mind-trip-seeking audiences back in Doctor Strange's origin days would have called 'far-out' but today's fans will simply deem 'amazing'.\"[230] Peter Debruge of Variety called the film \"Marvel's most satisfying entry since Spider-Man 2,\" and wrote that despite having \"the same look, feel, and fancy corporate sheen\" as the other MCU films, it \"boasts an underlying originality and freshness missing from the increasingly cookie-cutter comic-book realm of late.\" Debruge also praised the casting along with the multitude of visual effects the film was able to achieve.[38]\n\nAlonso Duralde, reviewing for TheWrap said, \"True, Doctor Strange is an origin story, and occasionally hemmed in by the genre's narrative requirements, but it's smart enough to bring in great British actors to make the predictable paces and life lessons feel fresh and fascinating.\" Regarding the film's visuals, Duralde praised them, exclaiming, \"In a year where bloated, empty spectacles have induced a crushing level of CG fatigue, this funny, freaky adventure reminds us of how effective VFX can be when they've got some imagination behind them.\"[231] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, \"The giddily enjoyable Doctor Strange ... is part of Marvel's strategy for world domination, yet it's also so visually transfixing, so beautiful and nimble that you may even briefly forget the brand.\"[232] Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times said, \"Within the familiar narrative contours of the origin story, writer-director Scott Derrickson crams in enough out-of-body experiences, spatial-temporal shenanigans and dazzlingly kaleidoscopic visuals to make you wonder if he and his co-writers ... were dropping acid behind the scenes.\"[233]\n\nConversely, Angelica Jade Bastién, writing for RogerEbert.com, said, \"For all of its wondrous world-building and trippy effects, Doctor Strange isn't the evolutionary step forward for Marvel that it needs to be storytelling-wise. Underneath all of its improvements, the core narrative is something we've seen countless times.\"[234] Mara Reinstein of US Weekly called the film \"joyless\" and wrote, \"Despite [Benedict Cumberbatch's] alluring powers, he can't save an overly convoluted film that relies on a galaxy of derivative 3-D special-effect tricks... Nobody is having much fun here – save for the doctor's Cloak of Levitation that has its own devilish personality and can whisk him out of scary situations.\"[235] Rex Reed of The New York Observer called Doctor Strange \"an awkwardly cliché-riddled mix of hamstrung imagination and bizarro reality\" and said, \"None of it makes any sense... For characterization, dialogue, narrative arc, acceptable acting and coherence, go elsewhere.\"[236] Adam Graham of The Detroit News said, \"Cumberbatch is wildly charismatic in the lead role... But that's the thing: He's a better party guest than he is a host. Doctor Strange is a fine introduction, but by the end, you're not sad to be headed for the door.\"[237]\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was released on May 6, 2022.[264] Sam Raimi replaced Derrickson as director,[265] with a script written by Michael Waldron.[266] Cumberbatch, Wong, Ejiofor, and McAdams reprised their roles, with Elizabeth Olsen also reprising her role of Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch from other MCU media.[267]\n"

        "content": "\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a 2017 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team Guardians of the Galaxy, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and the 15th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by James Gunn, the film stars an ensemble cast featuring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldaña, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Sylvester Stallone, and Kurt Russell. In the film, the Guardians travel throughout the cosmos as they help Peter Quill (Pratt) learn more about his mysterious parentage.\n\nThe film was officially announced at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con before the theatrical release of the first film, along with Gunn's return as writer and director from the first film, with the title of the sequel revealed a year later in June 2015. Principal photography began in February 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with many crew changes from the first film due to other commitments. Filming concluded in June 2016. Gunn chose to set the sequel shortly after the first film to explore the characters' new roles as the Guardians, and to follow the storyline of Quill's father established throughout that previous film. Russell was confirmed as Quill's father in July 2016, portraying Ego, a departure from Quill's comic father.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 premiered in Tokyo on April 10, 2017, and was released in the United States on May 5, 2017, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. It grossed more than $869 million worldwide, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2017, while also outgrossing its predecessor. The film received praise for its visuals, direction, soundtrack, action sequences, humor, and performances, though some critics deemed it inferior to the original. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 90th Academy Awards. A sequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, was released on May 5, 2023, preceded by the Disney+ special The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special in November 2022.\n\nIn 2014, Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and Baby Groot are renowned as the Guardians of the Galaxy. High Priestess Ayesha of the Sovereign race has the Guardians protect valuable Anulax batteries from an Abilisk, an inter-dimensional monster, in exchange for Nebula, Gamora's estranged sister, who was caught attempting to steal the batteries. After Rocket steals the batteries for himself, the Sovereign attacks the Guardians' ship with a fleet of drones. A mysterious figure destroys the drones and the Guardians crash-land on nearby planet Berhert. The figure reveals himself as Ego, Quill's father, and he introduces Mantis, his naïve empath servant. Ego invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to his home planet, while Rocket and Groot remain behind to repair the ship and watch Nebula.\n\nAyesha hires Yondu Udonta and his crew, who have been exiled from the greater Ravager community by Ravager leader Stakar Ogord for child trafficking, to recapture the Guardians. They capture Rocket, but when Yondu hesitates to turn over Quill, whom he raised, his lieutenant Kraglin Obfonteri questions his objectivity, and Taserface, another lieutenant, leads a mutiny, aided by Nebula, who shoots Yondu. Taserface executes Yondu's loyalists, and imprisons him and Rocket aboard Yondu's ship. Nebula leaves to find and kill Gamora, whom she blames for the torture inflicted on her by Thanos, their adoptive father. Kraglin, who is remorseful and never signed up for a mutiny, helps Groot free Rocket and Yondu, and while escaping, the group set the ship to self-destruct using Yondu's arrow. Taserface informs the Sovereign before being killed by the explosion.\n\nEgo, a god-like Celestial that manipulated the matter around his consciousness to form his \"home\" planet, explains that he projected a humanoid guise to travel the universe and discover a purpose, eventually falling in love with Quill's mother Meredith. Ego hired Yondu to collect the young Quill after Meredith's death, but the boy was never delivered, and Ego has been searching for him ever since. He teaches Quill to manipulate his inherited Celestial power, while Mantis grows close to Drax and tries to warn him of Ego's plans. Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and tries to kill Gamora, but the pair reconcile and reach an uneasy alliance, soon discovering a cavern filled with skeletal remains. Ego brainwashes Quill and reveals that in his travels, he planted seedlings on thousands of worlds that can terraform into new extensions of himself, but only the power of two Celestials can activate them. He adds that he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu to collect their offspring but killed them all when they failed to inherit his Celestial power. When Ego admits that he gave Meredith the brain tumor that killed her, an infuriated Quill breaks out of his brainwashing and violently attacks him. Ego then parasitically draws Quill's energy to activate the seedlings, which begin to consume the worlds on which they are planted.\n\nRocket, Yondu, Groot, and Kraglin arrive, and together with Mantis, Drax, Nebula and Gamora, they rescue Quill. The reunited Guardians travel to Ego's brain at the planet's core, where Yondu reveals that he kept Quill to spare him from Ego. As the Sovereign's drones return and attack, Rocket makes a bomb using the stolen batteries, which Groot plants on Ego's brain. Quill uses his newfound Celestial powers to fight Ego, distracting him long enough for the other Guardians and Mantis to escape. The bomb explodes, killing Ego and disintegrating the planet, but also draining Quill of his Celestial powers. Yondu sacrifices himself to save Quill by letting himself die in the vacuum of space. Despite having reconciled with Gamora, Nebula chooses to leave and resume her quest to kill Thanos. The Guardians, with Mantis as a new member, hold a funeral for Yondu as dozens of Ravager ships arrive, having heard of Yondu's sacrifice and accept him as a Ravager again.\n\nIn a series of mid-and post-credit scenes, Kraglin takes up Yondu's telekinetic arrow and control-fin; Ogord reunites with his ex-teammates and fellow Ravager captains; Ayesha creates Adam, a new artificial being with whom she plans to destroy the Guardians;[a] and Groot grows into a teenager.[b]\n\nElizabeth Debicki appears as Ayesha, the golden High Priestess and the leader of the Sovereign people,[48][56][57] a genetically engineered race who are \"gold and perfect and wanting to be physically and mentally impeccable\". Gunn was \"very specific\" when writing the character, and after casting director Sarah Finn suggested Debicki, Gunn \"knew right away that she was the one\". Gunn highlighted the actress' beauty and 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) height. Debicki wore platform shoes to increase her height to 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m).[36] Chris Sullivan portrays Taserface, the leader of a mutinous group of the Ravagers.[48][57] Gunn originally posted a photo of the comic book character on his social media after landing Guardians of the Galaxy, calling him \"the dumbest character of all time\" and saying he would never feature the character in a film. After eventually deciding to use the character in the sequel, Gunn felt the character had given himself the name Taserface and is \"a real dumbass\".[58] Sullivan's makeup took two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half hours to apply each day.[59] Sean Gunn appears as Kraglin Obfonteri, Yondu's second-in-command in the Ravagers.[60] Kraglin has an expanded role compared to the previous film—Sean Gunn explained, \"In the first film he did a lot of just saying yes and being at Yondu's side, but in this movie things take a little bit of a different turn as Kraglin has a little bit of a crisis of conscience and has to decide whether he's going to stick with Yondu or join forces with the growing faction of mutineers.\"[36][61]\n\nAdditionally, reprising their roles from the first film are Laura Haddock as Meredith Quill, Gregg Henry as her father, Seth Green as the voice of Howard the Duck, and canine actor Fred as Cosmo.[55][62][63] Members of Yondu's Ravager crew appearing in the film include Evan Jones as Retch, Jimmy Urine as Half-Nut, Stephen Blackehart as Brahl,[57] Steve Agee as Gef,[57][64] Mike Escamilla as Scrote,[65] Joe Fria as Oblo, Terence Rosemore as Narblik,[57] and Tommy Flanagan as Tullk,[57][66][67] as well as Charred Walls of the Damned drummer and Howard Stern Show personality Richard Christy in a cameo appearance.[68] The other members of Stakar and Yondu's old team, based on the comic's original incarnation of the Guardians of the Galaxy, include Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex, Ving Rhames as Charlie-27, and Michelle Yeoh as Aleta Ogord.[47][63] Also included in the team are the CG characters Krugarr and Mainframe, with the latter voiced, in an uncredited cameo, by Miley Cyrus.[47][69] Rosenbaum had previously auditioned to play Peter Quill in Vol. 1.[70] Gunn cast Yeoh because of his love of 1990s Hong Kong films,[71] and Cyrus after admiring \"the tone of her voice\" while watching her as a coach on The Voice.[69] He added that the team would return in future MCU films alongside Stallone's Stakar.[47]\n\nStan Lee appears as an informant to the Watchers, discussing previous adventures that include his cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a FedEx delivery man, which connects to Lee's cameo as a FedEx delivery man in Captain America: Civil War (2016).[72] This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos,[73] with Gunn noting that \"people thought Stan Lee is a Watcher and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher. So, Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU.\"[72][73] Feige added that Lee \"clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films. So the notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in Guardians...really says, so wait a minute, he's this same character who's popped up in all these films?\"[74] Lee filmed several different versions of the scene, including an alternative where he references his role in Deadpool, which would have been the first acknowledgment of the X-Men film series by an MCU film.[73] Gunn later admitted that the Civil War reference is a continuity error, given Vol. 2 is set before the events of Civil War, saying, \"I screwed up; I wasn't thinking. But I'm going to say that probably Stan Lee used the guise of a FedEx guy more than one time.\"[72]\n\nDavid Hasselhoff makes a cameo appearance as himself, when Ego shape-shifts to his likeness,[13] while Rob Zombie once again has a Ravager voice cameo.[55][75] Footage of Jeff Goldblum dancing as the Grandmaster from the set of Thor: Ragnarok (2017) is used briefly during the end credits, with Feige explaining that Marvel \"thought it would be fun to put it in there\" especially since the comic version of Grandmaster is the brother of the Collector, who appeared in the first Guardians film.[76] Ben Browder, the star of the series Farscape, of which Gunn is an avid fan, cameos as a Sovereign Admiral.[77] Molly Quinn appears as Howard the Duck's date.[13] Jim Gunn Sr. and Leota Gunn, parents of James and Sean Gunn, also make cameo appearances in the film as an elderly couple on Earth.[78] Jimmy Kimmel Live!'s Guillermo Rodriguez has an uncredited cameo appearance as a police officer on Earth when the seedling was terraforming.[79][80]\n\n\"There are general ideas for what the sequel is and where it goes and who's involved and what happens and what we find out about our characters. So it's very general and that could change ... but I know a lot about who these characters are and where they came from and where they're going. I'm excited by the possibility of creating a sequel because we had to do a lot of setup in [the first] movie and with a sequel we don't have to do that setup which will make it so much easier for me.\"\n\nIn May 2014, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated he felt the first Guardians of the Galaxy film (2014) had \"strong franchise potential\".[82] He added that their goal was to create \"another Avengers (2012)\".[83] James Gunn, who directed and co-wrote the first film, said that he would like to return for a sequel, and that he was contractually obligated to if asked.[84] The next month, producer Kevin Feige said there are \"places we can take [the franchise] and we have ideas of where we'd like to go\" based on the wide array of characters, worlds and storylines from the comics.[85] In July 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy co-screenwriter Nicole Perlman confirmed a sequel, saying it was \"going to happen\" due to the positive internal response to the first film at Disney, and that Gunn would write and direct.[86][87] At San Diego Comic-Con soon after, the sequel was given a release date of July 28, 2017.[88]\n\nGunn had begun work on the film within a month, and said it would include at least one new Guardian from the comics.[89][90] In October, Gunn confirmed that all five original Guardians would return for the sequel, along with other supporting characters,[91] and the release date was moved up to May 5, 2017.[92] In the following months, Michael Rooker said he would return as Yondu Udonta, and was looking forward to exploring new areas of the character.[32][93] Chris Pratt, who played Peter Quill/Star-Lord in the first film, confirmed the sequel would be one of his next projects.[8] Bradley Cooper expressed interest and excitement when asked if he would return as Rocket.[94] Vin Diesel also confirmed he would return as Groot.[20] In March 2015, Gunn revealed that filming would take place in Atlanta, Georgia with \"major crew changes\" from the first film, and that his brother, Sean Gunn, would return as Kraglin Obfonteri alongside Karen Gillan as Nebula.[60][95] He explained his relationship with Marvel Studios, saying the company \"let me go and do my thing, and I truly listen to their notes and ideas. I've never been told to put in any character or plot element at all... When they trust you they give you a wide berth... we just fit\".[95]\n\nIn May, Gunn said the sequel would feature fewer characters than the first film, and that he had planned to introduce two major new characters in the script—Mantis and Adam Warlock.[5][9] Talks had begun with an actor Gunn had in mind to portray Mantis,[96] while he had decided to remove Warlock due to the film \"getting too busy\", explaining, \"one of the main things with Guardians of the Galaxy is not to add a bunch of characters, not to make it bigger in that way but to go deeper with the characters... and getting to know them more emotionally... everything is just getting too sprawling and too crazy for me in these superhero comic book movies\".[9] Gunn added, \"I adored what we had done with him. I think we did something really creative and unique with Adam Warlock. But it was one character too many and I didn't want to lose Mantis and Mantis was more organically part of the movie anyway\".[5] He noted that Warlock could appear in future Guardians films, and is considered \"a pretty important part\" of the cosmic side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[5][97] The character's future introduction is hinted at in one of the film's mid-credits scenes.[4] Gunn noted that Marvel gave him \"some blowback\" for including the Warlock teaser because they felt fans would believe the character would be appearing in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), which was not the case. By including the scene, Gunn promised Marvel he would use his social media presence to clarify for fans that the character would not be seen in either of the Avengers films.[98]\n\nAfter the film's announcement, Gunn said he knew \"a lot of where I want to go [in the sequel]\",[99] having written the backstory of Peter Quill, his father and his history with Yondu during the making of the first film with the intention of exploring them in a future film.[21] Gunn's earliest idea for a Guardians sequel involved Rocket and Groot starring as the main characters in a story fleshing out the former's origin story, but Gunn felt that he had to flesh out Peter Quill's origins first.[100] Gunn wanted to give the sequel a different structure from the first film, since \"one of the reasons people like Guardians is because it's fresh and different, so the second one will be fresh and different from the first one\".[101] Before starting on the script, Gunn hoped to further explore Drax, Nebula, Kraglin and the Collector and expand on Xandarian, Kree, Krylorian and Ravager culture.[99][102] He also hoped to introduce more female characters in the sequel, though wanted to avoid including \"earthlings\" such as Carol Danvers,[103] as well as Novas Richard Rider or Sam Alexander, saying, \"I think Quill being the only earthling is important. That serves the entire movie-going audience and not just the handful of Nova [and Carol Danvers] fans\".[104] The character Darkhawk had also been considered for the film.[105]\n\nFeige said exploring Quill's father \"would certainly be part of a next Guardians adventure\", adding \"I think there's a reason we seeded it at the very end of the [first] film like that\".[106] Gunn also stated that he wanted to make sure \"Yondu's place in everything made sense\" in regards to his relationship to Quill and his father, and also revealed Quill's father would not be J'son as in the comics.[51] Gunn \"was less confident [Marvel] was going to buy in on Baby Groot than\" including Ego, since \"adult Groot was the most popular character from the first film and I didn't think they'd want to risk a good thing\". However, by changing Groot, Gunn felt it \"opened the film up\" creatively, allowing Gunn to bring out \"new aspects of our other characters\".[107] Gunn said Thanos would only appear in the sequel \"if he helps our story and he will not show up at all if not. Thanos is not the most important thing in Guardians 2, that's for damn sure. There's the Guardians themselves and other threats the Guardians are going to be facing that are not Thanos\".[51] Feige later confirmed that Thanos would not appear in the sequel, as he was being saved for a \"grander\" return.[108][109] When asked about how the film would connect with the other Phase Three films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Gunn said, \"I don't feel beholden to that stuff at all. I think it's really about the Guardians and what they are doing\".[110]\n\nGunn set the film two to three months after the first film[97][111] \"because he felt the group are just such fragile egos and he didn't think this story could start years later\".[97] Major planets visited in the film include Sovereign, Berhart and Contraxia. Feige also stated two or three other worlds would be seen, as well as \"a little bit of Earth in this film, but it's not these characters going to Earth\".[15] In December 2014, Gunn revealed the story for the film was written, saying, \"It's [still] constantly shifting, but I feel like it's pretty strong. I'm excited about it\".[112] By early February 2015, Gunn was \"a few short weeks\" away from submitting a full story treatment to Marvel, and said that when he first presented his idea for the sequel to the company they thought it was \"risky\". He described it as \"not really based on anything\" from the comics, being mainly an original story.[113][114] Gunn later referred to the full treatment as a \"scriptment\", \"a 70-page combination of a script and a treatment and it goes through every beat of the movie\".[9] By April, he was preparing to write the screenplay,[113] and in May he was hoping to complete the script before he began work on The Belko Experiment (2016) in June 2015.[96]\n\nAs he developed the story, Gunn considered to have Gamora killed off due to Zoe Saldaña's original expectations to only play the role in the first film.[115] As he knew that Saldaña did not wish to play Gamora for a few years, Gunn considered to have Gamora sacrifice herself at the end of the film to save Peter so he could learn about himself, but Feige and Louis D'Esposito talked Gunn out from taking that decision because it did not work well with the story, in addition to their plans to have Gamora die in Infinity War instead as the Russo brothers informed Gunn during months of planning Vol. 2.[116] After discussing it with Marvel and realizing that it would be better for Gamora to die in the third Avengers film,[117] Gunn ultimately concluded that the story naturally progressed in a way that insisted that Yondu Udonta should be the one to die at the end to rescue Quill despite Gunn's initial reluctance in killing off Michael Rooker's character due to their friendship, but in retrospective, Gunn felt that the story worked out in a perfect way to set up Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023).[116]\n\nOn June 2, 2015, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed the first draft of the screenplay, and that the film's title would not simply be Guardians of the Galaxy 2.[118] The same week, he confirmed the return of Saldaña, Dave Bautista and Cooper as Gamora, Drax and Rocket, respectively.[9] At the end of the month, Gunn announced the film would be titled Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,[119] saying he \"came up with a LOT of titles for Vol. 2. But because 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is already so wordy, it seemed strange to add another bunch of words after it. I liked Vol. 2 the best, so that's what I stuck on the cover of the screenplay—and, fortunately, [Marvel] liked it\".[120]\n\nIn September 2015, Gunn said in a Facebook post that he wanted to use Sneepers, an alien race that first appeared in Marvel Comics in 1964, as background characters in the film, but was advised against it by Marvel's legal department because the name was too similar to snípur, the Icelandic word for clitoris.[121] The Marvel legal department later cleared the use of Sneepers in the film, in part because of all the media coverage Gunn's initial post received.[122] At the end of the month, Feige stated casting announcements would be made before the end of 2015,[123] and by the end of October, Pom Klementieff was cast as Mantis.[41][124] Also, it was reported that Matthew McConaughey had recently turned down the role of \"the villain\" in the film,[125] in favor of The Dark Tower (2017). McConaughey felt he would have been \"an amendment\" in Vol. 2 in \"a colorful part [made] for another big-name actor\".[126] In December, Gunn said that he was corresponding with John C. Reilly about him reprising his role as Nova Corpsman Rhomann Dey,[127] while Kurt Russell entered early talks to play Quill's father.[128] After the death of David Bowie in January 2016, Gunn said that there had been discussions for Bowie to appear in the film as a member of Yondu's original crew.[129][130] Gunn also stated that he had completed the final draft of the script.[131] Benicio del Toro, who portrayed the Collector in the first film, expressed interest in portraying the character again, despite Marvel not contacting him about the sequel;[132] Gunn explained that the Collector \"just didn't fit\" into Vol. 2.[133] In early February, comedian Steve Agee was revealed to be in the film.[64]\n\nProp master Russell Bobbitt had difficulty finding the cassette decks that had been used in the first film, and all of the Sony Walkman headsets they sourced for the sequel were broken. Sony also did not have any headsets available for filming, while three pairs Bobbitt found on eBay cost around $1,800 and were not the exact model. Bobbitt eventually created six from scratch for Vol. 2. Other props he created for the film included two sets of blasters for Quill, with removable blaster cartridges, and \"steampunk-looking weapons and belts\" for the Ravagers;[25] Bobbitt explained that four different weapons were designed for the latter group, and then 15–20 versions of those were produced to be used by the various Ravager actors (there could be up to 85–95 Ravagers per scene). For their belts, the props team cut the leather themselves rather than buying existing belts, and then parts from different electronic devices such as radios and cell phones were glued together to make each belt \"a unique piece of art\". The prop department also made edible props for certain scenes: a prop of a stinkbug-inspired insect was made from chocolate and injected with black honey so it could be eaten on screen and \"when he bit down the honey poured out of his mouth\"; similarly, a \"yarrow root\" was designed based on enlarged images of pollen, and then created with non-dairy white chocolate to be eaten onscreen.[36]\n\nPre-shooting began on February 11, 2016,[134] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[135] under the working title Level Up,[97] with Henry Braham serving as cinematographer and Scott Chambliss as production designer.[9][136] Gunn noted that many of the crew from the first film, such as cinematographer Ben Davis and production designer Charles Wood, signed on to work on Doctor Strange (2016), and due to a late change in production schedule for that film, were unable to work on Vol. 2.[137][138]\n\nPrincipal photography began on February 17,[48] with Marvel confirming that Russell had joined the cast, and revealing that Elizabeth Debicki and Chris Sullivan had also been cast, all in undisclosed roles.[48] The production used all 18 stages at Pinewood Atlanta Studios, an increase in stage space from what was used for the first film. Gunn said the sequel required more sets than the first and \"our sets are very large, even though a lot of the film is CGI. I like to have as many practical sets as we can and make the environments as real as possible so it balances out the CGI elements\". Despite this, Gunn noted that there were less locations featured in the sequel, with the focus instead on being more specific and detailed with fewer places shown. Sets constructed for the film included several for the Sovereign planet, for which Chambliss used a \"1950s pulp fiction variation on 1930s art deco design aesthetic\"; the Ravager's main ship in the film, the Eclector, which was constructed in sections to provide a complete 360-degree view of the ship as well as the ability to move sections around and portray different areas of the ship; and the Iron Lotus establishment on the \"pleasure planet\" of Contraxia, which Chambliss wanted to feel like it had been put together from \"a whole yard of repurposed junk where old spaceships are cast away and industrial materials that aren't of use anymore are just left to rot\", creating a \"kind of neon jungle in its own way and covered in ice and snow\". Interiors for other ships were also constructed, to limit the amount of blue screen the actors had to interact with;[36] this includes the cockpit of Quill's ship that had been built for the first film before being stored in London which was transported to Atlanta for the sequel.[139] Originally shot was a scene featuring Star-Lord and Gamora kissing, establishing themselves as a couple, but Gunn ultimately cut the scene due to feeling that the kiss happened in a \"weird time\". He would later beg the Infinity War filmmakers to include the kiss there.[117]\n\nVol. 2 was the first film to be shot with an 8K resolution camera, the Red Weapon 8K.[140] Braham had wanted to use a different camera than the Alexa 65 that had been used for several other Marvel films, because he found it to be a \"very big and heavy camera\". He wanted a camera that could deliver equivalent image quality to the Alexa 65, and tested multiple options. He eventually met with Red employees, whom he had a positive experience with working on The Legend of Tarzan (2016), and they introduced him to an early prototype for the Weapon 8K. He, Gunn, and Marvel decided to use the camera in September 2015, when only that single prototype existed, and spent three months working with Red to get the camera ready for filming.[139] For the sequence where Rocket and Yondu escape from the Ravagers, a Phantom Camera was used to film scenes up to 2,000 frames per second, with the footage able to be moved from slow-motion to high-speed within a single shot. Each shot using the camera had to be carefully set up and choreographed.[141] Additional scenes were also shot in IMAX and its aspect ratio.[97] Braham filmed almost 85 percent of the film using a stabilizing technology he had contributed to called Stabileye, which he called \"a handheld dolly\" which allowed \"a spontaneity to the way the camera moves that is different and that felt appropriate for this movie\". For filming the cockpits of spaceships, Braham surrounded the practical sets with video panels and other light sources that he could use to create realistic lighting no matter the environment outside the ship. Exteriors of the ships were filmed with the camera on a technocrane, but any shots inside the cockpits again used the Stabileye which is \"so small that you can get it in there next to the actors\".[139]\n\nIn April 2016, Gunn revealed that Reilly would not be part of the film, and stated that there were many other characters he could not include in the film due to rights issues, saying that 20th Century Fox \"owns so many awesome cosmic villains and minor characters that I'd love to play around with\" such as Annihilus and Kang the Conqueror.[133] Gunn also planned on filming scenes with Glenn Close, reprising her role as Nova Prime Irani Rael from the first film.[21]: 4  When filming Stan Lee's cameo, Gunn also filmed two other cameo appearances with Lee including one for Doctor Strange, to limit the amount of travel Lee had to do.[78][142] Additional filming for Vol. 2 took place in Cartersville, Georgia,[143] a state park north of Portland, Oregon,[29] and in St. Charles, Missouri.[144] The Georgia International Convention Center served as additional soundstage space after pre-production on Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) began at several Pinewood Atlanta Studios soundstages.[97] Principal photography wrapped on June 16, 2016.[145]\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in 2016, Russell and Debicki were revealed to be playing Ego, Quill's father, and Ayesha, respectively.[34] Sylvester Stallone was also revealed to be in the film,[34] with his role later revealed as Stakar Ogord.[44] Gunn also introduced multiple actors who were playing Ravager characters, since the Ravagers have a larger presence in the film.[57] On the decision to reveal Russell as Ego and Quill's father when he did, Gunn felt that since \"people were going to figure it out eventually [...] it was better that we took the reins in our own hands\" and make the reveal. Gunn also felt that this would move the focus of audiences from wanting to discover who Quill's father is to \"the story and the relationship that these characters have\".[146] In August 2016, Gunn confirmed the film would feature a post-credits scene,[111] later stating there would be five in total, with four mid-credits scenes and one post-credits.[147][148] Gunn also planned a sixth scene, where the Ravager Gef is found \"mortally wounded\" on the ship, but \"it ended up being a little confusing\".[149]\n\nIn November, Gillan revealed that the film was undergoing reshoots.[150] That February, it was reported that the film had scored a perfect 100 in test screenings, the highest for any Marvel Studios film. The Hollywood Reporter noted this score could not necessarily be compared to any non-Marvel movies due to Marvel's specific testing process that selects its audience \"from a more select pool of recruits, what it terms 'friends and families screenings'\".[151] In March 2017, Gunn revealed that Michael Rosenbaum would appear in the film,[46] and that Gunn would provide reference for Baby Groot's dancing \"in a much bigger way [than the first film]. I actually had to do like a full day's worth of dancing to get Groot's dance down this time. Last time it was me in front of an iPhone, and this time it's me dancing on a huge soundstage and shooting it from five different angles\".[152] Fred Raskin and Craig Wood returned from the first film to serve as editors.[48] On scenes that were cut from the film, Gunn said Nathan Fillion, who had had a voice cameo in the first film, was going to appear as Simon Williams in a sequence that would have shown several movie posters for films starring Williams, including films in which he portrays Arkon and Tony Stark.[153][154] Gunn chose Williams for Fillion's cameo because he wanted Fillion to have a bigger role in the MCU at some point and so did not want to give him a role that could prevent him from taking a more substantial one later. Gunn still considered Fillion's cameo canon to the MCU, despite it being cut.[155] He also confirmed that Close's scenes had been cut from the film, because it felt like he \"was trying to cram Nova Prime into the second movie as opposed to having it happen organically\".[78]\n\nVisual effects for the film were created by Framestore, Weta Digital, Trixter, Method Studios, Animal Logic, Scanline VFX, Lola VFX, Luma, and Cantina Creative.[156] Previsualization was done by The Third Floor.[157] Framestore created 620 shots for the film, Weta Digital created 530, Method Studios more than 500, and Animal Logic created 147.[29] Framestore once again created Rocket and Groot,[29][158] with Method Studios, Weta Digital and Trixter also working on Rocket. Framestore rebuilt Rocket \"from the ground up\" for Vol. 2, giving him an updated fur simulation, new facial shapes and phonemes, as well as a new eye rig, which came from a rig used for the character Gnarlack from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016).[29] Trixter's work on Rocket included when he sets off a trap for the Ravagers, additionally working on the sequence when Rocket, Yondu and Kraglin jump across space.[29] Other work from Framestore included creatures, spaceships,[29] Ayesha's lair, the space chase, the Eclector scenes, and the adolescent Groot post-credit scene.[159]\n\nFramestore also created the film's opening sequence.[29] Despite appearing as a single shot, it ultimately was composed of 11 different visual effect shots. Gunn provided reference video for Baby Groot's dancing in the sequence.[157] Framestore animation supervisor Arslan Elver noted that the majority of the opening sequence includes CGI and digital doubles, with three moments (Quill falling on the ground near Baby Groot, Gamora talking to Baby Groot, and Drax rolling behind Baby Groot) consisting of actual photography.[159] As with the first film, Sarofsky created the typography for the opening, using the same style from Guardians of the Galaxy for consistency, \"this time in rusty gold and glowing blue neon\". Executive Creative Director Erin Sarofsky noted the challenge of placing the credits while the sequence was being refined by Framestore. Sarofsky proposed several different options for the credits, including having \"a little hovering character that projected a hologram up on the screen\", but Gunn did not want another character in the sequence to deal with. A simpler 2D option was used instead. Sarofsky also worked on the end credits, the first time for the company, integrating the actual credits from company Exceptional Minds with designs inspired by old music album art, taking albums and scanning them for their old textures and scratches.[159]\n\nThe destruction of the Ravager ship the Eclector was handled by Weta Digital.[160] Weta Digital also handled Ego during his fight with Quill, utilizing a digital double of Russell for many of their shots. Weta also needed to create a digital double for David Hasselhoff for the moment when Ego shifts into Hasselhoff's guise. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We tried morphing to a live-action Hoff—but it did not hold up as well. The Kurt version looked better than the Hoff version ... and while we had built a very detailed Kurt digi-double ... we didn't want to go to the same level on the Hoff for just two shots. But in the end we did have to do a partial build digi-double of the Hoff. The reason we did the Kurt digi-double in the first place was to make sure all the effects stuck correctly to the body ... so we went with the approach of a full digi-double, the hair, the side of the face everything on Kurt. For the Hoff, we got pretty close, but it is not quite as detailed as for Kurt\".[161] Additional work by Weta included the inside of Ego's planet, known as the Planet Hollow, which was inspired by the fractal art of Hal Tenny, who Gunn hired to help design Ego's environment.[158][162] Gunn added that there are \"over a trillion polygons on Ego's planet,\" calling it \"the biggest visual effect of all time. There's nothing even close to it\".[162]\n\nAnimal Logic and Method Studios also worked on the various parts of Ego's planet, with Animal Logic focusing on Ego's cathedral, and Method on the arrival sequence and Baby Groot's \"not that button\" sequence in the Planet Hollow. Animal Logic's work for Ego's cathedral was also based on fractal art. The team at Animal Logic were initially brought on to the film to work on the story vignettes that were used to explain the backstory, which started as oil paintings before evolving to falling sand, and eventually the final plastic sculptures that were used. Method also created the film's final sequence for Yondu's funeral. To make Rocket shedding a tear convincing, Method used in-house footage of Animation Supervisor Keith Roberts \"performing the scene for reference, studying the macro facial movements like minor eye darts or blinks, in addition to what was filmed on set and in the sound booth by\" Cooper. Additional work included the scenes on the planet Berhart.[29] Lola VFX worked on de-aging Russell, having previously done similar work in other MCU films; they also added to various characters, including Nebula. To achieve the younger Ego, Lola referenced Russell's performance in Used Cars (1980), as \"he had a lot of the [facial] action\" the visual effects artists were looking for. They also used a younger stand in, Aaron Schwartz, since he had \"big broad jaw, chin, and most importantly the way the laugh lines move[d] and crease[d] as he talk[ed]\", similar to Russell's.[161] Laura Haddock, reprising her role from the first film of Meredith Quill in the sequence, was also slightly de-aged to play the younger version of that character.[144] Luma worked on the Sovereign people and their world, and Adam Warlock's cocoon.[29]\n\nBy August 2014, Gunn had \"some ideas listed, but nothing for sure\" in terms of songs to include in Quill's Awesome Mix Vol. 2 mixtape,[101] for which he felt \"a little pressure\" due to the positive response to the first film's soundtrack. Gunn added, \"But I feel like the soundtrack in the second one is better.\"[163] By June 2015, Gunn had chosen all of the songs and built them into the script,[9] calling Awesome Mix Vol. 2 \"more diverse\" than the first one, with \"some really incredibly famous songs and then some songs that people have never heard.\"[164] Tyler Bates was confirmed to score the film by August 2015, returning from the first film.[165] As with Guardians of the Galaxy, Bates wrote some of the score first so Gunn could film to the music, as opposed to Bates scoring to the film.[127] Recording for the score occurred in January 2017 at Abbey Road Studios.[166] Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Awesome Mix Volume 2, along with the film score album composed by Bates, were released on April 21, 2017.[167][168] A cassette version of Awesome Mix Volume 2 was released on June 23, 2017, while a deluxe-edition vinyl LP featuring both Awesome Mix Volume 2 and Bates' score was released on August 11, 2017.[169]\n\nIn June 2016, Marvel announced plans for an expanded merchandising program for the sequel, with Groot playing a central role.[170] Gunn ensured the film's female characters received more representation in the merchandise than in the first.[171] Paul Gitter, senior vice president of licensing at Disney Consumer Products, said they intended to build Guardians of the Galaxy into a tentpole franchise. Partners in the campaign included Hasbro, Lego, Funko, LB Kids,[170] GEICO, Ford Motor Company, Go-Gurt, Hanes, Synchrony Bank, Dairy Queen, M&M's, Screenvision, Sprint Corporation, and Wrigley Company.[172] Additionally, Marvel partnered with Doritos for their Rock Out Loud campaign to create a custom \"limited-edition series of Doritos bags featuring a built-in cassette tape deck-inspired player that plays\" Awesome Mix Vol. 2 and can be recharged. The custom bags were available to purchase on Amazon.com, with Doritos also hosting Rock Out Loud pop-up recording booths in New York and Los Angeles where fans could sing the songs from Awesome Mix Vol. 2 and have the opportunity to win various prizes, including the custom bags, concert tickets, and free bags of Doritos.\"[173]\n\nIn July 2016, Gunn, Pratt and other members of the cast attended San Diego Comic-Con to promote the film,[174] showing footage and revealing additional character information.[34] On October 19, a \"sneak peek\" teaser was released ahead of the first full teaser trailer. Ethan Anderton of /Film felt the teaser was strong, despite not showing any of the new characters or relying on Baby Groot,[175] while The A.V. Club's Esther Zuckerman called it \"an immediate crowd-pleaser\".[176] According to media-measurement firm Comscore and its PreAct service, the teaser was the top trailer for the week it released, generating 108,000 new social media conversations.[177] In early December, before Gunn revealed the first teaser trailer at Comic Con Experience 2016,[178][179] he said that finding scenes and moments to showcase in the trailer without revealing too much of the film resulted in hard choices, since \"people really go through every single little shot and try to figure out what the movie's about. And there's a lot of mysteries in Guardians 2.\"[180] Describing the teaser trailer, Jacob Hall of /Film noted that the trailer was able to succeed without giving too much away as it focused on character interactions rather than plot.[181] The teaser trailer received 81 million views in 24 hours, becoming the second-most viewed teaser behind Beauty and the Beast and largest Marvel Studios teaser ever. Additionally, Sweet's \"Fox on the Run\" reached number one on the iTunes Rock Chart after featuring in the teaser.[182]\n\nA second trailer aired during Super Bowl LI. Germain Lussier for io9 called it \"hilarious\",[183] while Anderton said it was \"one hell of a\" Super Bowl spot, \"one that probably overshadows the game itself for people like me... There's plenty of badass cosmic action, the humor we all love, a stellar soundtrack, and some great new footage from the sequel.\"[184] The spot generated the most Twitter conversation volume during the game with 47,800 conversations, according to Comscore, who measured the volume of trailers that aired during the game from the time it aired through the end of the game. The film also topped a Fandango survey of fans' favorite film trailer during the Super Bowl.[185] An additional trailer debuted on February 28, 2017, on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Haleigh Foutch at Collider felt the trailer added \"hype\" to the film, and was \"just an all-around wonderful trailer, lit up with the wacky humor and irreverent charm that made the first film such a hit, with an extra dose of visual splendor.\"[186] Pratt and Saldaña appeared at the 2017 Kids' Choice Awards, where they debuted an exclusive clip.[187] In mid-July, Marvel created a 1980s-inspired infomercial and an 800 number to promote the film's home media release.[188]\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 made its world premiere in Tokyo on April 10, 2017,[189] and its Hollywood, Los Angeles, premiere on April 19 at the Dolby Theatre.[190] The film began its international release on April 25, in Australia, New Zealand, and Italy,[191] alongside a total of 37 markets in its first weekend, with 176 IMAX screens in 35 of those markets.[192] Its North American release on May 5 took place in 4,347 theaters, of which over 3,800 were in 3D,[193] 388 in IMAX and IMAX 3D,[193][194] 588 premium large-format, and 194 D-Box locations.[193] The film's opening in China was in 400 IMAX theaters, the largest ever for the country.[195] On May 4, 2017, 550 theaters in the United States had a special RealD Guardians of the Galaxy double feature event before preview screenings of Vol. 2. Guests who attended received an exclusive mini poster and a set of souvenir collectible buttons.[196] Vol. 2 was originally intended to be released on July 28, 2017.[88] The film is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[197]\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on August 8, 2017, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Ultra HD Blu-ray, and DVD on August 22.[198][199] The Ultra HD Blu-ray version is the first Disney home media release in 4K resolution.[200] The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, and a music video for the song \"Guardians Inferno\". The digital release also exclusively features the breakdown of three scenes, from their initial ideas to their completed versions, and a behind-the-scenes look at the Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout!, an accelerated drop tower dark ride attraction at Disney California Adventure.[198] The 1970s-style music video for \"Guardians Inferno\" was directed by David Yarovesky and features Hasselhoff alongside James Gunn, Pratt, Saldaña, Bautista, Klementieff, Gillan, Rooker, and Sean Gunn. Stan Lee and Guillermo Rodriguez also make cameo appearances in the video.[201][202]\n\nThe digital release of the film had the most digital downloads and largest opening week of any Marvel Studios film.[203] The physical releases in its first week of sale were the top home media release, selling \"nearly three times as many discs as the rest of the top 10 sellers combined\", according to NPD VideoScan data. The Blu-ray version accounted for 83% of the sales, with 10% of total sales coming from the Ultra HD Blu-ray version.[204] In its second week, the film was once again the top home media release.[205] As well, total sales of Vol. 2 in the United Kingdom were more than the other films in the top 40 combined; it was also the top film in the country.[206] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[207]\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 grossed over $389.8 million in the United States and Canada, and over $473.9 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $863.8 million.[2] The film had earlier surpassed the first film's gross ($773 million) by Memorial Day weekend, three weeks after release, with $783.3 million worldwide,[208] and became the fifth-highest-grossing MCU film a week later.[209] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $157 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it ninth on their list of 2017's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[210]\n\nSince tickets went on sale on April 24, 2017, the film was the number one seller on Fandango, and surpassed the advance sales of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) in the similar time frame.[211] Over 80% of sales on MovieTickets.com were for the film ahead of its release.[193] Vol. 2 earned $146.5 million in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada,[212] with IMAX contributing $13 million.[195] The $17 million that came from Thursday night previews was the highest preview amount of 2017.[193] The film had previously been projected to earn upwards of $160 million in its opening weekend,[196][213] with Deadline Hollywood predicting it could reach the $179 million debut of Captain America: Civil War.[214] It remained at number one in its second weekend,[215] and fell to second in its third, behind Alien: Covenant.[216] Vol. 2 remained at number two in its fourth weekend, this time behind Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, and crossed $337.6 million, surpassing the domestic gross of the first film.[217] By its fifth weekend, the film fell to fourth,[218] and in its next, fell to fifth.[219] Vol. 2 continued to remain in the top 10 for two more weeks, placing ninth in its seventh weekend,[220] and tenth in its eighth weekend.[221]\n\nOutside of the United States and Canada, the film earned $106 million in its first weekend from 37 markets, becoming the top film in them all except Portugal, Turkey, and Vietnam. IMAX contributed $5 million to the opening-weekend gross. The film also outperformed the original's opening weekend in all markets except Belgium.[192] In its second weekend, the sequel opened as the top film in South Korea, China, and Russia.[195] It had the highest opening for an MCU film in Austria,[192] the second-highest in Australia ($11.8 million), the Netherlands ($500,000),[191][192] Germany ($9.3 million), and the United Kingdom ($16.9 million),[192] and the third-highest in New Zealand ($400,000), Italy ($1.4 million),[191] and Russia ($11.6 million).[195] The New Zealand and Netherlands openings were also the highest of 2017 for the countries,[191] while Germany and the United Kingdom's were the second-highest.[191][192] In South Korea, it had the biggest opening day ($3.3 million) and second-best opening weekend ($13.3 million) of 2017, the latter surpassing the original's entire earnings in the country. It also had the biggest May opening day and the third-highest opening day for an MCU film there.[195][222] Ukraine had the second-largest opening ever, while in Puerto Rico, the film had the largest IMAX opening.[195] More markets saw their gross for Vol. 2 surpass the total gross from the first film in its third weekend,[223] with China following in its fourth.[224] The next weekend saw Vol. 2's gross outside the United States and Canada ($451.1 million) surpass the international gross of the first film ($440 million).[208] Vol. 2's three biggest markets in total earnings were: China ($99.3 million), the United Kingdom ($51.3 million), and Germany ($28 million).[209]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 85%, with an average score of 7.3/10, based on 425 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2's action-packed plot, dazzling visuals, and irreverent humor add up to a sequel that's almost as fun—if not quite as thrillingly fresh—as its predecessor.\"[225] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[226] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 93% overall positive score and a 77% \"definite recommend\".[193]\n\nOwen Gleiberman of Variety called the film \"an extravagant and witty follow-up, made with the same friendly virtuosic dazzle... and just obligatory enough to be too much of a good thing.\" He cautioned that \"this time you can sense just how hard [Gunn] is working to entertain you. Maybe a little too hard.\"[227] Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers described the film as a \"blast\" and gave it three stars out of four, praising the film for its tone and fun, soundtrack, and characters. He noted that \"Vol. 2 can't match the sneak-attack surprise of its predecessor...[but] the followup, while taking on some CGI bloat and sequel slickness, hasn't lost its love for inspired lunacy.[228] Chicago Sun-Times' Richard Roeper also gave the film three stars, calling it not \"quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original—but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch.\" Roeper continued that \"even with all the silliness and all the snarkiness, the Guardians can put a lump in your throat\", and praised the cast, especially Rooker, with \"one of the best roles in the movie\".[229] In his review for RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as \"a thoroughly enjoyable summer blockbuster\" that does not take itself seriously, avoiding \"many of the flaws of the first movie, and [doing] several things notably better. It's fun, clever and a great kick-off to the summer movie season.\"[230]\n\nAt The Washington Post, Michael O'Sullivan gave the film four stars, praising it as being \"funnier, nuttier, and more touching\" than the first film. O'Sullivan felt it avoided usual sequel problems by building on the original film rather than repeating it, and also noted the use of music as well as \"dazzling\" visuals throughout, describing the film as \"a toe-tapping, eye-popping indication that summer is here, and that it might not be so bad after all.\"[231] Brian Lowry, writing for CNN.com, criticized the middle portion of the film and its villain, but felt the film fared better than other Marvel sequels with its strong beginning and end, and \"good-natured energy\", saying it \"ultimately shares just enough with its central quintet—rather heroically getting the job done, even if the trip from here to there can be a bit disjointed and messy.\"[232] For The Atlantic, Christopher Orr felt the film did not live up to the original, particularly due to its heavier themes and feeling that Russell was \"badly miscast\", but the rest of the cast, soundtrack, and humor were enough for him to give an overall positive review.[233]\n\nAt The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy said \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 plays like a second ride on a roller-coaster that was a real kick the first time around but feels very been-there/done-that now.\"[234] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times was positive of the film's soundtrack and cast, especially Russell, but felt Gunn was trying too hard to re-capture the magic of the first film, and the increased scope of effects and action becomes weary. Turan concluded, \"There are enough reminders of the first Guardians to make the sequel an acceptable experience, [but it's] less like itself and more like a standard Marvel production.\"[235] Manohla Dargis at The New York Times said the film \"certainly has its attractions, but most of them are visual rather than narrative.\" She also felt Gunn was trying too hard, and found many elements of the sequel to be too serious even with Russell balancing that with a much-needed \"unforced looseness\".[236] Anthony Lane in his review for The New Yorker felt once Ego was introduced, the film began to suffer from \"the curse of the backstory\" and that the \"point that the movie, which has been motoring along nicely, fuelled by silliness and pep, begins to splutter\" was when Ego's desire for larger meaning is revealed. Lane concluded, \"Let's hope that Vol. 3 recaptures the fizz of the original, instead of slumping into the most expensive group-therapy session in the universe.\"[237]\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was released on May 5, 2023,[256] with Gunn returning to write and direct.[257][258] Pratt, Saldaña, Bautista, Diesel, Cooper,[259] Gillan,[260] Klementieff,[261] and Sean Gunn reprise their roles in the film,[262] and are joined by Will Poulter as Adam Warlock.[6]\n\nIn December 2020, I Am Groot, a series of animated short films focused on Baby Groot, was announced for Disney+.[263] Diesel reprises his role, with all five shorts released on August 10, 2022.[264]\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special is a Marvel Studios Special Presentation that was released on Disney+ on November 25, 2022,[265][266] with Gunn writing and directing.[263] Pratt, Bautista, Diesel, Cooper, Gillan, Klementieff, Rooker, and Sean Gunn reprise their roles in the special,[267] which is set before the events of Vol. 3.[268]\n"

        "content": "\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming is a 2017 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the second Spider-Man film reboot and the 16th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts from a screenplay by the writing teams of Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. Tom Holland stars as  Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Michael Keaton, Jon Favreau, Gwyneth Paltrow, Zendaya, Donald Glover, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Tyne Daly, Marisa Tomei, and Robert Downey Jr. In the film, Parker tries to balance high school life with being Spider-Man while facing the Vulture (Keaton).\n\nIn February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony reached a deal to share the film rights for Spider-Man, integrating the character into the established MCU. The following June, Holland was cast as the title character, and Watts was hired to direct. This was followed shortly by the hiring of Daley and Goldstein. In April 2016, the film's title was revealed, along with additional cast, including Downey in his MCU role of Tony Stark / Iron Man. Principal photography began in June 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, and continued in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City. The other screenwriters were revealed during filming, which concluded in Berlin in October 2016. The production team made efforts to differentiate the film from previous Spider-Man films.\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 28, 2017, and was released in the United States on July 7, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. Homecoming grossed over $880 million worldwide, becoming the second-most-successful Spider-Man film and the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2017. It received praise for the light tone, its focus on Parker's high school life, and the performances, particularly of Holland and Keaton. Two sequels have been released: Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). A new trilogy of live-action films from Sony and Marvel Studios is in development.\n\nFollowing the Battle of New York in 2012,[a] Adrian Toomes and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but their operation is taken over by the Department of Damage Control (DODC), a partnership between Tony Stark and the U.S. government. Enraged at being driven out of business, Toomes persuades his employees to keep the Chitauri technology they have already scavenged and use it to create and sell advanced weapons, including a flying Vulture suit Toomes uses to steal Chitauri power cells.\n\nEight years later,[b] after being drafted into the Avengers by Stark to help with an internal dispute in Germany,[c] Peter Parker resumes his studies at the Midtown School of Science and Technology when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full-time Avenger. Parker quits his school's academic decathlon team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. His best friend, Ned, eventually discovers his secret identity.\n\nParker comes across Toomes's associates Jackson Brice / Shocker and Herman Schultz selling weapons to local criminal Aaron Davis. Parker saves Davis before being caught by Toomes in the Vulture suit and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of their weapons and Schultz becomes the new Shocker.\n\nParker and Ned study a weapon Brice left behind, removing its power core. When a tracking device on Schultz leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a DODC truck but is trapped inside, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, he races to the Washington Monument, where the core is activated and explodes, trapping Ned and their friends in an elevator. Parker saves them, including his classmate and crush Liz. Days later, in New York City, aboard the Staten Island Ferry, Parker captures Toomes's new buyer Mac Gargan but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers, but confiscates his suit as punishment for his recklessness.\n\nParker returns to his high school life and asks Liz to go to the homecoming dance with him. On the night of the dance, he discovers that Toomes is Liz's father. Deducing Parker's secret identity, Toomes threatens him. Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a DODC plane transporting weapons from Avengers Tower to the team's new headquarters in Upstate New York. He leaves the dance and dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit. Though he is ambushed outside by Schultz, he defeats him with Ned's help. He races to Toomes's lair, where Toomes attacks Parker, destroying the building's support columns, and leaves Parker to die, trapped in the rubble of the collapsed building. Parker escapes and intercepts the plane, steering it to crash on the beach at Coney Island. He and Toomes continue fighting, ending with Parker saving Toomes's life after the damaged Vulture suit explodes. Parker leaves Toomes for the police along with the plane's cargo. After her father's arrest, Liz moves away. Parker declines an invitation from Stark to join the Avengers full time, and Stark proposes to Pepper Potts. Stark also returns the Spider-Man suit to Parker, who puts it on just as his aunt May walks in.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, an incarcerated Gargan approaches Toomes in prison, saying he has heard that the latter knows Spider-Man's real identity, though Toomes denies this.\n\nAdditionally, Kerry Condon and Chris Evans reprise their roles as F.R.I.D.A.Y. and Steve Rogers / Captain America from previous MCU films, respectively.[60][61] Rogers appears in public service announcements played at Parker's school.[61] Garcelle Beauvais portrays Doris Toomes, Adrian's wife and Liz's mother,[62][63] and Jennifer Connelly provides the voice of Karen, the A.I. in Parker's suit.[60] Hemky Madera appears as Mr. Delmar, the owner of a local bodega, while Gary Weeks portrays Damage Control agent Foster.[64] Logan Marshall-Green plays Jackson Brice, the first Shocker, who is an accomplice of Toomes who uses modified, vibro-blast shooting versions of Brock Rumlow's gauntlets.[21][65][66] Other business partners of Toomes include: Michael Chernus as Phineas Mason,[16][67] Michael Mando as Mac Gargan,[49][68] and Christopher Berry as Randy Vale.[64][69]\n\nFaculty at Parker's high school include: Kenneth Choi, who previously played Jim Morita in the MCU, as Jim's descendant Principal Morita;[66][70] Hannibal Buress as Coach Wilson,[71] the school's gym teacher, who he described as \"one of the dumbass characters that don't realize [Parker is] Spider-Man\";[72][73] Martin Starr, who reprises his previously unnamed role from The Incredible Hulk (2008),[74] as Mr. Harrington,[66] a teacher and academic decathlon coach;[75][76] Selenis Leyva as Ms. Warren;[77][78] Tunde Adebimpe as Mr. Cobbwell;[64] and John Penick as Mr. Hapgood.[79] Parker's classmates include: Isabella Amara as Sally;[80][81] Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Jason Ionello;[80][82] Josie Totah[d] as Seymour;[80][83] Abraham Attah as Abraham;[66][84] Tiffany Espensen as Cindy;[62][85] Angourie Rice as Betty Brant;[86][87] Michael Barbieri as Charles;[82][88][89] and Ethan Dizon as Tiny.[82] Martha Kelly appears in the film as a tour guide,[64][90] Zach Cherry appears as a street vendor who asks Spider-Man to \"do a flip\",[91] and Kirk Thatcher makes a cameo appearance as a \"punk\", an homage to his role in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986).[92] Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee also has a cameo, as a New York City apartment resident named Gary who witnesses Parker's confrontation with a neighbor.[93][94]\n\nThere are so many things from the comics that haven't been done yet ... stories [that Spider-Man is] in high school for a lot of it. We want to explore that. That also makes him very, very different from any of our other characters in the MCU\n\nFollowing the November 2014 hacking of Sony's computers, emails between Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal and president Doug Belgrad were released, stating that Sony wanted Marvel Studios to produce a new trilogy of Spider-Man films while Sony retained \"creative control, marketing, and distribution\". Discussions between Sony and Marvel broke down, and Sony planned to proceed with its own slate of Spider-Man films.[96] However, in February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that they would release a new Spider-Man film, with Kevin Feige and Pascal producing (the latter through her company Pascal Pictures).[97][98] The character would first appear in an earlier Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film,[97] later revealed to be Captain America: Civil War (2016).[99] Marvel Studios would explore opportunities to integrate MCU characters into future Spider-Man films, which Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, and have final creative control over.[97] Both studios have the ability to terminate the agreement at any point, and no money was exchanged with the deal. However, a small adjustment was made to a 2011 deal that gave Marvel full control of Spider-Man's merchandising rights, in exchange for a one-time payment of $175 million to Sony and paying up to $35 million for each future Spider-Man film rather than receiving their previous five percent of a Spider-Man film's revenue—Marvel could now reduce their $35 million payment if the co-produced film grossed more than $750 million.[100] Marvel Studios still received five percent of first dollar gross for the film.[101] Lone Star Funds also co-financed the film with Sony, via its LSC Film Corporation deal,[102] covering 25 percent of the $175 million budget,[103] while Columbia Pictures officially served as co-producer with Marvel Studios.[104] Sony also paid Marvel Studios an undisclosed producer fee.[105]\n\nMarvel had been working to add Spider-Man to the Marvel Cinematic Universe since at least October 2014, when they announced their slate of Phase Three films, with Feige saying, \"Marvel doesn't announce anything officially until it's set in stone. So we went forward with that Plan A in October, with the Plan B being, if [the deal] were to happen with Sony, how it would all shift. We've been thinking about [the Spider-Man film] as long as we've been thinking about Phase Three.\"[106] Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, producers for The Amazing Spider-Man series, were set to serve as executive producers,[107] with neither director Marc Webb nor actor Andrew Garfield returning for the new film.[108] Sony was reportedly looking for an actor younger than Garfield to play Spider-Man,[107] with Logan Lerman and Dylan O'Brien considered front-runners.[109] In March 2015, Drew Goddard was being considered to write and direct the film,[110][111] while O'Brien said he had not been approached for the role.[112] Goddard, who was previously attached to a Sony film based on the Sinister Six, later said he declined to work on the new film as he thought he \"didn't really have an idea\" for it and struggled with the idea of working on a new film after spending a year working on the Sinister Six film and being in that mindset.[113] The following month, while promoting Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Feige said the character of Peter Parker would be around 15 to 16 years old in the film,[95] which would not be an origin story, since \"there have been two retellings of that origin in the last [thirteen years, so] we are going to take it for granted that people know that, and the specifics\".[106] Parker's Uncle Ben is still referenced in the film,[114] but not by name.[115] There was some discussion to include a direct reference to Ben when Peter is getting ready for his homecoming by the revelation that his wardrobe consisted of Ben's clothes, but the writers desisted because they felt that the moment veered away from Parker's character arc and made Ben's death feel like a \"throwaway line\".[116] Later in April, Nat Wolff, Asa Butterfield, Tom Holland, Timothée Chalamet, and Liam James were under consideration by Sony and Marvel to play Spider-Man,[117] with Holland and Butterfield as the front-runners.[118] Joseph Quinn and Chandler Riggs also auditioned for the role.[119][120]\n\nIn May 2015, Jonathan Levine, Ted Melfi, Jason Moore, the writing team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, and Jared Hess were being considered to direct the film.[121] Butterfield, Holland, Judah Lewis, Matt Lintz, Charlie Plummer, and Charlie Rowe screen-tested for the lead role against Robert Downey Jr., who portrays Tony Stark / Iron Man in the MCU, for \"chemistry\".[122][123] The six were chosen out of a search of over 1,500 actors to test in front of Feige, Pascal, and the Russo brothers—the directors of Captain America: Civil War.[123] Lintz would later be cast as Bruno Carrelli in the Marvel Studios Disney+ series Ms. Marvel (2022).[124] By early June 2015, Levine and Melfi had become the favorites to direct the film, with Daley and Goldstein and Jon Watts also in consideration,[125] while Feige and Pascal narrowed the actors considered to Holland and Rowe, with both screen-testing with Downey again. Holland also tested with Chris Evans, who portrays Steve Rogers / Captain America in the MCU and emerged as the favorite.[122] On June 23, Marvel and Sony officially announced that Holland would star as Spider-Man and that Watts would direct the film.[10] The Russos \"were pretty vocal about who [sic] [they] wanted for the part\", pushing to cast an actor close to the age of Peter Parker to differentiate from the previous portrayals. They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background.[99] Watts was able to read the Civil War script, talk with the Russos, and was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes in that film.[115] He was able to \"see what they were doing with it\" and provide \"ideas about this and that\",[126] including what Parker's bedroom and wardrobe looked like \"so that my movie transitions seamlessly with theirs\".[115] On joining the MCU and directing the film, Watts said he was excited to explore the \"ground level\" of the MCU, a world where characters like the Avengers exist but have only been depicted in previous films at \"the Penthouse level of the Marvel world\".[21]\n\nBefore getting the job of director, Watts created images of Nick Fury as Parker's mentor in the story in early \"mood reels\" saying, \"I don't know what the situation would be, but that would be a person he'd want to get in trouble with.\"[127] Feige said the films of John Hughes would be a major influence and that Parker's personal growth and development would be just as important as his role as Spider-Man. He noted that \"at that age, in high school, everything feels like life or death\". He also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet,[128] and that filming would begin in June 2016.[129] In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt.[50] It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay,[130] and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch;[131] both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay.[132] The pair had proposed a take on the character that was \"diametrically opposed\" to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a laundry list of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character rather than the \"drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man\". They felt this would differentiate him from the other MCU superheroes as well.[19] Daley said the film was about Parker \"finding his place\" in the MCU, with the writing team wanting the film to focus on him \"coming to terms with his new abilities and not yet being good with them, and carrying with him some real human fears and weaknesses\", such as a fear of heights when he has to scale the Washington Monument. Daley noted, \"Even within the context of this movie, I don't think you would feel that fear of heights or even the vertigo the audience feels in that scene if you establish him as swinging from skyscrapers at the top of the movie.\"[17] The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of Manhattan because of how often they were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as \"the suburbs, on a golf course, the Staten Island Ferry, Coney Island, and even Washington, D.C.\" One of the first sequences they pitched was \"seeing Spider-Man attached to a plane 10,000 feet up in the air, where he had absolutely no safety net. ... you're familiar with the sort of areas he's been in, [so] why not turn it on its head and make it something different that people haven't seen before?\"[19] The pair conceded that the film took a more grounded, \"low-stakes\" approach than previous films, which avoided having to explain why the Avengers were not helping, since a world-threatening problem would logically require the \"big guys\".[17]\n\nMarvel encouraged Daley and Goldstein to express their own sense of humor in the script, with Daley saying, \"When you're seeing the world through the eyes of a fun, funny kid, you can really embrace that voice, and not give him the cookie-cutter one-liners that you're so accustomed to hearing from Peter Parker.\" Inspired by their experiences working on sitcoms, the writers also looked to create \"a network of strong characters\" to surround Parker with in the film.[19] In October 2015, Watts said he was looking to make the film a coming-of-age story to see the growth of Parker, citing Can't Buy Me Love (1987), Say Anything... (1989), and Almost Famous (2000) as some of his favorite films in that genre.[133] It was this aspect of the film that had initially got Watts interested in directing it, as he had already been looking to make a coming-of-age story when he heard that the new Spider-Man would be younger than previous incarnations.[134] Watts re-read the original Spider-Man comics in preparation for the film, and \"came to a new realization\" about the character's original popularity, feeling that he introduced a new perspective to the comics that had already established \"a crazy spectacular Marvel Universe ... to give a regular person's perspective on it\". He felt that this was also the responsibility of this film since it had to introduce Spider-Man to the already established MCU.[115] Specific comics that Watts noted as potential influences were Ultimate Spider-Man (2000-2011) and Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane (2004-2009).[134] In December, Oliver Scholl signed on to be the production designer for the film.[135]\n\nWatts wanted to heavily pre-visualize the film, especially its action sequences, as he does on all his films. For Homecoming, Watts worked with a team to \"figure out the visual language for the action sequences and ... try stuff out before\" filming began to help Watts practice given his lack of experience working on large-scale films. For the \"web-slinging\" sequences, Watts wanted to avoid the big \"swoopy\" camera moves that had been previously used and instead \"keep it all as grounded as possible. So, whether it was shooting with a drone camera or a helicopter or a cable-cam, or even just handheld, up on a roof chasing after him, I wanted it to feel like we were there with him.\"[134]\n\nIn January 2016, Sony shifted the film's release date from July 28, 2017, to July 7, 2017,[136] and said the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D in post-production.[137] J. K. Simmons expressed interest in reprising his role as J. Jonah Jameson from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films.[138] In early March, Zendaya was cast in the film as Michelle, and Tomei was confirmed as May Parker.[51][139] The following month, Feige confirmed that characters from previous MCU films would appear,[140] and clarified that the deal formed with Sony does not specify which characters can and cannot crossover.[141] He noted that the sharing between the studios was done with \"good faith\" in order \"to have more toys to play with as we put together a story\",[7] and that \"the agreement was that it is very much a Sony Pictures movie... we are the creative producers. We are the ones hiring the actor, introducing him in [Civil War], and then working right now on the script and soon to be shooting.\"[141] Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman further added that Sony has final greenlight authority, but were deferring creatively to Marvel.[142] At CinemaCon 2016, Sony announced the title of the film to be Spider-Man: Homecoming,[143][144] a reference to the common high school tradition homecoming as well as the character \"coming home\" to Marvel and the MCU.[144] Tony Revolori – who had auditioned for Peter Parker[145] – and Laura Harrier joined the cast as classmates of Parker's,[42][146] and Downey Jr. was revealed to be in the film as Stark.[57][147] Watts noted that Stark \"was always a part of\" the film's story because of his interactions with Parker in Civil War.[134] Downey Jr. was paid $10 million for his involvement.[148]\n\nAlso in April, Michael Keaton entered talks to play a villain,[149] but dropped out of discussions shortly thereafter due to scheduling conflicts with The Founder (2016).[150][151] At this point, John Leguizamo was approached to fill the role and entered negotiations to do so.[152] Keaton soon reentered talks for the role after a change in schedule for The Founder,[151][153] which necessitated Marvel to ask Leguizamo if he would step away from the role in order to cast Keaton;[152] Keaton closed the deal in late May.[153] Marvel offered to cast Leguizamo in another role, which he considered \"tiny\" and declined.[152] Mark Hamill was interested in playing the film's villain in case Keaton turned down the offer, but Keaton reconsidered the offer in time.[154] In June, Michael Barbieri was cast as a friend of Parker's,[88][89] Kenneth Choi was cast as Parker's high school principal,[70] and Logan Marshall-Green was cast as another villain alongside Keaton's character,[65][68] while Donald Glover and Martin Starr joined the cast in undisclosed roles.[33][75] Watts said that he wanted the cast to reflect Queens as \"one of [the] most diverse places in the world\",[126] with Feige adding that \"we want everyone to recognize themselves in every portion of our universe. [With this cast] especially, it really feels like this is absolutely what has to happen and continue.\"[43] This is also different from the previous films, which were \"set in a lily-white Queens high school\".[155] Additionally, Marvel made a conscious decision to mostly avoid including or referencing characters who appeared in previous Spider-Man films, outside of major ones like Peter and May Parker, and Flash Thompson. This included the Daily Bugle, with co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll saying, \"We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn't want to go down that road right away, and if we do do a Daily Bugle, we want to do it in a way that feels contemporary\".[114] This also included the character Mary Jane Watson, but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials \"MJ\" as a nod to that character. Feige said that the point of this is \"to have fun with [references] while at the same time having it be different characters that can provide a different dynamic\".[30]\n\nSpider-Man's costume in the film has more technical improvements than the previous suits, including the logo on the chest being a remote drone, an AI system similar to Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S., a holographic interface, a parachute, a tracking device for Stark to track Parker, a heater, an airbag, the ability to light up, and the ability to augment reality with the eyepieces. Stark also builds in a \"training wheels\" protocol, to initially limit Parker's access to all of its features. Carroll noted Marvel went through the comics and \"pull[ed] out all the sort of fun and wacky things the suit did\" to include in the Homecoming suit.[156] Spider-Man's web-shooters have various settings, first teased at the end of Civil War, which Carroll explained allowed him to \"adjust the spray\" to different settings like the spinning web, web ball, or ricochet web. He compared this to a DSLR camera.[114]\n\nPrincipal photography began on June 20, 2016,[157] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[158] under the working title Summer of George.[159] Salvatore Totino served as director of photography.[160] Filming also took place in Atlanta, with locations including Grady High School,[161] Downtown Atlanta,[162] the Atlanta Marriott Marquis,[163] Piedmont Park, the Georgia World Congress Center,[164] and the West End neighborhood.[165] Holland said building New York sets in Atlanta was cheaper than actually filming in New York, a location closely associated with the character, though the production may \"end up [in New York] for one week or two\".[166] A replica of the Staten Island Ferry was built in Atlanta, with the ability to open and close in half in 10 to 12 seconds and be flooded with 40,000 gallons of water in 8 seconds.[167] Additional filming also occurred at two magnet schools in the Van Nuys and Reseda neighborhoods of Los Angeles.[168]\n\nCasting continued after the start of production, with the inclusion of Isabella Amara, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Josie Totah,[80] Hannibal Buress,[72] Selenis Leyva,[77] Abraham Attah,[84] Michael Mando,[68] Tyne Daly,[48] Garcelle Beauvais, Tiffany Espensen,[62] and Angourie Rice in unspecified roles,[86] with Bokeem Woodbine joining as an additional villain.[47] At San Diego Comic-Con in 2016, Marvel confirmed the castings of Keaton, Zendaya, Glover, Harrier, Revolori, Daly, and Woodbine, while revealing Zendaya, Harrier, and Revolori's roles as Michelle, Liz Allan, and Flash Thompson, respectively,[26][36][43][169] and announcing the casting of Jacob Batalon as Ned.[36][37] It was also revealed that the Adrian Toomes / Vulture would be the film's villain, while the writing teams of Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, joined Goldstein and Daley in writing the screenplay,[36] from Goldstein and Daley's story. Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the Marvel One-Shot films, did uncredited work on the film as well.[170] Watts praised Goldstein and Daley's drafts as \"really fun and funny\", and said that they \"sort of established the broad strokes of the movie\", with him and Ford, close friends since childhood, then re-writing the script based on specific ideas that Watts had and things that he wanted to film, which he said was a \"pretty substantial structural pass, rearranging things and building it into the sort of story arc we wanted it to be.\" McKenna and Sommers then joined the film to deal with changes to the script during filming, as \"it's all a little bit flexible when you get to set. You try things out, and you just need someone to be writing while you're shooting.\"[134]\n\nHarrier noted that the young actors in the film \"constantly refer to ourselves as The Breakfast Club\".[26] Shortly after, Martha Kelly joined the cast in an unspecified role.[90] In August, Michael Chernus was cast as Phineas Mason / Tinkerer,[67] while Jona Xiao joined the cast in an unspecified role,[171] and Buress said he was playing a gym teacher.[73] By September 2016, Jon Favreau was reprising his role as Happy Hogan from the Iron Man series,[22] and filming concluded in Atlanta and moved to New York City. Locations in the latter city included Astoria, Queens; Sunnyside, Queens; St. George, Staten Island; Manhattan;[172][173][174][175] and Franklin K. Lane High School in Brooklyn.[114] Additionally, UFC fighter Tyron Woodley said he had been considered for a villain role in the film, but had to drop out due to a prior commitment with Fox Sports.[176] Principal photography wrapped on October 2, 2016, in New York City,[177] with some additional filming taking place later in the month in Berlin, Germany, near the Brandenburg Gate.[178]\n\nIn November 2016, Feige confirmed that Keaton would play Adrian Toomes / Vulture,[18][179] while Woodbine was revealed as Herman Schultz / Shocker.[21][180] In March 2017, Harrier said the film was undergoing re-shoots,[181] and Evans was set to appear as Steve Rogers / Captain America in an instructional fitness video.[61] Watts was inspired by The President's Fitness Challenge for this, feeling that Captain America would be the obvious version of that for the MCU. He then started brainstorming other public service announcements (PSA) starring Captain America, about \"just anything you could think of, we had poor Captain America do it\". Watts said that many of the additional PSA videos would be featured on the home media of the film.[182] According to Goldstein, additional videos featuring other Avengers were planned at some point.[183] Watts confirmed that the company Stark creates that leads Toomes on his villainous path in the film is Damage Control, which Watts felt \"just fit in with our overall philosophy with the kind of story we wanted to tell\" and created a lot of practical questions Watts wanted to use \"to drive the story\".[59]\n\nThe film features multiple post-credit scenes.[59][184] The first gives the Vulture a chance at redemption, showing him protect Parker from another villain. Watts said this \"was a really interesting thing in the development of the story. You couldn't just rely on the tropes of the villain being a murderer and killing a bunch of people. He had to be redeemable in some capacity in the end and that he believes everything he said, especially about his family.\" The second post-credits scene is an additional Captain America PSA, where he talks about the value of patience—a meta-referential joke at the expense of the audience, who have just waited through the film's credits to see the scene.[185] This was a \"last-minute addition\" to the film.[186] Watts completed work on Homecoming at the beginning of June 2017, approving the final visual effects shots. He stated that he had never been told that he could not do something by Marvel or Sony, saying, \"You assume you'll have to fight for every little weird thing you wanna do, but I didn't really ever run into that. I got to do kind of everything I wanted to.\"[134] That month, Starr explained that he was playing the academic decathlon coach at Parker's high school,[76] and Marshall-Green was said to be portraying another Shocker.[187]\n\nIn July, Feige discussed specific moments in the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige \"wanted to see in a movie for a long, long time\".[188] Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, \"We have [Parker] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem.\"[17] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man (2008) when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, \"What does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique.\"[189] Goldstein added that it \"diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [and] lets her become part of what's really his life.\"[17] Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, feeling that if it did not work, the film would not work. The team \"worked backwards and forwards from that moment ... You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [and it] doesn't seem like something out of left field\".[188] Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, \"more than anything else, [what] I was looking forward to, and I got to have a lot of fun shooting that stuff\".[185] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were \"giddy when we first came up with [that twist], because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time.\"[17]\n\nVisual effects for the film were completed by Sony Pictures Imageworks, Industrial Light & Magic, Luma Pictures, Digital Domain, Cantina Creative, Iloura, Trixter,[191] and Method Studios.[167] Executive producer Victoria Alonso initially did not want Imageworks, which worked on all previous Spider-Man films, to work on Homecoming, in order to give it a different look than those earlier films. She changed her mind after seeing what she called \"phenomenal\" test material from the vendor.[192] The film's main-on-end title sequence was designed by Perception.[193]\n\nTrixter contributed over 300 shots for the film, including the opening scene at Grand Central Terminal, the sequence that retells the events of Civil War from Parker's perspective, the sequence where Toomes takes Liz and Parker to the dance, the school battle between Parker and Schultz, and the scene around and within the Avengers compound. They also worked on both Spider-Man suits and the spider tracer. Trixter created additional salvage workers to populate the Grand Central scene, whose clothes and proportions were able to be altered to create variation. For the battle between Parker and Schultz, Trixter used an all-digital Spider-Man in his homemade suit, which came from Imageworks, with Trixter applying a rigging, muscle, and cloth system to it \"to mimic the appearance of the rather loose training suit\". They also created the effects for Schultz's gauntlets and had to change the setting from the Atlanta set to Queens, by using a CGI school and adding 360 degrees of matte paintings for the mid to far-distance elements. Trixter received concept art and basic geometry that was used previously for the Avengers compound, but ended up remodeling it for the way it appears in Homecoming. Models and textures for Spider-Man's Avengers costume were created by Framestore for use in a future MCU film, with Trixter creating the vault that it appears in. Trixter VFX supervisor Dominik Zimmerle said the idea was \"to have a clean, high tech, presentation Vault for the new suit. It should appear distinctively 'Stark' originated\".[190]\n\nDigital Domain worked on the Staten Island Ferry battle, creating the CGI versions of Spider-Man, the Vulture suit, Iron Man, and Spider-Man's drone. Digital Domain was able to LIDAR an actual Staten Island Ferry, as well as the version created on set, to help with creating their digital version.[167] Lou Pecora, visual effects supervisor at Digital Domain, called that sequence \"brutal\" because \"the way they were shot, it was lit to be a certain time of day, and afterwards it was decided to change that time of day.\"[194] Sony Pictures Imageworks created much of the third act of the film when Parker confronts Toomes on the plane and beach in his homemade suit, and Toomes is in an upgraded Vulture suit. Some elements of Vulture's first suit were shared with Imageworks, but the remainder were created by them \"based on a maquette\". For the plane's cloaking ability, Imageworks was inspired by Adaptiv IR Camouflage tank cloaking system by BAE Systems, which \"uses a series of titles to cloak against infrared\". For their web design, which was based on the one created for Civil War, Digital Domain referenced polar bear hair because of its translucent nature. Imageworks also looked to the Civil War webs, as well as to those they had created for previous Spider-Man films, in which \"the web[s] had [...] tiny barbs that aided in hooking on to things.\" For this film, they \"dialed back the barbs\" to line up more closely with the other web designs created for this film.[167] Method Studios worked on the Washington Monument sequence.[192] Iron Man's armor in the film, the Mark XLVII, is a recolored version of the MK XLVI armor introduced in Civil War; this was done because Sony did not have the budget to create a new Iron Man suit. Feige requested the color scheme resemble the Ultimate Iron Man armor from the comics.[195]\n\nWhile promoting Doctor Strange in early November 2016, Feige accidentally revealed that Michael Giacchino, who composed the music for that film, would compose the score for Homecoming as well. Giacchino soon confirmed this himself.[196] Recording for the soundtrack began on April 11, 2017.[197] The score includes the theme from the 1960s animated series.[198] The soundtrack was released by Sony Masterworks on July 7, 2017.[199]\n\nWatts, Holland, Batalon, Harrier, Revolori, and Zendaya appeared at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con to show an exclusive clip of the film,[36][200] which also had a panel at Comic Con Experience 2016.[201] The first trailer for Homecoming premiered on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on December 8, 2016,[202] and was released online alongside an international version, which Feige thought was different enough that \"it would be fun for people to see both.\"[18] The shots of Vulture descending through a hotel atrium and Spider-Man swinging with Iron Man flying beside him were created specifically for the trailer. Watts explained that the Vulture shot was created for Comic-Con and \"was never meant to be in the movie\", but he was able to repurpose the angle for Vulture's reveal in the film. The Spider-Man and Iron Man shot was created because the marketing team wanted a shot of the two together, and existing shots \"just didn't look that great\" then. The trailer shot used a background plate taken when filming the subway in Queens.[115] The two trailers were viewed over 266 million times globally within a week.[103]\n\nOn March 28, 2017, a second trailer debuted after screening at CinemaCon 2017 the night before.[203] Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com, noted that the new Justice League trailer had received more Twitter mentions in that week but there was \"clearer enthusiasm for Spider-Man\". The Homecoming trailer was second for the week of March 20–26 in new conversations (85,859) behind Justice League (201,267), according to comScore's PreAct service, which is \"a tracking service utilizing social data to create context of the ever-evolving role of digital communication on feature films\".[204] An exclusive clip from the film was seen during the 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards.[205] On May 24, Sony and Marvel released a third domestic and international trailer.[206] Ethan Anderton of /Film enjoyed both trailers, stating Homecoming \"has the potential to be the best Spider-Man movie yet. Having the webslinger as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe just feels right\".[207] TechCrunch's Darrell Etherington agreed, saying, \"You may have feelings about a tech-heavy Spider-Man suit or other aspects of this interpretation of the character, but it's still shaping up to be better than any Spider-Man depicted in movies in recent memory.\"[208] Ana Dumaraog for Screen Rant said the second trailer \"arguably showed too much of the movie's overarching narrative\", but the third \"perfectly shows the right amount of new and old footage\". She also appreciated the attention to detail that Watts and the writers put into the film, as highlighted by the trailers.[209] Siddhant Adlakha of Birth.Movies.Death also felt the trailers were giving away too many details,[210] but enjoyed them overall, especially the \"vlogging\" aspect.[211] Collider's Dave Trombore expressed similar sentiments to Adlakha.[212] After the release of the trailers, comScore and its PreAct service noted Homecoming was the top film for new social media conversations, that week and the week of May 29.[213][214]\n\nAlongside the release of the third trailers were domestic and international release posters.[206] The domestic poster was criticized for its \"floating head\" style,[210][215] which offers \"a chaotic mess of people looking in different directions, with little sense of what the film will deliver\".[215] Dan Auty for GameSpot called it a \"star studded hot mess\",[215] while Vanity Fair's Katey Rich felt the poster was \"too bogged down by the many different threads of the Marvel universe to highlight anything that's made Spider-Man: Homecoming seem special so far\".[216] Adlakha felt the posters released for the film \"have been alright thus far, but these ones probably tell general audiences to expect a very bloated movie\". Adlakha was more positive of the international poster, which he felt was more \"comicbook-y\" and \"looks like it could be an actual scene from the film\".[210] Both Rich and Adlakha criticized the fact that Holland, Keaton, and Downey appeared twice on the domestic poster, both in and out of costume.[210][216] Sony partnered with ESPN CreativeWorks to create cross-promotional television ads for Homecoming and the 2017 NBA Finals, which were filmed by Watts. The ads were made to \"weave in a highlight from the game just moments\" after it occurred.[217] The promos see Holland, Downey Jr., and Favreau reprise their roles from the film, with cameo appearances from Stan Lee, DJ Khaled, Tim Duncan, Magic Johnson, and Cari Champion.[103] Through June and July 2017, a Homecoming-inspired cafe opened in the Roppongi Hills complex in Tokyo, offering \"arachnid-themed foods and drinks, including a Spider Curry, Spider-Sense Latte and a sweet and refreshing Strawberry Spider Squash drink\", as well as a free, limited-edition sticker with any purchase.[218]\n\nFor the week ending on June 11, comScore and its PreAct service noted that new social media conversations for the film were second only to Black Panther and its new trailer;[219] Homecoming was then the number one film in the next two weeks.[220][221] That month, Sony released a mobile app allowing users to \"access\" Parker's phone and \"view his photos, videos, text messages, and hear voicemails from his friends\". The app also provided an \"AR Suit Explorer\" to learn more about the technology in the Spider-Man suit, and use photo filters, GIFs, and stickers of the character.[222] Sony and Dave & Buster's also announced an arcade game based on the film, playable exclusively at Dave & Buster's locations.[223] A tie-in comic, Spider-Man: Homecoming Prelude, was released on June 20, collecting two prelude issues.[224] On June 28, in partnership with Thinkmodo, a promotional prank was released in which Spider-Man (stuntman Chris Silcox) dropped from the ceiling in a coffee shop to scare customers; the video also featured a cameo appearance from Lee.[225] Sony also partnered with the mobile app Holo to let users add 3D holograms of Spider-Man, with Holland's voice and lines from the film, to real-world photos and videos.[226] Before the end of June, Spider-Man: Homecoming—Virtual Reality Experience was released on the PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive for free, produced by Sony Pictures VR and developed by CreateVR. It allows users to experience how it feels to be Spider-Man, with the ability to hit targets with his web-shooters and face off against the Vulture. It was also available at select Cinemark Theatres in the United States and at the CineEurope trade show in Barcelona.[227]\n\nAhead of the film's release, for the week ending on July 2, the film was the top film for the third consecutive week for new social media conversations, according to comScore, which also noted that Spider-Man: Homecoming had produced a total of 2.67 million conversations to date.[228] Other promotions included Audi and Dell (both also had product placement in the film), Pizza Hut, General Mills, Synchrony Bank, MovieTickets.com, Goodwill, Baskin-Robbins, Dunkin' Donuts, Danone Waters, Panasonic Batteries, M&M's, Mondelez, Asus, Bimbo, Jetstar, KEF, Kellogg's, Lieferheld, PepsiCo, Plus, Roady, Snickers, Sony Mobile, Oppo, Optus, and Doritos. Watts directed a commercial for Dell's marketing efforts as well, which earned 2.8 million views online. Goodwill hosted a build-your-own Spider-Man suit contest, with the winner attending the film's premiere. Overall, the campaign generated over $140 million in media value, greater than those for all previous Spider-Man films and Marvel Studios' first 2017 release, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. This does not include merchandising for the film, which is controlled by Marvel and Disney.[229] Marketing of the film in China included partnering with Momo, iQiyi, Tencent QQ, Baidu, Mizone, CapitaLand, Xiaomi, HTC, and corporate parent Sony.[230][231] To help target the teenage audience, Holland \"recorded a high school entrance exam greeting\" while The Rap of China contestant PG One recorded a theme song.[230]\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming held its world premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 28, 2017,[232] and was released in the United Kingdom on July 5.[233] It opened in additional international markets on July 6,[234] with 23,400 screens (277 of which were IMAX) in 56 markets for its opening weekend.[235] The film was released in the United States on July 7,[136] in 4,348 theaters (392 were IMAX and IMAX 3D, and 601 were premium large-format),[10][137][236] including 3D screenings.[10] It was originally slated for release on July 28.[136] Spider-Man: Homecoming is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[237]\n\nIn March 2024, Sony announced that all of their live-action Spider-Man films would be re-released in theaters as part of Columbia Pictures' 100th anniversary celebration. Spider-Man: Homecoming was re-released on May 20, 2024.[238]\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming was released on digital download by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on September 26, 2017, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Ultra HD Blu-ray, and DVD on October 17, 2017. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[239] The physical releases in its first week of sale were the top home media release, according to NPD VideoScan data. The Blu-ray version accounted for 79% of the sales, with 13% of total sales coming from the Ultra HD Blu-ray version.[240]\n\nIn April 2021, Sony signed a deal with Disney giving them access to their legacy content, including past Spider-Man films and Marvel content in Sony's Spider-Man Universe, to stream on Disney+ and Hulu and appear on Disney's linear television networks. Disney's access to Sony's titles would come following their availability on Netflix. Homecoming had previously been available on Starz and FX.[241][242] The film became available on Disney+ in the United Kingdom and Australia on June 17, 2022,[243][244] and became available in the United States on May 12, 2023.[245]\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming grossed over $334.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $546 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $880.2 million.[3] The film had the second-biggest global IMAX opening for a Sony film with $18 million.[235] In May 2017, a survey from Fandango indicated that Homecoming was the second-most-anticipated summer blockbuster behind Wonder Woman.[246] By September 24, 2017, the film had earned $874.4 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing superhero film of 2017, and the sixth-largest film based on a Marvel character.[247] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $200.1 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it seventh on their list of 2017's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[248]\n\nThe film earned $50.9 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada (including $15.4 million from Thursday night previews),[103] and had a total weekend gross of $117 million, the top film for the weekend.[249] It was the second-highest opening for both a Spider-Man film and a Sony film, after Spider-Man 3's $151.1 million debut in 2007.[103] Early projections for the film from BoxOffice had it earning $135 million in its opening weekend,[250] which was later adjusted to $125 million,[251] and Deadline Hollywood noting industry projections at anywhere between $90–120 million.[236] In its second weekend, the film fell to second behind War for the Planet of the Apes with $44.2 million, a 62% decline in earnings, which was similar to the declines The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3 had in their second weekends. Additionally, Homecoming's domestic gross reached $208.3 million, which surpassed the total domestic gross of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 ($202.9 million).[252] The film fell to third in its third weekend.[253] By July 26, Homecoming's domestic gross reached $262.1 million, surpassing the total domestic gross of The Amazing Spider-Man ($262 million),[254] leading to a fifth-place finish for its fourth weekend.[255] The next weekend, Homecoming finished sixth,[256] and finished seventh the following five weekends.[257][258][259][260][261] By September 3, 2017, the film had earned $325.1 million,[260] surpassing the $325 million projected amount for its total domestic gross.[250] In its eleventh weekend, Homecoming finished ninth.[262]\n\nOutside of the United States and Canada, Spider-Man: Homecoming earned $140.5 million its opening weekend from the 56 markets it opened in, with the film becoming number one in 50 of them. The $140.5 million was the highest opening ever for a Spider-Man film.[235] South Korea had the highest Wednesday opening day gross,[263] which contributed to a $25.4 million five-day opening in the country, the third-highest opening ever for a Hollywood film.[235] Brazil had the largest July opening day of all time, with $2 million,[263] leading to an opening weekend total of $8.9 million. The $7 million earned from IMAX showings was the top opening of all time for a Sony film internationally.[235] In its second weekend, the film opened in France at number one and number two in Germany. It earned an additional $11.9 million in South Korea, to bring its total in the country to $42.2 million. This made Homecoming the highest-grossing Spider-Man film and the top-grossing Hollywood film of 2017 in the country. Brazil contributed an additional $5.7 million, for a total of $19.4 million from the country, which was also the largest gross from a Spider-Man film.[264] The film's third weekend saw the Latin America region set a record as the highest-grossing Spider-Man film of all time, with a region total of $77.4 million. Brazil remained the top-grossing market for the region, with $25.7 million. In South Korea, the film became the 10th-highest-grossing international release of all time.[265] Homecoming opened at number one in Spain in its fourth weekend.[266] In its sixth weekend, the film opened at number one in Japan, with its $770,000 from IMAX the fourth-largest IMAX weekend for a Marvel film in the country.[267] The film opened at number one in China on September 8, 2017, grossing $23 million on its opening day, including Thursday previews, making it the third biggest opening day for a Marvel Cinematic Universe film, behind Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War, and the largest opening day gross for a Sony film in the country.[230] The $70.8 million Homecoming earned in China for its opening weekend was the third-highest opening behind Age of Ultron and Civil War, with $6 million from IMAX, which was the best IMAX opening weekend in September, and the best IMAX opening weekend for a Sony film.[231] As of September 24, 2017[update], the film's largest markets were China ($115.7 million),[247] South Korea ($51.4 million), and the United Kingdom ($34.8 million).[268]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 92%, with an average score of 7.6/10, based on 400 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Spider-Man: Homecoming does whatever a second reboot can, delivering a colorful, fun adventure that fits snugly in the sprawling MCU without getting bogged down in franchise-building.\"[269] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[270] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 89% overall positive score and a 74% \"definite recommend\".[103]\n\nMike Ryan at Uproxx felt Homecoming was the best Spider-Man film yet, specifically praising the light tone, younger and more optimistic portrayal of Parker, and Keaton's performance—Ryan named the Vulture twist reveal as one of his favorite scenes in the MCU. He said Homecoming is \"the kind of movie you leave and you're just in the best mood—and still will be days later.\"[271] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film unique and refreshing, praising its lower stakes and focus on the character's school life. He praised Holland as \"terrific and well-cast\", as well as the other cast members; Roeper believed that Keaton's performance is more interesting than the character otherwise could have been.[272] Owen Gleiberman of Variety felt the film was \"just distinctive enough\" from the previous Spider-Man films to become a \"sizable hit\", and highlighted its focus on making Peter Parker a realistically youthful and grounded character. He found Holland to be likable in the role and thought the Vulture twist was a positive direction for that character. He did criticize the vague take on Spider-Man's origin and powers, but \"the flying action has a casual flip buoyancy, and the movie does get you rooting for Peter.\"[1] At IndieWire, David Ehrlich criticized the film's superhero genre clichés and underwritten female characters, but praised the elements of the film that leaned into Parker's high school life and the humanity of the Vulture.[273]\n\nKenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a mixed review, criticizing the \"juvenile\" depiction of Parker and Watts' \"unevenly orchestrated\" direction, but feeling that the film \"finds its pace and rhythm by the end\" and praising Keaton's performance.[274] The Hollywood Reporter's John DeFore found the film to be \"occasionally exciting but often frustrating\", and suggested it might have worked better if less focus had been put on integrating the film with the MCU. DeFore did praise Holland's performance as \"winning\" despite the script and called Zendaya a scene-stealer.[275] Mick LaSalle, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, said the film was a \"pretty good Spider-Man movie\" that \"breaks no new ground\", not exploring the human side of the character enough and instead focusing on action that is not thrilling.[276] At The Telegraph, Robbie Collin argued that \"a little of the new Spider-Man went an exhilaratingly long way in Captain America: Civil War last year. But a lot of him goes almost nowhere in this slack and spiritless solo escapade.\" Collin criticized Watts's direction but was positive of the cast, including Holland, Keaton, Tomei, and Zendaya.[277]\n\nA sequel, Spider-Man: Far From Home, was released on July 2, 2019.[283][284] Watts returned to direct,[285] from a script by McKenna and Sommers.[286] Holland, Favreau, Zendaya, Tomei, and Batalon reprise their roles,[287][288] with Jake Gyllenhaal joining as Mysterio.[289] Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders also reprised their roles as Nick Fury and Maria Hill, respectively, from previous MCU media.[290]\n\nA third film was announced by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures in September 2019, after an impasse between the two companies was resolved during negotiations.[291] Watts returned to direct,[292] from a script by McKenna and Sommers.[293] Holland, Zendaya, Favreau, Tomei, Batalon,[294] and Revolori reprise their roles,[292] while Benedict Cumberbatch and Benedict Wong reprise their MCU roles as Doctor Strange and Wong.[295][294] Actors reprising their roles from previous Spider-Man films include Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield returning as their versions of Spider-Man from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy and Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films, respectively,[296] alongside Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus, and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko / Sandman from Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, along with Rhys Ifans as Curt Connors / Lizard and Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon / Electro from Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films.[297] Spider-Man: No Way Home was released on December 17, 2021.[298]\n\nIn November 2021, Pascal revealed that Sony and Marvel Studios were planning on making at least three more Spider-Man films starring Holland, with work on the first of those films getting ready to begin.[299]\n"

        "title": "Thor: Ragnarok",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor:_Ragnarok",
        "content": "\n\nThor: Ragnarok is a 2017 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Thor, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to Thor (2011) and Thor: The Dark World (2013), and is the 17th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Taika Waititi from a screenplay by Eric Pearson and the writing team of Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost, and stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor alongside Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, Idris Elba, Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson, Karl Urban, Mark Ruffalo, and Anthony Hopkins. In Thor: Ragnarok, Thor must escape the alien planet Sakaar in time to save Asgard from Hela (Blanchett) and the impending Ragnarök.\n\nA third Thor film was confirmed in January 2014, when Kyle and Yost began work on the screenplay. The involvement of Hemsworth and Hiddleston was announced that October, and the film's title was revealed to be Thor: Ragnarok later that month. Waititi joined the film as director a year later, after Thor: The Dark World director Alan Taylor chose not to return. Ruffalo joined the cast reprising the role of Bruce Banner / Hulk from previous MCU films, which allowed elements of the 2006 comic storyline \"Planet Hulk\" to be adapted for Ragnarok. The rest of the cast, including Blanchett as Hela, was confirmed in May 2016, with Pearson's involvement revealed at the start of filming that July. Principal photography took place in Brisbane and Sydney, Australia, with the film also having exclusive use of Village Roadshow Studios in Oxenford, concluding in October 2016.\n\nThor: Ragnarok premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on October 10, 2017, and was released in the United States on November 3, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its acting and Waititi's direction, as well as the action sequences, visual effects, musical score, and humor, with many critics considering it to be the best installment of the Thor franchise. It grossed $855 million, becoming the highest-grossing film of the series and the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2017. A sequel, Thor: Love and Thunder, was released in July 2022.\n\nTwo years after the Battle of Sokovia,[a] Thor is imprisoned by the fire demon Surtur, who reveals that Thor's father Odin is no longer on Asgard. He explains that the realm will soon be destroyed during the prophesied apocalypse Ragnarök, once Surtur unites his crown with the Eternal Flame that burns in Odin's vault. Thor frees himself, defeats Surtur, and takes his crown, believing he has prevented Ragnarök. Thor returns to Asgard to find Heimdall gone and his estranged brother Loki posing as Odin. He forces Loki to help find their father, who Loki put a spell on after his presumed sacrifice years before.\n\nWith directions from Stephen Strange, they find Odin in Norway. Unpossessed, Odin explains that he is dying, Ragnarök is imminent despite Thor's efforts, and his death will free his firstborn child, Hela, from Hel, a prison she was sealed in long ago. Hela, a sibling Thor and Loki did not know existed, was the leader of Asgard's armies and conquered the Nine Realms with Odin, but he imprisoned her and wrote her out of history after she became too bloodthirsty and did not share his views on peace.\n\nOdin dies and Hela appears, destroying Thor's hammer Mjolnir. She pursues the two as they attempt to flee through the Bifröst Bridge, knocking them out into space. Arriving in Asgard, Hela defeats its army, slays the Warriors Three, and resurrects the ancient dead who once fought with her, including her giant wolf Fenris. She appoints the Asgardian Skurge as her executioner. Hela plans to use the Bifröst to expand Asgard's empire, but Heimdall takes the sword that controls the Bifröst.\n\nMeanwhile, Thor crash-lands on Sakaar, a garbage planet surrounded by wormholes. A slave trader designated Scrapper 142 subdues him with an obedience disk and sells him as a gladiator to Sakaar's ruler, the Grandmaster, with whom Loki has already ingratiated himself. Thor recognizes 142 as a Valkyrie, one of a legendary force of female warriors who were killed fighting Hela eons ago. Thor is forced to compete in the Grandmaster's Contest of Champions, facing his friend Hulk. Summoning lightning, Thor gets the upper hand, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. Still enslaved after the fight, Thor attempts to convince Hulk and 142 to help him save Asgard, but neither is willing.\n\nThor finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar. A recording of Natasha Romanoff causes Hulk to transform back into Bruce Banner for the first time since leaving Sokovia. 142 decides to help Thor save Asgard. Loki helps them steal one of the Grandmaster's ships. They liberate the other gladiators who, incited by two aliens named Korg and Miek, stage a revolution. Loki again attempts to betray his brother, but Thor anticipates this and incapacitates him. Thor, Banner, and 142 escape through a wormhole to Asgard, where Hela's forces attack Heimdall and the Asgardian citizens. Hulk defeats Fenris; Loki and the gladiators arrive to help, and a repentant Skurge sacrifices himself to save the citizens.\n\nThor, battling Hela, loses his right eye and has a vision of Odin that helps him realize only Ragnarök can stop her, as she is too powerful. He sends Loki to trigger Ragnarök by placing Surtur's crown in the Eternal Flame. Surtur is reborn and destroys Asgard, killing Hela. Aboard the Grandmaster's spaceship, the Statesman, Thor, now king, reconciles with Loki and decides to take his people to Earth. In a mid-credits scene, they are intercepted by a large spacecraft.[b] In a post-credits scene, the overthrown Grandmaster is confronted by his former subjects.\n\nAdditionally, Tadanobu Asano, Ray Stevenson, and Zachary Levi reprise their roles as Hogun, Volstagg, and Fandral, respectively, members of the Warriors Three.[23][41] Feige called their appearances \"noble ends\" that served to establish the threat of Hela and the danger she poses to the main characters.[42] Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Dr. Stephen Strange from the film Doctor Strange (2016) on a brief appearance.[43] Rachel House, who has appeared in several of Waititi's films, plays Topaz, the Grandmaster's chief enforcer,[20][44] while Waititi portrays Korg, a Kronan gladiator who befriends Thor. Waititi provided a motion-capture performance for the character, who is made of rocks, and wanted to do something different by having the character be soft-spoken,[45][46] ultimately basing Korg's voice on that of Polynesian bouncers, as well as his friend and frequent co-star, Rhys Darby.[47][48] Waititi also provided the motion-capture performance for the fire demon Surtur, based on the mythological being Surtr, with Clancy Brown voicing the character.[49] Thor and Hulk co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance as a man on Sakaar who cuts Thor's hair.[50] There are also several cameos in a sequence where Asgardian actors perform a play based on the events of The Dark World: Sam Neill, with whom Waititi previously worked on Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016), plays the Odin actor;[51][52] Luke Hemsworth, brother of Chris, plays the Thor actor; Matt Damon plays the Loki actor;[52] and Charlotte Nicdao plays the Sif actress.[53] Scarlett Johansson appears as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow through archival footage from Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015).[54]\n\nWhile promoting the release of Thor: The Dark World in October 2013, Chris Hemsworth expressed willingness to portray Thor for as long as \"people wanted more\", adding that he was contracted for another Thor film and two more Avengers films.[55] Producer Kevin Feige stated that the next Thor would build from elements at the end of The Dark World.[56] In January 2014, Marvel announced that Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost would write the screenplay for a third film, with Feige again producing;[57] the story was being outlined that July.[58] At the end of October 2014, Feige announced that the film would be titled Thor: Ragnarok, with a scheduled release date of July 28, 2017. Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston were set to return as Thor and Loki, respectively.[3][10] Hemsworth earned $15 million for the film.[59] Feige added that the film would be \"very important\" in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU),[60] and also confirmed that, in the context of the film, the word Ragnarok means \"the end of all things\".[61] He felt that \"people will [not] read into that title alone what the movie's going to be.\"[62]\n\nIn February 2015, Marvel pushed back the release date to November 3, 2017.[63] That April, Feige was expecting a draft for the film soon,[64] and a month later he stated that a director, additional screenwriter, and further casting announcements would be revealed \"towards the end of the summer\",[65] with filming set for June 2016.[66] The Dark World director Alan Taylor explained that he would not be returning, as \"the Marvel experience was particularly wrenching because I was sort of given absolute freedom while we were shooting, and then in [post-production] it turned into a different movie. So, that is something I hope never to repeat and don't wish upon anybody else.\"[67] During the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con, Jaimie Alexander said that she would reprise her role as Sif in \"a very pivotal part\" of the film.[68][69]\n\nI think the overall sense that I'm trying to give to the audience and what I want the audience to leave the cinema carrying with them is a sense of joy really... Sometimes I would stop and think, I'm doing a movie that's got Thor and Doctor Strange and the Incredible Hulk and Loki and every character is so strange and different... Civil War it's just humans, humans with human problems. Ours is creatures and beings and all these sorts of really different characters.\n\nBy October 2015, Taika Waititi had entered negotiations to direct Ragnarok. Other directors under consideration included Ruben Fleischer, Rob Letterman, and Rawson Marshall Thurber.[71] Elizabeth Banks had expressed interest in presenting a pitch for the film, but never ultimately met with Marvel to do so.[72] Marvel presented the prospective directors with \"the ten different ideas that we had for the movie\", asking them all to come back with a clearer picture of what the film should be.[73] Waititi created \"a sizzle reel for the tone, and some joke stuff\" using clips from other films,[73][74] including Big Trouble in Little China (1986).[75] Despite being a discouraged practice within the company, Marvel considered Waititi's reel to be \"amazing\",[73] particularly its use of Led Zeppelin's \"Immigrant Song\" for the score,[76] which Feige felt \"defined what Taika was going to do with this\". The song was later used in the film itself, and for marketing it.[76] On why he decided to pursue directing the film, after stating in 2012 that he had no interest in \"big features, where the art of the project was sacrificed for profit\", Waititi said he felt \"like a guest in Marvel's universe but with the creative freedom to do what I want\".[77] Waititi was confirmed as director of the film by multiple news outlets later in October.[78][79][80]\n\nIn the same month, Mark Ruffalo was also finalizing a deal to reprise his role as Bruce Banner / Hulk from previous MCU films,[36] which was confirmed shortly after.[81] Hulk was last seen at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) traveling in a Quinjet, which was originally planned to be shown flying near Saturn. Feige explained that this was changed to an Earth-based location to leave Hulk's fate ambiguous and dispel rumors that a film based on the 2006 comic storyline \"Planet Hulk\" was in development, since Marvel Studios had no plans to adapt the storyline at the time.[82] According to executive producer Brad Winderbaum, the idea to include Hulk in Ragnarok came early on in development, when the production team looked at the \"Planet Hulk\" storyline and felt it was a \"no brainer\" to integrate Hulk into the Thor franchise, exploring \"the idea of a planet where there's gladiatorial games as a Thor predicament. [That storyline] was a really cool idea to us.\"[83] Feige further explained that initial discussions had focused on doing \"something totally different with Thor\", and that centered on continuing the relationship with Loki and ideas for Hela, Valkyrie, Balder the Brave, and Beta Ray Bill, \"but we were like, 'We need something big.'\" This turned to discussing Thor going to space, and jokingly calling it \"Planet Thor\", which led to including Hulk in the film and revealing that he ultimately went to space at the end of Age of Ultron.[82]\n\nAlso in October, Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop announced that filming would take place in the country,[84] exclusively throughout the state of Queensland, including at Village Roadshow Studios in Oxenford, Gold Coast. According to Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, the production was to spend over $100 million in Queensland and employ 750 Queenslanders.[85] Hemsworth had asked Marvel to produce the film in his home country of Australia.[86] At the end of November 2015, Stellan Skarsgård, who portrayed Erik Selvig in the previous Thor films, said that he was contracted to appear should Marvel want to include him, but he was uncertain at the time if they did.[87] He later confirmed that he would not appear in Ragnarok.[88] The next month, Stephany Folsom was hired to work on the script, and Cate Blanchett entered final negotiations to join the cast.[15][89]\n\nIn January 2016, with the film beginning pre-production,[85][90] Ruffalo described it as a \"road movie\" and indicated that additional filming would take place in Sydney.[91] Waititi stated that he was working on the script \"a little bit\", mainly adding humor to the screenplay,[92] with Eric Pearson joining the project to rewrite the screenplay. Pearson felt joining presented many challenges, as \"there were so many puzzle pieces already there,\" such as having Blanchett as Hela,[93] who was confirmed in the role a month later,[94] and including Hulk, Valkyrie, and Skurge, that he was asked to assemble. Pearson was told not to be restrained by anything from the previous films, and Waititi asked him to make the film fun and have Thor \"be the coolest character.\"[93] Alexander said in early March that she was no longer sure if she would appear in the film, due to scheduling conflicts with her television series Blindspot (2015–2020).[95] She later indicated that this may not be the case,[25][96] but ultimately was unable to appear in the film due to the conflict.[97][98] Sif does appear as a character in the play based on the events of The Dark World, portrayed by Charlotte Nicdao.[53]\n\nIn April, Tessa Thompson was cast as Valkyrie,[11][34] with Natalie Portman not returning from the previous films as love interest Jane Foster.[99][100] Marvel never asked the screenwriters to include the Earth-based characters from the previous films,[101] and Feige said that Foster and Thor have broken up between films.[31] In May, Marvel confirmed Blanchett and Thompson for the film, announced the casting of Jeff Goldblum as Grandmaster and Karl Urban as Skurge, and revealed that Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins would reprise their respective roles of Heimdall and Odin from the previous films.[11] In early June, Palaszczuk and Marvel Studios executive David Grant announced that filming would begin on July 4, 2016,[102] with Weta Workshop creating props for the film.[35] Before the sets for Marvel's Doctor Strange (2016) were demolished, Waititi wrote and filmed a scene for Ragnarok where Thor meets Benedict Cumberbatch's Stephen Strange. Marvel and Doctor Strange director Scott Derrickson felt the scene was \"kind of perfect\" to show Strange joining the wider MCU, so the scene also appears during the credits of Doctor Strange.[43][103][104]\n\nFeige noted that Ragnarok would primarily take place in the \"cosmos\" rather than on Earth, a departure from the previous Thor films.[62][105] He expanded by saying, \"Tonally and geographically there are a lot of different planets outside of the nine realms that we visit\" in the film.[99] Waititi consulted with theoretical physicist Clifford Johnson on space travel. Johnson viewed early drafts of the script, and gave Waititi physics ideas that could \"wink at some of the classic old [Thor] stuff\"; Johnson previously consulted on the second season of the MCU television series Agent Carter (2015–2016).[106] Astronomer-physicist Adam Frank was also a consultant on the film, advising on wormholes and interstellar travel.[107] Comic artist and Thor co-creator Jack Kirby was one of Waititi's major visual inspirations for the film.[108] Winderbaum also called Walt Simonson's \"Ragnarok\" story arc an inspiration for \"really fun elements ... both stylistically and narratively\", as well as Thor: God of Thunder by Jason Aaron, which was the inspiration for Hela's design and abilities.[21] Waititi said the planet Sakaar, which is featured in the \"Planet Hulk\" storyline, was \"the biggest shift for the film and these characters\",[108] with Winderbaum describing it as \"the toilet of the universe\", surrounded by \"wormholes that have been spitting things out into this place for eons\".[83] Also featured is Muspelheim, one of the Nine Realms, ruled by Surtur. Production designer Dan Hennah described it as a Dyson sphere, with the realm drawing power out of a dying star to energize its inhabitants.[109] Hennah hoped to give Asgard \"more of a humanity\" than in previous films, by adding smaller building perspectives to help the realm seem more practical and utilitarian. For Saakar's gladiator arena, Hennah looked at Roman gladiators, but differentiated from previous similar ideas by going \"all alien with it\". The arena is surrounded by \"standing up bleachers\".[110]\n\nWaititi said that the film would reinvent the franchise, as \"a lot of what we're doing with the film is, in a way, kind of dismantling and destroying the old idea and rebuilding it in a new way that's fresh. Everyone's got a slightly new take on their characters, so in that way, it feels like [this is] the first Thor (2011).\"[8] He added that he had seen the other films and respected them, but wanted to focus on making a \"standalone film because this could be the only time I do this. I just want to make it [my] version of a Marvel film in the best way possible.\"[9] This is something Hemsworth had hoped for, looking to have a lighter tone in Ragnarok compared to the previous Thor films, especially the second one, similar to Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). He said, \"I feel we had less of the sort of the naivety or fun or humor that the first [Thor] might have had. I wish we had more of that in the second [movie] ... We've done regal. We've done Shakespeare, and we've shown that. I think now it's time to go, 'Ok, cool. Let's try something different.'\"[111] Hemsworth continued that in order to prevent the character or film from becoming \"predictable\", there was \"definitely a goal to do something unexpected...I think we want to get back to more of a sense of adventure and fun\".[112]\n\nThe events of Ragnarok are set four years after the events of The Dark World, two years after the events of Age of Ultron,[3][113] and around the same time as the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016) and Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), with Winderbaum noting that \"things happen on top of each other now in Phase Three.\"[5] The events of Ragnarok also set up Avengers: Infinity War (2018),[8] and Hemsworth spoke to Infinity War directors Anthony and Joe Russo before receiving the script for Ragnarok to see how it would link to Infinity War. He said Ragnarok \"definitely bleeds nicely into those [films]\",[5] and Winderbaum likened Ragnarok's impact on the larger MCU to that of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), saying it would break down ideas regarding Asgard that were previously established similar \"to how Winter Soldier broke down S.H.I.E.L.D.\"[5]\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 4, 2016,[102][114] under the working title Creature Report,[115][116] at Village Roadshow Studios in Oxenford, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia,[85] exclusively using all nine of the studios' sound stages.[117] Additional filming was to occur throughout the state of Queensland,[85] including Tamborine National Park.[23] The Brisbane central business district, where filming took place from August 22 to 25,[26][115][118] was used to double as New York City.[119] Javier Aguirresarobe served as cinematographer on the film,[114][120] describing his work on the film as \"a rare combination of satisfaction and frustration\", feeling that he was mostly there to service the director and visual effects supervisor, but felt \"very happy to have been able to respond to such incredible technical requirements\".[121]\n\nLater in July, regarding the film's \"buddy-style comedy\" nature, Waititi said that the script had changed from then and it was still unclear what the final film would look like, but there \"are buddy elements to it between Thor and the Hulk\".[77] He said it would be a \"'70s/'80s sci-fi fantasy\" and \"the most 'out there' of all the Marvel movies\",[122] with the tone closest to that of Big Trouble in Little China.[75] Inspiration for the road-trip aspect of the film included 48 Hrs. (1982), Withnail and I (1987), and Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987).[8] Waititi also asked the heads of each department to watch Flash Gordon (1980) before beginning work.[123] Concept art released at San Diego Comic Con in 2016 revealed that the character Fenris Wolf would appear.[124][125]\n\nBy August, over 100 set and construction workers were given termination notifications, with some complaining that they had been promised work until October or November 2016, and that New Zealand crew members were receiving preferential treatment over the Australian locals. However, Premier Palaszczuk stated that the work for set builders simply \"finished\", and that other jobs would become available as actors arrived for filming.[126] Sets constructed for the film were for Sakaar, including the Grandmaster's palace and surrounding junkyard, as well as Asgard (based on the aesthetics of the previous Thor films).[23] The interior of the Avenger Quinjet, which was built for The Avengers (2012), was shipped to Australia.[116] Waititi, who is Māori, made hiring Indigenous and Aboriginal Australians, along with New Zealanders, a priority for the various departments, saying, \"It's a responsibility you have to the Indigenous people. You're coming to a country and you're bringing money into the economy and creating jobs but I think you have an even bigger responsibility to look after the people that have less opportunities.\" He added that having these people on the crew \"feel[s] very much like family\" and \"helps calm me down and makes me feel relaxed\". The Indigenous and Aboriginals were hired as part of an initiative by Screen Australia's Indigenous Department, whose mission is \"to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders a foot in the door of the film industry\".[127]\n\nIn mid-September 2016, concept art seen during a set visit indicated Midgard Serpent would appear,[128] and that Sif and the Warriors Three, allies of Thor in the previous two films, would be addressed in Ragnarok.[33] Towards the end of the month, Sam Neill, who worked with Waititi in Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016), revealed he had a role in the film.[51] Shortly after, Waititi teased the inclusion of the characters Korg,[129] who Waititi portrays through motion-capture,[45] and Miek,[130] who is not portrayed by an actor as he does not speak in the film, and is depicted as \"a larva-like creature... [with] cybernetic legs and arms\".[45] In mid-October, Waititi revealed that new camera technology had been used for a shot in the film, and that he had hoped to include John C. Reilly's Nova Corpsman Rhomann Dey from Guardians of the Galaxy in the film, but there was \"no real way to pull it off\".[122] Principal photography wrapped on October 28, 2016.[131] Second unit filming took place on Dirk Hartog Island off the coast of Western Australia, and in the South Island of New Zealand.[23] According to Waititi, 80 percent of the dialogue in Ragnarok was improvised, in order to create a \"very loose and collaborate mood\" among the cast, and as an attempt to replicate the tone and sensibility from his previous films. He stated, \"My style of working is I'll often be behind the camera, or right next to the camera yelling words at people, like, 'Say this, say this! Say it this way!'\"[132]\n\nIn January 2017, it was revealed that Pearson would receive sole screenwriting credit on the film, with the story credited to Kyle, Yost, and Folsom.[133] These credits were later updated the following September, with Pearson as the screenwriter and story credit for Kyle and Yost. Folsom took issue with Marvel marketing the film with these credits, noting the Writers Guild of America (WGA) had yet to determine the final credits for the film.[134] She later said that Marvel had given her a story credit on the film, but it was denied by the WGA due to their regulation that a maximum of two individuals can receive story credit, with an allowance for a writing team to count as one individual; Pearson and the team of Kyle and Yost received the story credit on Ragnarok. Folsom added that she planned to appeal the decision and that Marvel has been supportive of her throughout her attempt to receive credit.[135] By the end of the month, the writing credits were updated once again, this time simply crediting Pearson, Kyle, and Yost as screenwriters.[93][97][136]\n\nIn February 2017, Rachel House said she had a small role in the film, having worked with Waititi before.[44] Additional filming took place in Atlanta in July 2017, over three weeks,[137][138] including filming post-credit scenes.[139] One of these introduces the spaceship Sanctuary II, which belongs to Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War,[4] while the other, shown at the end of the credits, features the Grandmaster. Goldblum and Waititi improvised multiple versions of the latter scene; one unused version involved the singing of the Sakaarian national anthem, which was \"made up on the spot\".[140] Also filmed in Atlanta was the completion of a sequence where Asgardian actors perform a play based on the events of The Dark World. Neill appears in the sequence as the Odin actor, and Hemsworth's brother Luke portrays the Thor actor.[141] Explaining the sequence, Waititi said, \"if I was Loki and I was ruling Asgard, I would write a play about myself and force everyone to go and see it—change the details of the play and get a huge celebrity to play myself.\" For the Loki actor, they \"really wanted someone good and someone who's funny\", and Chris Hemsworth suggested that Matt Damon, whom he knew personally, take on the role.[52] Damon was in New York City at the time, and flew to Atlanta just to shoot the cameo \"on a lark\".[52][141] Also changed during reshoots was the location of the sequence where Thor and Loki find Odin on Earth, and Hela subsequently destroys Mjolnir. Originally set in a New York City alley, Waititi decided that the environment was distracting from the emotions of the sequence. The location was changed to Norway, which Waititi felt gave more weight to the scenes, made Odin's storyline more \"authentic\", and also allowed the characters and the audience to \"chill out for a second, and have that moment, because the rest of the film basically just runs at a clip\".[40]\n\nBy the time the reshoots for the film were completed, the film had been cut down from Waititi's initial version of two hours and forty minutes to around ninety minutes, with that expected to increase slightly with the newly filmed scenes. However, after the film's 2017 Comic Con panel, it was decided to add back a lot of the jokes that had been removed, with the final runtime being two hours and ten minutes.[123] Joel Negron and Zene Baker served as editors on the film.[23][116] Waititi described the process of deciding exactly what jokes to keep as \"very tricky ... sometimes it would be funny in the beginning of the film and then not funny at all [or] it was funny in the wrong places and in the end, we had to just keep testing jokes and testing parts of the film\".[142] Ragnarok also clarifies that an Infinity Gauntlet seen in Thor was a fake. Feige expanded, saying that it had been included in Thor as an easter egg, since Marvel Studios was \"working on The Avengers and trying to [put] that all together for the conclusion of Phase One.\" However, shortly after The Avengers released and the studio began to solidify plans for Infinity War, they realized that the gauntlet seen in Thor could not be the actual one, creating an internal theory that it was fake; this resulted in the scene in Ragnarok, which was created \"just [to have] the opportunity to call it a fake\".[141]\n\nVisual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) San Francisco and Vancouver studios,[143] with help from Base FX, Animatrik, and Virtuos; Framestore; Method Studios Vancouver; Digital Domain; Rising Sun Pictures; Luma Pictures; D Negative; Iloura; Image Engine; Trixter; The Secret Lab; WhiskyTree Inc; Fin Designs + Effects; and Perception.[23] Previsualization work was provided by The Third Floor and Day for Nite.[23][144] Luma Pictures produced over 200 shoots in eight sequences, particularly for the characters Korg (receiving assets from Framestore) and Miek. Method Studios provided over 450 shots, including Thor's opening fight against Surtur in Muspelheim and Hela's fight against the Asgardian guards. D Negative worked on over 190 shots, creating the environment for the planet Sakaar, including its junkyard landscape and wormholes, with the wormholes also created through a collaboration with Digital Domain.[145] The film's main-on-end title sequence was designed by Perception.[146]\n\nILM, who worked on previous incarnations of the Hulk, had to add much more detail to the character's facial features in Ragnarok due to the Hulk's increased dialogue. ILM visual effects supervisor Chad Wiebe explained that Ruffalo's expressions were captured fresh for the film using Medusa, a performance capture technology. With 90 different expressions captured, ILM \"built an entirely new library that would allow [Hulk] to cover a full range of normal human visual characteristics.\"[145] To help create the Hulk, a person on set was covered in green body paint, and would replicate the intended motions of the character to aid the visual effect artists.[83] Additionally, stunt actor Paul Lowe, who is under 5 feet (1.52 m) tall, stood in for Hemsworth during some of his interactions with the Hulk so that the Hulk's stuntmen would be proportionally correct. In some instances when Thor and the Hulk interacted, a digital double was used for Thor, also created by ILM, to have greater flexibility for the shots. ILM worked on all of the Hulk moments in the film outside the final fight sequence, which was completed by Framestore using ILM's assets, as Framestore was primarily responsible for rigging that sequence. Framestore completed nearly 460 shots, which featured digital doubles of Thor and Hela, Fenris, Korg, Miek, the giant Surtur at the end of the film, and over 9,000 buildings for Asgard, based on assets D Negative had from The Dark World, resulting in over 263 character, vehicle, prop, and crowd rigs.[145]\n\nRising Sun Pictures produced more than 170 visual effects shots for Ragnarok. They worked on the Valkyrie flashback sequence, with the sequence's surreal ethereal appearance achieved through a combination of motion capture, computer graphics, a 900 fps high-speed frame rate, and a special 360-degree lighting rig containing 200 strobe lights to bathe the scene in undulating patterns of light and shadow. Rising Sun also helped create the various CGI aspects of Hela, such as her \"hair wipe transition\" to her horns, and her original introduction in New York City. Following the reshoots, ImageEngine completed the new Norway introduction since Rising Sun was focused on the palace fight by then.[147]\n\nBy August 2016, Mark Mothersbaugh was hired to score the film.[148][149] The synthesized score is influenced by the work of Jean-Michel Jarre.[20] Waititi stated he would have asked the band Queen to work on the soundtrack for the film if their lead singer Freddie Mercury was still alive, because the film is \"a cool, bold, colorful cosmic adventure\" which would have suited the \"feel\" of the band.[150] Additional music featured in the film include \"Immigrant Song\" by Led Zeppelin and \"Pure Imagination\" from the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971). Patrick Doyle's themes from Thor and Brian Tyler's themes from The Dark World and Avengers: Age of Ultron, as well as Joe Harnell's \"The Lonely Man\" theme from The Incredible Hulk series, are also used in the film.[23] Hollywood Records released the film's soundtrack digitally on October 20, 2017, and physically on November 10, 2017.[151]\n\nAt the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con, a physical model of Hulk's gladiator armor was revealed,[152] concept art and rough animatics were shown,[124] and a \"mockumentary\" short titled Team Thor was screened. Directed by Waititi, it showed what Thor and Banner were doing during the events of Civil War,[124][153] with Daley Pearson appearing as Thor's Australian flatmate Darryl Jacobson. The short was released online in August 2016,[153] and with the digital download of Captain America: Civil War the following month.[154] Team Thor: Part 2 was released on the home media of Doctor Strange in February 2017, with Pearson reprising his role.[153][155] Footage and concept art for the film were shown at CinemaCon 2017.[156]\n\nOn April 10, 2017, the first teaser trailer was released. Sandy Schaefer of Screen Rant felt it was \"a strong start\" for the film, having \"a distinctly playful vibe\" by setting it to \"Immigrant Song\".[157] The Verge's Chaim Gartenberg said \"this may be the weirdest Marvel movie to date\" thanks to the costumes, makeup, and '80s aesthetic.[158] Michael Arbeiter for Nerdist was pleased with the teaser, stating, \"nothing in the MCU thus far can hold a candle to the imagination promised by this ... have any of [the previous MCU films] felt this beholden to what we've always known and loved as the adventure genre?\"[159] The teaser was viewed 136 million times in 24 hours, the third-highest in that time frame, behind The Fate of the Furious (139 million) and It (197 million). It also became Disney and Marvel's most viewed trailer within that time period, surpassing Beauty and the Beast (127 million) and Captain America: Civil War (94 million), respectively.[160] The line from the trailer of Thor saying Hulk \"is a friend from work\" was suggested to Hemsworth by a Make-A-Wish child visiting the set on the day the scene was filmed.[161]\n\nProps and costumes from the film were on display at D23 Expo 2017 along with set pieces for photo opportunities.[162] The costumes were also on display at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con,[163] where Waititi and cast members promoted the film. Exclusive clips were shown, along with a new trailer.[13][24] Ethan Anderton of /Film felt \"the blend of comedy and bright, vibrant comic book action\" in the trailer was \"incredible\".[164] Collider's Haleigh Foutch was \"in love with this trailer\" and \"all in\" on the film.[165] Germain Lussier for io9 called the trailer \"a two-and-a-half-minute ball of action, awesomeness, humor, and insanity that may be the most purely fun Marvel movie trailer we've ever seen.\"[166] The poster also released was praised, being called by Anthony Couto from Comic Book Resources as \"quite stunning\", \"insanely colorful\", and \"perfectly symmetrical\",[167] with Matt Goldberg of Collider feeling it \"really [lets] you know that this Thor movie is going to be radically different than the first two\".[168] Due to the Comic-Con presentation, Thor: Ragnarok generated over 264,000 new conversations on social media from July 17 to 23, the most out of any film during that time period, according to Comscore and its PreAct service.[169] It remained the most-discussed film on social media for two more weeks.[170][171]\n\nIn August 2017, Marvel partnered with car manufacturer Renault on a commercial supporting the release of the Kwid in Brazil. Directed by Jonathan Gurvit and shot in São Paulo, it features the Hulk destroying a satellite headed towards the city. Framestore worked on visual effects for the commercial, building on the foundation they had from working on the character in previous films.[172][173] Also in August, Marvel, in partnership with Dolby Laboratories, Synchrony Bank, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Broadcom Masters, and Society for Science & the Public, announced the \"Superpower of STEM Challenge\", aimed at females aged 15 through 18 in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) fields, to \"create an original Do-It-Yourself project that can be replicated by others\" and \"help their family, community or the world be safer, healthier or happier\". Five winners would attend the film's world premiere, receive a tour of Walt Disney Studios, and a $500 saving account from Synchrony Bank, with one grand prize winner attending \"an immersive three-day mentorship in New York City with Disney Imagineering\" to create a \"professional-level video teaching other young people how to recreate\" their winning project. They were also given the opportunity to demonstrate the project on Good Morning America.[174]\n\nFor the week of August 21, Ragnarok once again had the most social media conversations, according to comScore and its PreAct service. New clips of Thor and Hulk fighting, released on the same day as the Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor fight, helped generate the 57,000 new conversations for the week.[175] From September 25 to October 15, Ragnarok had the second-most social media conversations according to the service,[176][177] and was once again first for the week of October 16 following the release of extended clips and plot details.[178] Beginning October 6, 2017, Disney California Adventure showed a sneak peek of the film at the Sunset Showcase Theater in Hollywood Land, presented in 3D with \"special in-theater effects\".[179] Ahead of the United States release of the film, Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Blanchett, Goldblum, Ruffalo, and Thompson appeared with James Corden on The Late Late Show with James Corden to present a \"4D\" version of the film, which was actually a stage play. The cast performed various scenes from the film live in low-budget costumes and with cardboard stage props.[180] Additional promotional partners of the film included Red Robin, United Healthcare, and Screenvision Media.[181]\n\nThor: Ragnarok had its world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on October 10, 2017,[182][183] and its Australian premiere took place on October 13, on the Gold Coast.[184] It was released in the United Kingdom on October 24, 2017,[185] with additional international releases on October 25,[113] and in Australia on October 26.[186] The film was released in the United States and Canada on November 3,[63] in 4,080 theaters, of which over 3,400 were 3D, 381 were IMAX and IMAX 3D, and 204 were D-Box.[187] The film opened in 1,187 IMAX theaters globally, which was a November opening weekend record.[181] It was originally scheduled for release on July 28, 2017.[3] Thor: Ragnarok is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[188]\n\nThor: Ragnarok was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on February 20, 2018, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, DVD and On-Demand on March 6. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes; audio commentary; deleted scenes; a blooper reel; and Team Darryl, a continuation of the \"mockumentary\" short films Team Thor and Team Thor: Part 2, in which the Grandmaster moves in with Darryl after Thor leaves.[189] In one of the deleted scenes, Michael Rooker makes an appearance as Yondu, reprising the role from the first two Guardians of the Galaxy films. James Gunn, writer and director of the Guardians films, clarified that Yondu was never meant to appear in the final film, and that Rooker was on a nearby set recording material for the Halloween variant of the theme park attraction Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout!; and decided to stop by the Ragnarok set \"to goof around\".[190]\n\nThe film debuted at number one on the NPD VideoScan overall disc sales chart during its first week of release, which tracks combined DVD and Blu-ray Disc unit sales, and a dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart. Blu-ray accounted for 83% of unit sales, with 11% coming from Ultra HD Blu-ray. Thor: Ragnarok also debuted second on the Media Play News rental chart behind Coco.[191] In its second week, the film fell to number two on the NPD VideoScan chart, coming in behind Justice League, but rose to number one on the Media Play News rental chart.[192] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[193]\n\nThor: Ragnarok grossed $316 million in the United States and Canada, and $539 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $855 million.[2] In September 2017, a survey from Fandango indicated that Ragnarok was the most anticipated fall film.[194] On the weekend of November 3, 2017, the film earned $25.4 million from IMAX showings, surpassing Doctor Strange as the largest for a November weekend.[181] The film had earned $650.1 million globally, surpassing the total grosses for Thor ($449.3 million) and Thor: The Dark World ($644.6 million), by the end of its third weekend.[195][196] It became the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2017.[197] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $174.2 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it eighth on their list of 2017's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[198]\n\nThor: Ragnarok earned $46.8 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada (including $14.5 million from Thursday night previews), and had a total weekend gross of $122.7 million, which was the top film for the weekend, the sixth-best November opening, and the largest opening for all Thor films. IMAX contributed $12.2 million, which was the second-best IMAX opening of 2017 and its third-best November opening. The film's earnings on Sunday ($32.1 million), was the second-best Sunday in November after The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) ($34.5 million).[181] The film had been projected to gross $100–125 million in its opening weekend.[199][200] Ragnarok remained the number one film in its second weekend, having earned a total of $211.6 million, which surpassed the entire runs of Thor ($181 million) and The Dark World ($206.4 million).[201] In its third weekend, Thor: Ragnarok fell to third at the box office,[202] and fourth in its fourth and fifth weekends.[203][204] The film surpassed its projected total domestic gross of $280 million in its fifth weekend with $291.4 million,[204][205] Thor: Ragnarok was fifth in its sixth weekend,[206] and seventh in its seventh weekend, the final weekend it remained in the top 10.[207]\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film opened in 36 markets in its first weekend, ranking first in all, and earning $109.1 million, $6 million of which came from 189 IMAX screens. The United Kingdom opening ($16.2 million) was the best October opening for a non-James Bond film. South Korea ($15.7 million), Australia ($8.4 million), Brazil ($8.1 million), Indonesia ($5.5 million), Taiwan ($5.4 million), the Philippines ($3.8 million), Malaysia ($3.5 million), New Zealand, Vietnam, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, and South Africa had the best October opening weekend ever, while France ($7.7 million) had the second-best. Brazil also had the third-best debut for an MCU film, while New Zealand's opening was the biggest of 2017.[208] In its second weekend, Ragnarok opened at number one in 19 more markets, with the largest November opening ever in China ($56.3 million, including $6 million from 446 IMAX screens), Mexico ($10.8 million), Germany ($8.9 million), and India ($5.5 million). It also remained at number one in many existing markets. The film earned an additional $13.2 million from 788 IMAX screens, the best November opening.[209] In its third weekend, the film remained at number one in over 30 countries, and became the highest-grossing superhero film in the Czech Republic.[196] By its fifth weekend, Ragnarok had become the highest-grossing superhero film in central and eastern Europe.[210] As of December 10, 2017[update], the film's largest markets were China ($112 million), the United Kingdom ($40.4 million), and South Korea ($35.1 million).[197]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 93%, with an average score of 7.6/10, based on 439 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exciting, funny, and above all fun, Thor: Ragnarok is a colorful cosmic adventure that sets a new standard for its franchise—and the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"[212] Metacritic assigned a weighted average score of 74 out of 100 based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[213] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, the best of the Thor series, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 90% overall positive score and an 85% \"definite recommend\".[181]\n\nSheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter praised Waititi's handling of \"the clash-of-worlds CGI extravaganza\", particularly for the lighter tone he brought, with \"even the story's central bad guys [being] silly fun, hammed to the hilt by Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum.\"[214] Alonso Duralde of TheWrap wrote, \"Both the banter and the fighting, it should be noted, are excellent, so whether you go to superhero movies for the glossy escapism or the pulse-pounding action, you'll get your large soda's worth.\"[215] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film three stars out of four, described it as \"the most fun you'll ever have at a Marvel movie\" while praising the film's changing tone and direction, comparing it favourably to Guardians of the Galaxy.[216] The San Francisco Chronicle's Mick LaSalle lauded the performances of Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Blanchett, Thompson, Goldblum and Ruffalo, feeling the film \"has confidence in its characters and in its own invention, and so it avoids repetition and stays fresh\".[217]\n\nRichard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times similarly praised the film, calling the performances of the ensemble cast \"outstanding\" and Waititi's direction \"goofy and campy and marvelously self-referential\". He also said the soundtrack that was used in the climactic battle sequence, particularly Led Zeppelin's \"Immigrant Song\", was \"perfectly synced\".[218] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three out of four stars, positively comparing Hemsworth's performance to Cary Grant: \"Hemsworth's charisma holds [Thor: Ragnarok] together whenever it threatens to spin apart\".[219] Justin Chang of Los Angeles Times praised Blanchett's performance of Hela, drawing a comparison of the portrayal of her character to other iconic villains such as Maleficent and Chernabog, and the film's similar themes and tone to Flash Gordon, Star Wars (1977), and Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.[220] The Daily Telegraph's Robbie Collin gave the film four out of five, hailed it as \"one of [Marvel's] best films to date\" while commending the performances and describing Mark Mothersbaugh's musical score as \"turbo-charged\".[221] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune commended the performances of Hiddleston and Thompson as being \"wonderfully matched\". He also noted a similar directing style of Waititi to Edgar Wright's \"parodic work\" and labelled the film as \"unusually lively and buoyant\" while acknowledging the effect of a \"Marvel Fatigue factor\" towards the audiences.[222]\n\nPeter Debruge of Variety called the movie \"preposterous\", but praised Goldblum's performance.[223] Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine stated negatively that \"Thor: Ragnarok is packed tight with zooming space vehicles and noisy thunder battles, but the movie's extravagant excess is more narcotizing than energizing.\" Zacharek further added that \"Even poor Thor seems lost in all of it, and he's supposed to be its star\" while criticizing the film's visual effects as being \"an instance of fun overkill\" and \"a special-effects coma\".[224] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the story \"an uninteresting thicket of brawls, machinations and useful coincidences\" but did feel that Hemsworth \"looks happier and far more relaxed in Ragnarok than he did in the previous Thor vehicles, which is perhaps Mr. Waititi's truest achievement here.\"[225]\n\nSome critics claim that Thor: Ragnarok conceals sophisticated commentary under its comedic presentation, specifically on themes of colonial history and indigenous people. Key points in this discourse include Waititi's own indigenous Māori heritage;[226] Asgard's bloody history and Odin's whitewashing of it, as revealed by Hela; Scrapper 142's burial in alcohol of her ethnic identity as a Valkyrie;[227][228] and the Grandmaster's euphemizing of \"slaves\" as \"prisoners with jobs\".[229]\n\nA third sequel titled Thor: Love and Thunder was released on July 8, 2022.[244] Hemsworth, Thompson,[245] and Elba reprised their roles,[246] with Natalie Portman,[245] Jaimie Alexander,[247] Kat Dennings, and Stellan Skarsgård returning after not appearing in Ragnarok.[246] Portman portrayed her character taking on the mantle of Thor, similar to the comics.[248] Additionally, Chris Pratt, Pom Klementieff, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, and Sean Gunn reprise their roles as Guardians of the Galaxy members Peter Quill / Star-Lord, Mantis, Drax the Destroyer, Nebula, Groot, Rocket, and Kraglin Obfonteri.[249] Christian Bale joined the cast as the villain Gorr the God Butcher.[250]\n\nBy the release of Ragnarok, Waititi and Marvel had discussed a spin-off Marvel One-Shot short film following the characters Korg and Miek, but it was unfeasible due to Marvel's commitment to producing three feature films a year. Feige said Marvel still had plans for those characters, but did not specify.[251] Both appear in Avengers: Endgame and Love and Thunder.[252][253]\n"

        "content": "\n\nBlack Panther is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 18th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the screenplay with Joe Robert Cole, and it stars Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther alongside Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Sterling K. Brown, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis. In Black Panther, T'Challa is crowned king of Wakanda following his father's death, but he is challenged by Killmonger (Jordan), who plans to abandon the country's isolationist policies and begin a global revolution.\n\nWesley Snipes planned to make a Black Panther film in 1992, but the project did not come to fruition. In September 2005, Marvel Studios listed a Black Panther film as one of ten films based on Marvel characters intended to be distributed by Paramount Pictures. Mark Bailey was hired to write a script in January 2011. Black Panther was officially announced in October 2014, and Boseman made his first appearance as the character in Captain America: Civil War (2016). Cole and Coogler had joined by then, with additional casting in May. Black Panther was the first Marvel Studios film with a Black director and a predominantly Black cast. Principal photography took place from January to April 2017 at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in the Atlanta metropolitan area, and in Busan, South Korea.\n\nBlack Panther premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in the United States on February 16, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. Critics praised its direction, writing, acting (particularly that of Boseman, Jordan, and Wright), costume design, production values, and soundtrack, but some criticized the visual effects. Many critics considered the film to be one of the best in the MCU and it was noted for its cultural significance. The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Black Panther one of the top-ten films of 2018. It grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide and broke numerous box office records, becoming the highest-grossing film directed by a Black filmmaker, the ninth-highest-grossing film at the time of its release, the third-highest-grossing film in the U.S. and Canada that year, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2018.\n\nBlack Panther was nominated for seven awards at the 91st Academy Awards, winning three, and received numerous other accolades. It was the first superhero film to receive a Best Picture nomination, and the first MCU film to win an Academy Award. A sequel, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, was released on November 11, 2022, and a third film is in development. An animated series, Eyes of Wakanda, will be released in August 2025 on Disney+. A live-action Disney+ series set in Wakanda is also in development.\n\nThousands of years ago, five African tribes war over a meteorite containing the metal vibranium. One warrior ingests a \"heart-shaped herb\" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first \"Black Panther\". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of Wakanda. Over centuries, the Wakandans use vibranium to develop advanced technologies and isolate themselves from the world by posing as an underdeveloped country. In 1992, Wakanda king T'Chaka visits his brother N'Jobu, who is working undercover in Oakland, California. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is Zuri, another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions.\n\nIn the present day, following T'Chaka's death,[a] his son T'Challa returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. He and Okoye, leader of the Dora Milaje, extract T'Challa's ex-lover Nakia from an undercover assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother Ramonda and younger sister Shuri. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader M'Baku challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat without the benefit of the heart-shaped herb. T'Challa defeats M'Baku when he persuades him to yield rather than die.\n\nWhen Klaue and his accomplice Erik Stevens steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's husband W'Kabi urges him to bring Klaue back alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to Busan, South Korea, where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to CIA agent Everett K. Ross. A firefight erupts, and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa, who reluctantly releases him to Ross's custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.\n\nWhile Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu, as Erik was wearing a necklace that belonged to him. Zuri explains that N'Jobu had grown disillusioned with Wakanda's isolationism and planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors with the help of Klaue. Before T'Chaka could arrest N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son N'Jadaka to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Erik, a black ops U.S. Navy SEAL who adopted the nickname \"Killmonger\". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity as N'Jadaka and stating his claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri; without the powers of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa is badly injured and thought dead after Killmonger hurls him over a waterfall. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one of them. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives worldwide.\n\nNakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari as repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who also dons a nanotech suit similar to T'Challa's. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down the planes carrying vibranium weapons before they can leave Wakanda. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die as a free man rather than be incarcerated; T'Challa shows him the Wakanda sunset, and Killmonger dies peacefully.\n\nT'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps Bucky Barnes with his rehabilitation.\n\nAdditionally, Florence Kasumba and John Kani reprise their respective roles of Ayo and T'Chaka from Captain America: Civil War;[35][46] Kani's son Atandwa Kani portrays a young T'Chaka.[18] Wakandan elders in the film include Isaach de Bankolé for the River Tribe,[16]: i [47] Connie Chiume for the Mining Tribe,[16]: i [48] Dorothy Steel for the Merchant Tribe, and Danny Sapani for the Border Tribe.[16]: i  Sydelle Noel appears as Xoliswa, a member of the Dora Milaje.[49][50] Marija Abney, Janeshia Adams-Ginyard, Maria Hippolyte, Marie Mouroum, Jénel Stevens, Zola Williams, Christine Hollingsworth, and Shaunette Renée Wilson also play Doras.[16]: i  Nabiyah Be initially announced that she was playing criminal Tilda Johnson,[51] but her character was simply named Linda in the final film due to Gabrielle Dennis being cast as Johnson in the second season of Luke Cage.[16]: i [52][53] Comedian Trevor Noah voices Griot, a Wakandan ship A.I.,[54] Black Panther co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo as a patron in the South Korean casino,[18][55] and Sebastian Stan makes an uncredited appearance in the post-credits scene reprising his role as Bucky Barnes, now named the White Wolf.[56]\n\nIn June 1992, Wesley Snipes announced his intention to make a film about Black Panther,[57] and began work on it by that August.[58] Snipes felt that Africa had been portrayed poorly in Hollywood films previously, and that this film could highlight the majesty of the continent due to the title character being noble and \"the antithesis of [African] stereotypes\".[59] The next July, Snipes planned to begin The Black Panther after starring in Demolition Man (1993),[60] and a month later he expressed interest in making sequels to the film as well.[61] In January 1994, Snipes entered talks with Columbia Pictures to portray Black Panther,[62] and Black Panther co-creator Stan Lee joined the film by March;[63] it entered early development by May.[64] Snipes had discussions with several different screenwriters and directors about the project, including Mario Van Peebles and John Singleton.[59] When the film had not progressed by January 1996, Lee explained that he had not been pleased with the scripts for the project.[65] Snipes said that one of the issues with the project's development was confusion among those unfamiliar with the comics, who thought the film was about the Black Panther Party.[59]\n\nWe've yet to have a major Black comic book hero on the screen. Especially the Black Panther, which is such a rich, interesting life. It's a dream come true to originate something [like] that.\n\nIn July 1997, Black Panther was listed as part of Marvel Comics' film slate,[66] and in March 1998, Marvel reportedly hired Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti, who at the time were editors of the Black Panther comics, to work on it;[67][59] Quesada and Palmiotti have both denied this.[59] That August, corporate problems at Marvel put the project on hold.[68] A year later, Snipes was set to produce, and possibly star, in the film,[69] while Artisan Entertainment announced a deal with Marvel in May 2000 to co-produce, finance, and distribute the film.[70] In March 2002, Snipes planned to make the film or Blade 3 (2004) over the next year.[71] In July 2004, Blade 3 director David S. Goyer stated that he felt Snipes starring as Black Panther in addition to Marvel's Blade \"might be overkill\".[72]\n\nIn September 2005, Marvel chairman and CEO Avi Arad announced Black Panther as one of ten films being developed by the new Marvel Studios.[73] Marvel Studios received financing to produce the slate of ten films to be distributed by Paramount Pictures.[74] In June 2006, Snipes said he hoped to have a director for the project soon,[75] and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige reiterated in February 2007 that Black Panther was in development.[76] By that July, Singleton had been approached to direct the film.[77] Two months earlier, Fantastic Four (2005) director Tim Story expressed his interest in casting Djimon Hounsou as Black Panther if he were to direct another Fantastic Four film after Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007),[78] but a third Fantastic Four film helmed by Story went unproduced.[79] In March 2009, Marvel hired writers to help come up with creative ways to launch its lesser-known properties, including Black Panther;[80] Nate Moore, the head of the writers program, was overseeing the development of Black Panther specifically.[81] Snipes's involvement stalled at this time, as he was convicted of failing to file a tax return, serving his sentence from June 2010 to April 2013.[82] In January 2011, Marvel Studios hired documentary filmmaker Mark Bailey to write a script for Black Panther, to be produced by Feige.[83] By October 2013, the metal vibranium, which comes from Black Panther's home nation Wakanda, was introduced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe;[84] Marvel had considered showing Wakanda itself as early as Iron Man 2 (2010), but were waiting until they had \"a full idea\" of how to depict it.[10]\n\nIn October 2014, Feige announced that Black Panther would be released on November 3, 2017, with Chadwick Boseman cast as T'Challa / Black Panther.[7][8] Boseman did not audition for the role, instead discussing what he wanted to do with the part with Marvel,[85] and earned $2 million for appearing in the film.[86] The actor was set to first portray the character in Captain America: Civil War (2016).[8] Snipes gave his support for the project, despite no longer being involved.[59] Feige said that Marvel was considering minority writers and directors for the film, but would prioritize \"the best filmmakers, the best writers, the best directors possible. So I'm not going to say for sure that we're going to hire from any one demographic\". He added that they had met with former Black Panther comics writer Reginald Hudlin.[87] In January 2015, Boseman said that the film was going through a \"brainstorming phase\",[88] and the next month Marvel pushed back the release date to July 6, 2018.[89] Also in February, Feige stated that casting for the film was underway, and added that he was set to meet with directors about the film following the release of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) at the end of April.[90]\n\nBy May 2015, Marvel had discussions with Ava DuVernay to work on either Black Panther or Captain Marvel (2019) as director.[91] In June, Feige confirmed that he had met with several directors, including DuVernay, and said that he expected a decision to be made by mid- to late 2015.[92] By early July, DuVernay had passed on directing the film,[93] explaining that she had been drawn to the cultural importance of depicting a Black hero to the whole world, but disagreed with Marvel on the story and did not want to compromise her vision.[93][94] By October 2015, F. Gary Gray and Ryan Coogler had been considered as directors for the film,[95][96] though negotiations with Coogler had cooled,[96] and Gray had chosen to direct The Fate of the Furious (2017) instead.[97] Joe Robert Cole, a member of the Marvel writers program, was in talks to write the screenplay,[98] and Marvel changed the release date once again, moving it to February 16, 2018.[99] By December, discussions with Coogler were reignited after the successful opening of his film Creed (2015).[96]\n\nCoogler was confirmed as director in January 2016,[100] and said that the film was his \"most personal movie to date\" in part because he grew up reading comics,[101][102] adding, \"I feel really fortunate to be able to work on something I'm this passionate about again.\"[102][103] After being \"wooed\" by Feige for months, Coogler agreed to direct the film if he could bring collaborators from his previous films to differentiate the film from other MCU films that are often \"shot, composed, and edited by the same in-house people\". This included Fruitvale Station (2013) cinematographer Rachel Morrison,[104] as well as production designer Hannah Beachler and composer Ludwig Göransson, who both worked with Coogler on Fruitvale Station and Creed.[104][105] Coogler felt Black Panther would be unique while still fitting within the MCU's overall narrative.[101]\n\nWhat's so great about Panther is he's a superhero who ... [is] a leader in his country. It just so happens that the country is a warrior-based nation where the leaders have to be warriors, as well, so sometimes he has to go fight.\n\nIn April 2016, Feige said that Coogler was working on the script with Cole, and that filming would begin at the beginning of 2017.[107] He added that the film would be the first Marvel Studios production to feature a \"primarily African-American cast\":[108][109] Lupita Nyong'o soon entered negotiations to star as T'Challa's love interest,[27] and Michael B. Jordan joined in an undisclosed role, after previously working with Coogler on Fruitvale Station and Creed.[17] Nate Moore, serving as a producer on the film by the end of May, stated that filming would occur in Atlanta, Georgia, with Marvel \"definitely investigating shooting in Africa\" as well.[81]\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con 2016, Nyong'o was confirmed for the film, in the role of Nakia, while Jordan's role was revealed to be Erik Killmonger. Also announced was Danai Gurira as Okoye. Coogler confirmed that filming would begin in January 2017.[28][29] Additional casting occurred from September 2016 until the start of filming, with Winston Duke cast as M'Baku, a role that Yahya Abdul-Mateen II had also tested for as well as Michael James Shaw, who was later cast as Corvus Glaive in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), out of interest of visiting Africa before passing on the role;[110][111] Forest Whitaker as Zuri; Daniel Kaluuya as W'Kabi;[35] Angela Bassett as T'Challa's mother, Ramonda;[40] Sterling K. Brown as N'Jobu;[39] and Letitia Wright in an unspecified role,[112] later to be revealed as  Shuri. Dominique Thorne, who would go on to play Riri Williams / Ironheart in the sequel Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022), also auditioned to play Shuri.[113] Florence Kasumba was revealed to be reprising her role as Ayo from Captain America: Civil War.[35] Amandla Stenberg, who is biracial and light skinned, was considered for a role in the film but was not comfortable taking the place of a dark-skinned actor, and described her decision to pass on the role as \"really challenging\".[114] By January 2017, Marvel received permission from the Oakland, California-based public transit agency AC Transit to use their logo in the film for the opening flashback sequence. The setting was chosen due to Coogler growing up in that area.[115]\n\nThe production team was inspired by Ta-Nehisi Coates's run on Black Panther, who was writing the comic at the same time as they were working on the film. Of particular inspiration was Coates's poetic dialogue, Brian Stelfreeze's art, and \"some of the questions that it's asking\".[106] The film was also inspired by the comic runs of Jack Kirby, Christopher Priest (which Coogler felt most influenced the film), Jonathan Hickman, and Hudlin. Characters for the film were picked from throughout the comics based on what worked for the film's story.[38] The ceremonial betrothal aspect of the Dora Milaje was not adapted from the comics for the film.[10] Coogler had hoped to include Spider-Man villain Kraven the Hunter early in the process because of a scene in Priest's run that had T'Challa fighting Kraven, but the rights to the character were not available due to Sony Pictures owning all rights to Spider-Man characters.[116] Donald Glover and his brother Stephen made some minor contributions to an early draft of the script, developing the relationship between T'Challa and his younger sister Shuri.[117] Moore noted that an early script had more scenes outside of Wakanda to explore \"what it means to be African and African-American in the world a bit more\", and hoped these could be revisited in a later film, particularly a \"super cool\" sequence that was storyboarded before being cut.[118] Coogler and Robert Cole had considered including the Golden Age black hero Eli Bradley / Patriot for a while, but they ultimately excluded him to focus on Wakanda.[119] Eli Bradley was eventually featured in the Disney+ miniseries The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021), portrayed by Elijah Richardson.[120]\n\nFeige described Black Panther as \"a big geopolitical action adventure\" that focuses on family and T'Challa learning to be king,[108] with Civil War laying the groundwork for T'Challa's morality and establishing the geopolitical landscape that he would have to deal with on returning to Wakanda.[121] Moore compared the politics and humor of the film to Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), saying that the former would be inherent but not \"preachy\", and that the latter would avoid the tones of Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Ant-Man (2015).[10] He also said the film would be a cross between The Godfather (1972) and the James Bond films as a \"big, operatic family drama centered around a world of international espionage\".[19] Coogler was influenced by 1970s films such as the works of Francis Ford Coppola in that decade, as well as crime fiction. He also watched the film A Prophet (2009) for inspiration.[122] Feige called the film's story \"rich in culturally relevant ideas\", with Boseman indicating there were parallels to \"pull from\" in the film in relation to Donald Trump becoming President of the United States after Barack Obama, though Feige added that \"these are conversations we were having two years ago because that is inherently the story within the comics.\"[44] Moore said the film does not depend on the plots of any other MCU films, but it does affect the wider MCU moving forward,[10] with Feige stating the film was \"a very important\" link to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019).[108][123] Civil War did introduce the Wakandan language, based on the Xhosa language, which Boseman was taught by John Kani, who portrays T'Challa's father, King T'Chaka.[124] Additional actors portraying Wakandans in Black Panther learned the language,[125] with Coogler making the use of the language \"a priority... as much as possible\". Coogler tried to incorporate Xhosa \"in natural and authentic situations\", such as when multiple Wakandans were speaking in the presence of nonnatives and wanted to say something they would not understand. John Kani's son Atandwa served as a dialect coach on the film along with his father.[126]\n\nCole called the film an historic opportunity to depict a Black superhero \"at a time when African-Americans are affirming their identities while dealing with vilification and dehumanization\". It was important to root the film in the actual cultures of Africa, with the filmmakers consulting with experts on the region of Africa that Wakanda is supposed to be located in,[127] rooting the film \"in reality first and then build[ing] out from there\".[6] Coogler's vision for Wakanda was inspired by the southern African country Lesotho, a country which has historically been \"an enclave, able to protect its independence because of its terrain\" and was only lightly colonized by the British;[128][129] the country's traditional blankets are also featured in the film.[128] Coogler compared the rarity of vibranium existing only in Wakanda to the real-life mineral coltan that can almost only be found in Congo.[130] He wanted Wakanda to feel like a full country with multiple distinct tribes,[37] and created a project bible that detailed each Wakandan tribe to guide the design process. Special care was taken to create a futuristic look that was not alien,[10] as some of Jack Kirby's original comic designs appeared.[131]\n\nBeachler wanted to honor the comic designs, but fill in the gaps with research concentrated on Sub-Saharan Africa, pulling inspiration from Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Ethiopia,[132] as well as the designs of Zaha Hadid,[10] and the pre-colonization architecture of the historic Mali Empire and the city of Timbuktu.[133] Moore described this approach of taking inspiration from many different sources as a love letter to Africa.[10] Beachler looked at the architecture of existing tribes, and then tried to advance the technology naturally rather than if Wakanda had been colonized.[132] Circular motifs, signifying the transmission of energy, were an important theme throughout the film. Older locations depicted in the film, such as Warrior Falls, the City of the Dead, and the Hall of Kings, were juxtaposed with the more modern Afro-punk style of the Golden City, the capital.[10] Rondavels were incorporated into the tops of Wakanda's skyscrapers, inspired by the appearance of mountains at Blyde River Canyon in South Africa.[132]\n\nBeachler created different sigils and architecture for each of the Wakandan tribes, with the Border Tribe inspired by Lesotho, the Merchant Tribe having a sigil based on Nigerian writing, and the Golden Tribe using a sun symbol found throughout Africa. Gorilla City, home to the Jabari Tribe, was originally set in a rain forest, but Coogler suggested that it be found up a mountain in snow.[10] Beachler based the written form of the Wakandan language on an old Nigerian language. She consulted with mining and metallurgy experts for the vibranium technology,[16]: 15  including for the vibranium mine where the substance is depicted as glowing blue rocks before it is refined into the stainless steel look previously seen in the MCU. The film also adapts the kimoyo bead technology from the comics, and features sand-based technology. Beachler wanted futuristic elements of the film to be consistent with projections of what real world technology may be like in 25 or 30 years, such as the maglev and hovercraft technology used in vehicles. The Wakandan vehicles include a maglev train for carrying vibranium; the king's Royal Talon Fighter, which looks like a mask from the top and bottom; and the Dragon Flyer, inspired by the Congo peafowl.[10]\n\nThe majority of Beachler's sets were constructed on sound stages in Atlanta, including the Tribal Council, Shuri's design space, and the Hall of Kings. The Tribal Council set was built with a glass floor through which an old ruin can be seen. The exterior set for Warrior Falls was built on a backlot north of Atlanta, and was inspired by the Oribi Gorge. The set was 36 feet (11 m), made up of a six-foot-high (1.8 m) pool, and then 30-foot-high (9.1 m) cliff faces that were designed to be extended to 100 feet (30 m) with visual effects. A framework for the cliffs was hand-sculpted from industrial styrofoam, with a system of tunnels built-in to the design to allow extras to climb up to different areas of the cliffs. The framework was then covered with 25,000 cubic feet (710 m3) of foam that was sculptured to match rocks found at Oribi Gorge. The pool was filled using six large pumps, so as to create a waterfall above the ledge at the bottom. The base of the pool was made from padding so stunts could safely be carried out on the set, but designed to look like rocks and to have enough grip that the actors would not fall over in the water. The set was completed in four months, and was used for two weeks of filming.[16]: 16 \n\nCostume designer Ruth E. Carter referenced the Maasai, Himba, Dogon, Basotho, Tuareg, Turkana, Xhosa, Zulu, Suri and Dinka people in her designs.[134][135] She also examined appropriate works by Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake, French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, and American fashion designer Donna Karan.[135] Winnie Mandela provided inspiration to Carter for Angela Bassett's costumes.[10]\n\nThe Dora Milaje costumes primarily used red to reflect different African cultures, and included beaded tabards that feature talismans that would be passed down from mother to daughter. Carter wanted to avoid the \"girls in the bathing suits\" look, and instead have the Dora Milaje wear full armor that they would practically need for battle. She also had to take actors' stunt work into consideration.[10] Anthony Francisco, the Senior Visual Development Illustrator, noted the Dora Milaje costumes were based 80 percent on the Maasai, five percent on samurai, five percent on ninjas, and five percent on the Ifugao people from the Philippines. The arm band and neck rings were a reference to the Southern Ndebele people and denote stature. As such, General Okoye has gold bands and rings while the other Dora Milaje wear silver.[24]\n\nThe costumes for T'Challa combined his role as king and as the head of the military, including combining a kente cloth cloak with military boots.[10] Carter also used distinct colors and patterns for each of Wakanda's tribes, such as green with shells for the River Tribe based on the Suri; blue with wood for the Border Tribe; black with royal purple for the Black Panther and the Royal Palace;[10][24] plums and purples for the Merchant Tribe in reference to the Tuareg; and ochre for the Mining Tribe inspired by the Himba.[24] Three out of every five people in Wakanda go barefoot. The Wakandans wear \"normal\" clothes outside of the country, with the colors of their costumes kept consistent.[10] Overall, Carter created 700 costumes for the film, working with \"an army\" of illustrators, designers, mold makers, fabric dyers, jewelry makers and more.[135]\n\nHair department head Camille Friend referenced traditional African art, fabrics, hair, and textures, and the current-day natural hair movement in her designs. Friend strived to keep the actors' hair natural, using \"braids, locs and twists\", and when necessary, extensions and wigs. As with Carter, Friend designed each tribe to have their own identifiable aesthetic, such as the Jabari Tribe having hair styled with \"very straight, clean lines\" and war-paint detail, inspired by Senegalese warriors.[24]\n\nPrincipal photography had begun by January 21, 2017,[136] at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in the Atlanta metropolitan area,[137][138] under the working title Motherland.[139][140] Filming also took place at Pinewood Atlanta Studios,[141] and in the Sweet Auburn neighborhood in Atlanta, which doubled as Oakland; the High Museum of Art, which served as the fictional Museum of Great Britain in London; and Atlanta City Hall, which served as a United Nations building.[137][142] Cinematographer Rachel Morrison, who was eager to work on Black Panther after working with Coogler on Fruitvale Station,[143] first watched all of the other MCU films to understand the established \"language\". She wanted to \"push\" that language and feature more contrast in color. Visual effects supervisor Geoff Baumann provided Morrison with before-and-after shots of scenes from Civil War so she could understand what elements are captured on set and what is created digitally.[144] She filmed in 3.4K ArriRaw with Arri Alexa XT Plus cameras and Panavision Primo lenses,[145] primarily using a two-camera set-up with a third or fourth camera on occasion. Morrison said that lighting was her biggest challenge, the magnitude of which \"was much bigger than I'd experienced before\", and made extensive use of Arri SkyPanel LED light fixtures, which she could preprogram from an iPad. Some sets were completely surrounded by SkyPanels.[143]\n\nShortly after filming started, Atandwa Kani stated that he would appear in the film alongside his father, the latter reprising the role of T'Chaka,[46] while on-set photographs revealed that Martin Freeman would reprise his role as Everett K. Ross.[136] Marvel announced that production was underway on January 26, and confirmed the casting of Freeman, Wright, and John Kani, while revealing that Andy Serkis would reprise his role as Ulysses Klaue from Avengers: Age of Ultron.[42][146] Atandwa portrays a younger version of his father's character, and also served as a cultural consultant during filming. Dialect coach Beth McGuire worked to ensure there was continuity between the various actors who had to use \"Wakandan accents\".[16]: 22  Jordan joined the production later than the rest of the core cast. He felt that this aided his performance, since his character is separate from and in conflict with the other characters. Because of this, Jordan kept to himself while he was on set.[10] Since Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War were filming simultaneously in Atlanta, both production teams worked together closely to ensure a unified presentation of Wakanda in the films, as the country also plays a large role in Infinity War.[138]\n\nAdditional filming took place in South Korea,[146] with the city of Busan serving as the setting of a car chase scene that involved 150 cars and over 700 people.[140][147] Coogler and Morrison referenced the car chase sequences from Bullitt (1968), Drive (2011), and The French Connection (1971), taking the best elements from each for Black Panther's sequence.[144] Filming in Busan began on March 17,[148] at the Jagalchi Fish Market.[149] Filming moved to Gwangalli Beach on March 21,[148] with other South Korean filming locations including Marine City in the Haeundae District and at the Gwangandaegyo Bridge.[147] The production crew hired hundreds of current and former film students from local universities as staff or assistant staff during the South Korea filming.[148] Filming in the country wrapped on March 27,[147] with additional location shooting also taking place at the Rwenzori Mountains and Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda.[145][150] John Marzano served as cinematographer for aerial footage of South Africa, Zambia, Uganda, and South Korea.[145][151] At CinemaCon 2017, Wright was revealed to be portraying Shuri in the film.[152] Filming concluded on April 19, 2017.[105]\n\nBlack Panther was edited by Michael Shawver and Debbie Berman, with Shawver spending time on set during filming as well as at an editing suite near the Atlanta production base.[153] Berman joined the film after an initial director's cut had been produced, two weeks after she completed work on Marvel's Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017),[154] because Coogler likes to have both a male and female editing his films.[153] She believed that she was chosen by Marvel because she is South African, and had been expressing interest in Black Panther throughout the editing process for Homecoming after first seeing the character in Civil War.[154] Shawver said that a lot of their time editing was spent discussing how their work was affecting the audience. For instance, Shawver felt that initial versions of the first Warrior Falls fight fell \"flat\" and used techniques he learned working with Coogler on Creed to have the editing move back-and-forth to mimic the back-and-forth of the fighters. He also felt that adding more reaction shots to the crowd during the fight gave more weight to T'Challa's victory at the end.[155] During work on the final battle, Berman pointed out to Coogler that the female Dora Milaje are rescued by the all-male Jabari tribe, which she felt undermined the focus on female characters leading up to that moment. Coogler agreed, and subsequently added female Jabari fighters to the scene through additional photography, including the first onscreen Jabari fighter in the scene. Berman felt that this was an important change that would not have been made if only men were editing the film.[154]\n\nAs first hinted by Coogler in January 2018,[122] the film includes two post-credit scenes: one showing T'Challa address the United Nations; and one featuring Sebastian Stan reprising his role as Bucky Barnes.[56] The first scene was originally intended to be part of the actual ending of the film, but was moved to during the credits so the film could conclude in Oakland, where it begins. Coogler felt having this symmetry was important.[156] In the scene, T'Challa says \"The foolish build barriers, while the wise build bridges.\" Some felt this was a reference to the political climate of the presidency of Donald Trump, but Coogler stated that the line was added before Trump's election and was simply an African proverb that his wife had found. His intention with the scene was to inspire the audience by making T'Challa seem like a real person in a familiar, real-world environment, similar to how Tony Stark was treated in Iron Man (2008).[157] Coogler was not mandated by Marvel to feature connections to other films, but was interested in addressing the fact that Barnes was in Wakanda (per the end of Civil War) because it would be fun for the audience. He did not feel the character fit in the body of the film, but felt that an end-credits scene was appropriate.[156] Coogler originally pitched a post-credits scene teasing Namor, which would have depicted wet footprints leading to the throne in the Wakandan palace;[158] this did not occur in part because of rights issues with the character. Namor debuts instead in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, portrayed by Tenoch Huerta.[159]\n\nVisual effects for the film were created by: Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) with help from Virtuos, Stereo D, and Scanline VFX; Double Negative; Luma Pictures; Mammal Studios; Method Studios; Perception; Rise Visual Effects Studios; Torm Studios; Trixter; Cantina Creative; Lola VFX; Capital T; Exceptional Minds; Technicolor VFX; Rodeo FX; Imageloom VFX; Anibrain; Method Pune; Bot VFX; Pixstone Images; Futureworks; Vertigo Visual; FX3X; and Yannix Thailand Co.[16]: xii–xx [160] Previsualization was completed by Digital Domain and The Third Floor.[16]: xi  Geoffrey Baumann served as visual effects supervisor.[155]\n\nComparing Black Panther to other MCU films, Baumann noted that the visual effects department often have free rein when creating otherworldly science fiction designs, but had to be more specific with this film due to the need to be authentic to African culture and geography. For the Warrior Falls environment, the amphitheater-like cliff walls had to be populated with digital spectators that could not simply be copy-and-pasted around the set due to the precise costume designs created by Carter for each tribe and character. Instead, the visual effects department had to work with the costumers to individually model each digital extra for the sequence. Additionally, visual effects were also used to adjust the opening sequence after test audiences were confusing the characters of T'Chaka and T'Challa, both dressed as the Black Panther. Artists digitally added some grey to T'Chaka's beard and gold trimmings to his suit to help differentiate the characters.[155]\n\nILM was primarily responsible for creating the digital urban environments of Wakanda. ILM VFX supervisor Craig Hammack compared this work to his time on Tomorrowland (2015), but noted the additional challenge of not just building a futuristic city, but also one that was culturally appropriate. He explained that African culture has a \"certain amount of earthy material qualities that make things difficult to design as a futuristic city,\" which would typically use much steel and glass. ILM looked to real life examples that blend modern architecture with natural environments like One Central Park in Sydney and The Pearl of Africa Hotel in Kampala, but also had to \"depart from a strict understanding of physics and go into a movie cheat world\" at times to produce the desired look. Hammack was also inspired by the architecture of Uganda, where he spent time while aerial footage for the film was being shot. 60,000 individual buildings were designed and modeled for the city, which Hammack said was the first thing ILM began work on and also the last thing they were doing when the film was completed. Other things that ILM worked on during the production included set extensions and blue-screen replacements for interior sets, and the first rhinoceros shown in the film. For T'Challa's ancestral plane scenes, ILM replaced the basic set that was used with a full CG environment including an acacia tree and animated panthers. The sky was based on the Northern Lights, with this first designed for nighttime scenes before being replicated for daytime scenes in which the animators had to work hard to keep the effects visible. ILM also added additional sand for the burial sequences so Boseman could breathe during filming, and additional flames when Killmonger burns the heart-shaped herb.[145]\n\nMethod Studios created many of the natural environments of Wakanda. The company built a 3,600 km2 (1,400 sq mi) landscape that is visible in various aerial shots in the film, which was based on multiple landscapes from across Africa. Method was also responsible for creating Black Panther's and Killmonger's digital suits, including developing the look of the nanotechnology they use. They created many of the film's digital characters, vehicles, and weapons, with some of those digital creatures being rhinoceroses for the final battle, a sequence that Method did the majority of the work for. Because these rhinoceroses did not have to be seen on screen with the one designed by ILM, only basic structures, scale, and details of the character models had to be shared between the two companies. Much of the work for the final fight included crowd simulation, with Method working alongside the stunt coordinators in motion capture sessions to give each fighter a unique style. In addition to randomizing the height and weight of each digital fighter, the models had to incorporate specific design elements from the costumers. Method also worked on the vibranium mine and Shuri's laboratory, including animating the gadgets seen in the latter.[145]\n\nLuma Pictures worked on the Busan car chase sequence, digitally creating the cars featured in the sequence based on CAD models and on-set reference. Multiple digital versions of the same car were created, so the production could have the actual cars crash and do various stunts with them, with Luma then inserting the digital versions to augment these moments. Luma also created the sonic forces from Klaue's cannon, while Scanline VFX worked on digitally removing Serkis's left arm for the London museum heist sequence.[161] Several companies worked on the vibranium sand effects used in Wakandan technology, including ILM for the beginning of the film.[145] Perception spent 18 months researching real-world technologies, phenomena, and visual themes to aid them in their work on the film. Their designs for the vibranium sand were based on research being done with ultrasonic transducers for the purpose of mid-air haptics and acoustic levitation. They integrated this research into the kimoyo beads worn by Wakandans and as a working interface on the royal talon fighter. Perception also created the traditional displays on the talon fighter and in Shuri's lab. For the talon fighter, the company \"experimented with parallax, depth, and volume in the information being displayed, as well as developing a unique color palette to brand the Wakandan tech\". In Shuri's lab, Perception adjusted the hues on the wall to match her attire, and for her healing room \"proposed that the hexagonal pattern seen on the wall actually reveal itself to be articulating panels\" that \"pulse and ripple\". The company also created the function of Black Panther's suit with nano technology and \"layering the suit with different patterns as well as adding 'sub-dermal' luminescent tattoos\", the virtual car chase with Shuri and T'Challa, and designed the opening prologue, with the final version created by Storm VFX. Perception also created the main-on-end title sequence.[162]\n\nAfter reading the script, composer Ludwig Göransson decided to go to Africa to do research for the film.[163] He spent a month in Senegal, first traveling around with musician Baaba Maal on his tour,[163][164] and then spending several weeks working with local musicians to form the \"base\" of his score.[165][166] Göransson was particularly drawn to the talking drum and the tambin, or Fula flute, to use in his character themes,[163][167] along with horns.[166] Nate Moore compared the work Göransson did in defining the sound of the film to the use of music by James Gunn in the Guardians of the Galaxy films,[168] with the composer pushing Marvel out of their comfort zone.[169]\n\nKendrick Lamar produced the film's curated soundtrack, Black Panther: The Album, along with Top Dawg Entertainment founder Anthony Tiffith, after Coogler wanted to include original songs from Lamar in the film because his \"artistic themes align with those we explore in the film\".[170][171] The soundtrack features songs that are heard in the film as well as others that are inspired by it, with the other artists featured the majority of \"top-billing names\" under Top Dawg Entertainment.[171] Göransson collaborated with Lamar and producer Sounwave on the soundtrack.[172] Three singles from the album were released throughout January and February 2018: \"All the Stars\",[170] \"King's Dead\",[173] and \"Pray for Me\".[174] Black Panther: The Album was released on February 9, 2018,[175] while a soundtrack of Göransson's score was released on February 16.[176] An extended play titled Black Panther: Wakanda Remixed, featuring remixes of five cues from Göransson's score, was released on August 16, 2018. Göransson worked with several other artists to create the remixes.[177]\n\nMarvel debuted early footage and concept art from the film at a press event in April 2017. Kyle Buchanan of Vulture praised the cinematography, costume and production design, and Black cast, saying \"Black Panther doesn't look like any of the other Marvel movies ... If this is what the future of superhero movies looks like, deal me in.\"[105] The screened footage was the first time Marvel had shown raw dailies, which Feige said they did to show off the \"highest-class cast we've had\" despite editing having not yet begun.[178] A poster was released ahead of the first teaser trailer, which premiered during Game 4 of the 2017 NBA Finals.[179][180] Fans on Twitter felt the poster was poorly photoshopped,[181] and it was compared to a real-life picture of Black Panther Party co-founder Huey P. Newton.[179] The trailer received a much more positive response, with Peter Sciretta of /Film finding it unexpected and refreshing,[182] io9's Charles Pulliam-Moore calling it \"every bit as intense as you were hoping it would be\",[183] and Andrew Husband for Uproxx feeling the single teaser outshone the entire Homecoming marketing campaign.[180] It was viewed 89 million times in 24 hours, generating 349,000 mentions (second only to the amount the Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) teaser received) and \"dominated the conversation on social media\" over Game 4.[184][181] Per comScore and its PreAct service, the film was the subject of the most new social media conversations for the rest of the week,[185] and the second-most for the week ending June 18, behind Homecoming.[186]\n\nCostumes from the film were on display at D23 Expo 2017 and the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con,[187][188] with Coogler, Boseman, and other members of the cast presenting exclusive footage of the film at the latter event, to a standing ovation from the audience.[189] In September, Coogler, Gurira, and Moore participated in a panel at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference, where exclusive footage from the film was also shown and met with a positive response.[130] On October 16, 2017, a full trailer was released. Dave Trumbore for Collider praised the trailer for showing an \"unmistakable sense of style\" unique to the character,[190] while BamSmackPow's Brendan Day felt the trailer \"does everything right\".[191] Writing for Rolling Stone, Tre Johnson felt the trailer showed T'Challa as \"someone with the arrogance of [John] Shaft, the coolness of [Barack] Obama and the hot-headed impulsiveness of Kanye West\".[192] A few days later, Marvel Comics published a prelude tie-in comic focusing on one of T'Challa's first missions as the Black Panther set around the time of Iron Man.[193] The first College Football Playoff National Championship halftime show was organized by Disney for the 2018 championship game, with Kendrick Lamar performing to promote Black Panther: The Album and the beginning of ticket sales for the film.[194]\n\nBy February 12, Black Panther was the most-tweeted about film of 2018 with more than 5 million tweets globally,[195] and in mid-March it became the most-tweeted-about film ever with 35 million.[196] During New York Fashion Week, designers Cushnie et Ochs, Ikiré Jones, Tome, Sophie Theallet, Fear of God, Chromat, and LaQuan Smith created custom pieces that were inspired by the film for an event titled \"Welcome to Wakanda: Fashion for the Black Panther Era\".[194][197] Marvel Studios formed a partnership with Lexus on the film, with the 2018 Lexus LC being featured in it.[198] The partnership produced a graphic novel, Black Panther: Soul of a Machine, which was released in December 2017 from writers Fabian Nicieza, Geoffrey Thorne, and Chuck Brown;[198][199][200] a concept coupe from Lexus inspired by the character;[200] and a Super Bowl LII commercial featuring Boseman, Gurira and Wright,[201] which had 4.3 million views on social media after its Super Bowl airing, according to RelishMix.[202] Other marketing partners included shoe manufacturer Clarks creating a film-inspired variant of their Originals' Trigenic Evo shoe;[203] PepsiCo and Unilever launching an arts program for young people in urban areas to be mentored by established artists; Brisk created an interactive Black Panther installation at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game; Lancôme highlighted a line of makeup that Nyong'o and Wright used at the film's premiere; and Synchrony Financial with Marvel awarded the Ghetto Film School Fellows program with a $50,000 grant, with Coogler speaking to the school's students.[202]\n\nOverall, Black Panther had the most expansive advertising budget and biggest line of merchandise of any Marvel non-sequel.[204] Deadline Hollywood estimated that budget to be $150 million.[3] Asad Ayaz, Executive Vice President of Marketing for Marvel films, said the campaign was about \"super-serving\" Black audiences while still trying to appeal to all, in order to make the film \"feel like a cultural event\".[194] Disney and Marvel created a \"synergy program\" with the College Football Playoffs on ESPN, the ABC television series Black-ish, Grey's Anatomy, Scandal, and How to Get Away With Murder, the Freeform series Grown-ish, and the Bravo franchise The Real Housewives.[202] Marketing outside the United States was \"fairly uniform\", though in the Middle East the focus was kept on Black Panther in-costume as superhero films \"just keep working\" there according to Gianluca Chakra of Middle East distributor Front Row. This was the same for Asian territories. A Wakanda exhibit was featured in malls in seven Chinese cities, along with displays showing Black Panther with other MCU characters. A special trailer created for China had Boseman explain the character's connection to other MCU films. Weibo attended the Los Angeles premiere to take pictures and videos with the cast and crew in real time for China, the first time the company has partnered with a foreign studio for this type of engagement.[205]\n\nBlack Panther had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018.[206] The premiere featured a purple carpet that was flanked by women dressed as the Dora Milaje,[207] while Coogler, cast members, and other guests wore African clothing at the request of Marvel for attendees to wear \"royal attire\", honoring the African setting of the film.[2][207] Ahead of the premiere screening, Coogler received an extended standing ovation before he announced the cast of the film.[207] Black Panther was released in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Taiwan on February 13,[208] in South Korea on February 14,[209] and the United States on February 16.[99] In the United States, the film opened in 4,020 theaters,[202] with over 3,200 of those in 3D,[210] 404 in IMAX,[202] over 660 in premium large format, and over 200 D-Box locations. In addition, Black Panther was the first MCU film to be converted to ScreenX, a 270-degree wraparound format, that played in over 101 locations in eight countries.[210] The film opened in most markets in its first weekend of release including a \"cross-nation release\" in Africa, a first for a Disney film.[130][150][208] Black Panther was originally scheduled for release on November 3, 2017,[7] before moving to July 6, 2018, to accommodate Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).[89] It was then moved to the final February date to accommodate Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018).[99] Black Panther is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[211]\n\nWhen Black Panther premiered in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on April 18, 2018, it was the first public film viewing after a nearly-30-year-old ban on cinemas was rescinded in December 2017. The premiere took place in a cinema owned by AMC Theatres in the King Abdullah Financial District of Riyadh.[212][213] Disney's regional distributor, Italia Film, said 40 seconds of the film had been removed, which was in line with cuts made to the film across the region. Awwad Alawwad, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Culture and Information, and Adam Aron, CEO of AMC Entertainment, were in attendance for the premiere along with other diplomats and industry experts; no one from the cast or production team was in attendance.[214] Black Panther screened there for five days before Avengers: Infinity War premiered on April 26.[213]\n\nBlack Panther returned to 250 AMC Theatres in the United States from February 1 until February 7, 2019, for free, with two showings of the film occurring at each theater for the week. The week-long return was in honor of the start of Black History Month and the film winning two Screen Actors Guild Awards and earning an Academy Award Best Picture nomination. Disney also gave a $1.5 million grant to the United Negro College Fund.[215]\n\nBlack Panther was released for digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on May 8, 2018, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on May 15, 2018. The digital and Blu-ray releases included several bonus features: behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, an exclusive look at Ant-Man and the Wasp, and a featurette on the first ten years of the MCU.[216] As of November 11, 2018[update], the film's Blu-ray and DVD releases have sold 4.2 million units and grossed $87 million in the United States, making it the best-selling film of 2018.[217] Black Panther was originally made available on Netflix, but was removed in March 2020 after Disney regained license for the film.[218] It was released on Disney+ on March 4, 2020, in the United States and Canada.[219]\n\nOn June 19, 2020, TBS, TNT, and truTV aired the film, along with Just Mercy (2019), another film which also starred Jordan, to coincide with the celebrations of Juneteenth and to support social justice against systemic racism in response to the murder of George Floyd.[220] On August 30, 2020, ABC hosted a television special Chadwick Boseman: A Tribute for a King,[221] aired after the film's commercial-free premiere on the same day, to honor Boseman, who died on August 28, 2020, from colon cancer.[222] The special was presented by Robin Roberts, and featured about Boseman's life, career and legacy, as well as tributes served by celebrities, political figures and fans; it also featured other Marvel co-stars, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, and Paul Rudd, along with Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige, and Disney CEO Bob Iger, sharing their experiences on working with Boseman, and the legacy he had left behind.[223] The special released on Disney+ after its television debut.[224]\n\nOn November 29, 2020, Marvel changed the studio's production logo animation in the opening of the film to include images of Boseman from the film, as well as his appearances in Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame. Black Panther concept art and excerpts from the script were also included. This change was done on the Disney+ version of the film, to honor Boseman on what would have been his 44th birthday.[225] Despite being released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release only includes the cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio version that was used for non-IMAX screenings.[226] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[227]\n\nBlack Panther grossed $700.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $649.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.350 billion.[4] It became the highest-grossing solo superhero film,[228] the third-highest-grossing film of the MCU and superhero film overall,[229] the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time,[230] and the highest-grossing film by an African-American director.[231][232] It is the fifth MCU film and 33rd overall to surpass $1 billion,[233] and the second-highest-grossing film of 2018.[234] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $476.8 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it second on their list of 2018's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[3]\n\nThe film had the fourth-highest pre-sale tickets sold on Fandango, and became the top pre-seller for a superhero film and for a film released in February as well as the first quarter of a year.[235] The first 24 hours of ticket pre-sales on the site were the largest for a Marvel film.[236] Black Panther also had the highest number of ticket pre-sales for any superhero film at Alamo Drafthouse Cinema,[237] while out-selling all previous Marvel films at AMC Theatres,[238] and having strong pre-sales at Atom Tickets.[210] Four days before its United States opening, IMAX Entertainment CEO Greg Foster revealed that Black Panther had the most advanced IMAX ticket sales of any Marvel film, which did not appear to have peaked 10 days before opening as with most films; Black Panther, he said, \"feels like it's going to peak the day it opens\".[239] Fandango's pre-sales ultimately accounted for 30% of the film's United States and Canada opening weekend gross, one of the largest box office shares for any film in Fandango's history.[240]\n\nEarly projections for Black Panther's opening weekend ranged from $80–170 million,[208][241] with rival film studios projecting the total to be as high as $180–200 million;[210] Disney projected the gross to be around $150 million.[208] It ultimately earned $75.8 million on its opening day (including $25.2 million from Thursday night previews), and $242.1 million over the four-day Presidents' Day weekend.[202] This was the best Presidents' Day weekend opening,[242] and the best opening weekend for a Black director and predominantly Black cast.[243] With a total gross of $202 million, the film had the highest February opening weekend, surpassing Deadpool (2016).[244] For AMC Theatres, Black Panther became the highest-grossing film ever at 33 locations,[245] and had the biggest opening weekend for 150 of them. Overall, this was the second-largest opening weekend ever for the chain with 4.4 million admissions. Atom Tickets sold more tickets for Black Panther than any other superhero film.[246] Anthony D'Alessandro of Deadline Hollywood described the success as \"summer box office records during the second month of the year\".[202]\n\nThe week after its opening weekend was also strong, with a record-setting Tuesday and Thursday earnings,[247][248] becoming the MCU film with the highest first-week gross.[249] It also surpassed $300 million in eight days, becoming the fastest MCU film to do so.[248] In its second weekend, the film earned $112 million, which was a 45 percent decrease from its opening week, the smallest decline in a second weekend for any MCU film. It was the second-best second weekend ever, and the best second weekend for a Marvel film beating The Avengers ($103 million).[250] Black Panther also became the highest-grossing film released in February, surpassing The Passion of the Christ (2004) ($370.3 million).[251]\n\nBlack Panther was the first film to hold the number one spot at the box office for at least five weekends since Avatar (2009),[252] and the first February release to hold the top box office spot for five weekends since Wayne's World in 1992.[253] The film declined over subsequent weekends, but remained in the top ten through its tenth.[254][255] In its eleventh weekend, the film rose back up at the box office, in part because of the release of Avengers: Infinity War the same weekend,[230] and the following weekend it earned $3.14 million from over 1,600 locations. D'Alessandro noted the gross from that number of locations indicated people were continuing to see Black Panther in conjunction with Infinity War.[256] Black Panther was in the top ten again in its thirteenth weekend.[257]\n\nIn its 25th weekend, Disney increased the film's theater count from 10 to 25 to help the film become the third ever to surpass $700 million.[258][259] Brian Gallagher of IGN felt the film surpassing $700 million was more impressive than Infinity War's $2.045 billion worldwide gross at the time. Gallagher pointed to Black Panther being more consistent each week, never having more than a 50% weekend decrease until the 15th frame while Infinity War dropped 55% in its second weekend, its February release date without any major competition from other films, and the fact it was \"a rallying cry for diversity and representation\".[259] Black Panther is the highest-grossing film of 2018 and became the third-highest-grossing film of all time,[260] as well as the highest-grossing superhero film.[254][261][262] Its IMAX total of $36 million is the most for any MCU film.[250] In July 2020, due to the worldwide closure of cinemas during the COVID-19 pandemic and limits on which films played, Black Panther returned to 421 theaters—mostly drive-ins—and grossed $367,000, the second-highest for the weekend behind The Empire Strikes Back's (1980) re-release.[263]\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film opened in 48 territories in its first weekend and earned $184 million,[264][242] opening at number one in most territories (though second in some, where Fifty Shades Freed performed better, such as Germany and Italy). It became the top February opening in many countries,[264][265] including in the African market and the Middle East, while taking the top spot across Latin America.[264] IMAX accounted for $11.5 million of the opening weekend gross, from 272 screens,[246] which included record opening weekends in the format for Nigeria, Kenya, and Indonesia.[264] In its second weekend, in 55 territories, the film earned $83.5 million and remained number one in most, including across Latin America, while becoming the top film in Germany. The West Africa region saw a 7% increase, which resulted in the biggest three-day weekend ever there. Trinidad had the biggest opening weekend ever ($700,000) and the IMAX release in Russia ($1.7 million) was a February record for that country.[266]\n\nIn its third weekend, the film remained number one across many of its 56 territories, including the entire Latin America region,[267] while its opening in Japan was the top Western film for the weekend, the second overall.[267][268] In its fourth weekend, Black Panther opened in China ($66.5 million) with the fourth-highest MCU and superhero opening ever in the country. This included the biggest opening day and opening weekend ($7.3 million) of March for IMAX in China. The film also remained at number one in the United Kingdom and the Latin America region (except Argentina) for the fourth straight weekend, as well as number one in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.[269] Black Panther was the top film in South Africa for seven weeks,[270] where it became the highest-grossing film ever.[271] It also became the highest-grossing film of all time in West and East Africa, and the southern Africa region,[267][272] and the highest-grossing superhero film ever in the Netherlands.[228] As of April 8, 2018[update], the film's largest markets were China ($104.6 million), the United Kingdom ($67.7 million), and South Korea ($42.8 million).[273] It became the fifth-highest-grossing MCU film of all time in other territories.[271]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 96%, with an average score of 8.3/10, based on 532 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Black Panther elevates superhero cinema to thrilling new heights while telling one of the MCU's most absorbing stories—and introducing some of its most fully realized characters.\"[275] As of February 18, 2018[update], it was the best-reviewed live-action superhero film on the site, beating The Dark Knight (2008) and Iron Man (both 94%).[276] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100 based on 55 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[277] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale, the second live-action superhero film to receive that grade after Marvel's The Avengers. Filmgoers polled by comScore's PostTrak service gave the film a 95% positive score and an 88% \"definite recommend\", with a third of people planning to see the film again.[202][250] RelishMix reported that the use of Twitter hashtags for #BlackPanther and tagging of the film's Twitter account from those leaving the theater was the highest for a film's opening weekend, with 559,000 unique posts in one day (100,000 posts for a film is average).[202] Black Panther was listed on many critics' top ten lists as a top film of 2018.[278]\n\nCritics called Black Panther one of the best standalone Marvel films,[279] one of the best Marvel origin films,[280] one of the best superhero films of the century,[281] and a \"refreshing answer to the increasingly stale world of superhero cinema\".[282] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it unlike any other Marvel film, \"an exhilarating triumph on every level from writing, directing, acting, production design, costumes, music, special effects to you name it\".[283] Jamelle Bouie put the film in the same league as Superman (1978), Spider-Man 2 (2004), and The Dark Knight, superhero films that do not \"transcend the genre as much as they embrace it in all its respects\". Bouie concluded, \"Black Panther could have been just another Marvel romp [but] Coogler and company had the power, and perhaps the responsibility, to do much more. And they did.\"[284] The cast was acclaimed.[281][280] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter stated Boseman \"certainly holds his own, but there are quite a few charismatic supporting players\" including Jordan, Nyong'o, and Wright.[285]\n\nThe writing was praised for its handling of themes of Africans. Manohla Dargis honored Black Panther as an \"emblem of a past that was denied and a future that feels very present\" due to its focus on Black imagination, creation, and liberation.[286] At the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan praised the themes of the film and their exploration of what wealthy countries owe to the poor and oppressed, and noted that the film \"draws energy from Coogler's sense of excitement at all he's attempting\", saying that the film was worth seeing twice which he felt was rare for a modern superhero film.[287] Richard Roeper, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, said audiences should watch the film if they appreciate \"finely honed storytelling with a Shakespearean core; winning performances from an enormously talented ensemble; provocative premises touching on isolationism, revolution and cultures of oppression, and oh yeah, tons of whiz-bang action sequences and good humor\".[281] Brian Truitt of USA Today stated, \"While the themes are deep, Black Panther is at the same time a visual joy to behold, with confident quirkiness, insane action sequences and special effects, and the glorious reveal of Wakanda\".[280]\n\nNatasha Alford of The Grio called the film a \"movement, a revolution in progress, and a joy to experience all wrapped into one\", and called it \"a master class in what it means to be proud of who you are\".[288] Jamie Broadnax of Black Girl Nerds called the film a masterpiece that is \"afro-futuristic and Blackity-black as hell. It's everything I've ever desired in a live-action version of this popular superhero and yet so much more.\"[289] Bouie said, \"it is fair to say that Black Panther is the most political movie ever produced by Marvel Studios, both in its very existence... and in the questions its story raises.\"[284] Devindra Hardawar at Engadget was critical of the CGI, notably the digital actors used, calling them \"weightless, ugly and, worst of all, incredibly distracting\". Hardawar felt two \"particularly disappointing\" CGI shots were when T'Challa flips over a car during the Korea chase, and when T'Challa and Killmonger punch each other as they fall within the vibranium mines.[282]\n\nMany have wondered why Black Panther means so much to the Black community and why schools, churches and organizations have come to the theaters with so much excitement. The answer is that the movie brings a moment of positivity to a group of people often not the centerpiece of Hollywood movies... [Racial and ethnic socialization] helps to strengthen identity and helps reduce the likelihood on internalizing negative stereotypes about one's ethnic group.\n\nWriting for Time, Jamil Smith felt Black Panther would \"prove to Hollywood that African-American narratives have the power to generate profits from all audiences\", and described it as a resistance to \"a regressive cultural and political moment fueled in part by the white-nativist movement... Its themes challenge institutional bias, its characters take unsubtle digs at oppressors, and its narrative includes prismatic perspectives on Black life and tradition.\"[291] Discussing the film as a defining moment for Black America in The New York Times Magazine, Carvell Wallace said that in contrast to earlier Black superhero films, Black Panther \"is steeped very specifically and purposefully in its Blackness\". He felt Wakanda would become a \"promised land\" for future generations of Black Americans, \"untroubled by the criminal horrors of our [current] American existence.\"[292] Historian Nathan D. B. Connolly said Black Panther was \"a powerful fictional analogy for real-life struggles\" that taps into a \"500-year history of African-descended people imagining freedom, land and national autonomy.\" Connolly also felt, culturally, the film would be this generation's A Raisin in the Sun (1961).[293] Writer and activist Shaun King found the film to be a cultural moment in American Black history similar to Rosa Parks' Montgomery bus boycott, Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech, or Barack Obama being elected president.[294]\n\nBy contrast, James Wilt, writing for Canadian Dimension, stated that \"at its core, Black Panther contains a fundamentally reactionary understanding of Black liberation that blatantly advocates respectability politics over revolution\" allowing \"white folks such as myself to feel extremely comfortable watching it\". Wilt found the scene where Ross is portrayed as \"the hero\" for shooting down the Wakandan ships to be the film's way of approving the vanquishing of armed resistance against oppression. Wilt also felt that Killmonger was given the \"most hideous traits imaginable [making] the only major African-American character and agitator for revolution a manic killer consumed by rage and violence\".[295] Russell Rickford of Africa is a Country wrote that Killmonger's role as a character is \"to discredit radical internationalism\".[296] Faisal Kutty from Middle East Eye felt the film had underlying Islamophobic themes, with the only Islamic characters being a Boko Haram-based group that kidnapped several girls and forced them to wear hijab.[297]\n\nScience & Entertainment Exchange Director for the National Academy of Sciences Richard Loverd felt the film would increase interest in science, technology, and Africa for young Black Americans, similarly to how The Hunger Games films and Brave (2012) sparked girls' interest in archery.[130] Broadnax felt many people who generally do not watch comic book films would go to Black Panther since \"they're going to see themselves reflected in a huge way that they just haven't been able to see before\",[298] especially since the film avoided the plight typically depicted in films about the Black experience.[292] She also stated that the strong female characters, such as Shuri, would be an inspiration for girls.[298]\n\nGil Robertson, co-founder and president of the African American Film Critics Association, called the film \"critically important\" and \"a gate-opener opportunity for other Black-centered projects\".[298] In 2022, producer and actress Viola Davis credited the film for helping her film The Woman King (2022) get made.[299] Child development expert Deborah Gilboa felt the film would \"make a huge impact on children's spirits\" by offering positive role models.[300] Scholar Marlene D. Allen felt the saying \"if you can see it, you can be it\" applied to the film, especially with the female characters in the film. Allen felt the women of Wakanda \"are the very definition of 'Black Girl Magic', a term coined by CaShawn Thompson in 2013 'to celebrate the beauty, power, and resilience of Black women.'\"[301] Tre Johnson of Rolling Stone felt that \"after decades of trying to nail the modern Black superhero, we may finally be getting what we've asked for\", with Johnson saying Black Panther felt different from the Blaxploitation films of the 1970s and the \"Blaxploitation-lite\" attempts at Black superhero films in the 1990s and 2000s because it was \"respectable, imaginative and powerful\", setting \"a new direction\" for the depiction of Black superheroes.[192] In the film's opening weekend, 37% of audiences in the United States were African-American, according to PostTrak, compared to 35% Caucasian, 18% Hispanic, and 5% Asian.[202] This was the most diverse audience for a superhero film ever (African-Americans generally make up 15% of audiences for superhero films).[194] In its second weekend, demographics were 37% Caucasian, 33% African American, 18% Hispanic and 7% Asian.[250]\n\nIn early January 2018, philanthropist Frederick Joseph created a GoFundMe drive to raise money for children of color at the Boys & Girls Club in Harlem to see Black Panther.[302] Joseph said the film was a \"rare opportunity\" for underserved children of color to see \"a Black major ... comic book character\" brought to film.[300] Joseph promoted the drive with Boseman on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. The drive went on to raise over $45,000,[303] exceeding its goal,[302] with the money also funding other programs for children in Harlem.[303] Joseph also started the \"Black Panther Challenge\" where he encouraged other people to create similar drives for their communities.[302] GoFundMe made a centralized site for those wishing to start a drive for the challenge.[304] 400 additional drives were started around the world, and the overall drive became the largest GoFundMe in history for an entertainment event, raising over $400,000.[202] Many celebrities offered their support and contributions to the drives,[302] including Ellen DeGeneres, Snoop Dogg, Chelsea Clinton, J. J. Abrams,[303] Octavia Spencer,[305] and British actress Jade Anouka.[303]\n\nIn June 2018, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African American History and Culture announced they had acquired several items from the film for their collection, including Boseman's Black Panther costume and a shooting script for the film signed by Coogler, Feige, Moore, and Cole. The museum said that the collection provides a \"fuller story of Black culture and identity\" by showing the progression of Black Americans in film, \"an industry that [once] regulated them to flat, one-dimensional and marginalized figures.\"[306] In conjunction with The Hollywood Reporter's Women in Entertainment Mentorship Program, and its partner the Greater Los Angeles chapter of Big Brothers Big Sisters, Walt Disney Studios created \"The Black Panther Scholarship\", worth US$250,000 to Loyola Marymount University. Boseman, Nyong'o, and Gurira presented the scholarship to its first recipient at The Hollywood Reporter's 2018 Women in Entertainment event in early December 2018.[307]\n\nDwayne Wong (Omowale) writing in HuffPost saw the film and its comic origins as addressing \"serious political issues concerning Africa's relationship to the West that is very rarely given the serious attention that it deserves\", with Wakandans portrayed as suspicious towards outsiders. He concluded that while the country is fictional, the politics \"are very real. The end of colonialism did not end Western tampering in Africa's politics\".[308] Carlos Rosario Gonzalez of Bam! Smack! Pow! said the struggle between T'Challa and Killmonger represents the collision of \"what it means to be African\" and \"what Africa means to Afro-minorities today\". In this view, Wakanda represents Africa without Western colonialism, and Killmonger shows us that \"we can sometimes inevitably become what we seek to destroy,\" concluding that Killmonger wants to use Wakanda's resources to become a colonizer of the West while \"Wakanda's conservative ways created the very problem that sought to destroy them, Erik Killmonger\".[309] Jelani Cobb, writing in The New Yorker, discussed the divide between Africans and African Americans, which he called a \"fundamental dissonance\". He felt T'Challa and Killmonger represented \"dueling responses to five centuries of African exploitation at the hands of the West. The villain, to the extent that the term applies, is history itself\". Cobb added that Black Panther is political in a way previous MCU films were not because in those \"we were at least clear about where the lines of fantasy departed from reality [while this film is set in] in an invented nation in Africa, a continent that has been grappling with invented versions of itself ever since white men first declared it the 'dark continent' and set about plundering its people and its resources.\"[310] Writing for The Atlantic, Adam Serwer argued against the assertion that Erik Killmonger was a representation for Black liberation, positing instead that he represented imperialism. He felt that this was emphasized through his actions, as Killmonger's attempts to take over several of the world's major cities notably include Hong Kong. Since China does not have a white Western hegemony in need of overthrowing, Killmonger's desire to conquer China was purely for the sake of power. Ultimately, he argues that \"Black Panther does not render a verdict that violence is an unacceptable tool of Black liberation—to the contrary, that is precisely how Wakanda is liberated. It renders a verdict on imperialism as a tool of Black liberation, to say that the master's tools cannot dismantle the master's house.\"[311]\n\nPatrick Gathara, writing in The Washington Post, described the film as offering a \"regressive, neocolonial vision of Africa\", which—rather than a \"redemptive counter-mythology\"—offers \"the same destructive myths\". Gathara highlighted the Africa that is portrayed, still essentially a European creation, as being divided and tribalized, with Wakanda run by a wealthy and feuding elite that despite its advanced technical abilities does not have a means of succession beyond lethal combat. The Wakandans \"still cleanly fit into the Western molds [of] a dark people in a dark continent\" according to Gathara, and they \"remain so remarkably unsophisticated that a 'returning' American can basically stroll in and take over ... [The film] should not be mistaken for an attempt at liberating Africa from Europe. Quite the opposite. Its 'redemptive counter-mythology' entrenches the tropes that have been used to dehumanize Africans for centuries.\"[312] Christopher Lebron, in a piece for Boston Review, called the film racist because it depicts Black Americans who had been left in poverty and oppression, as exemplified by Killmonger, as still being \"relegated to the lowest rung of political regard\" in the film, treated as less deserving of empathy and less capable of their acts being deemed heroic, than even Ross's white spy. Lebron felt that T'Challa could have shown himself a good person by understanding how Killmonger was affected by American racism and T'Chaka's \"cruelty\", and could have agreed that justice sometimes requires violence as a last resort against oppression. He summed up by commenting that \"In 2018, a world home to both the Movement for Black Lives and a president [Donald Trump] who identifies white supremacists as fine people, we are given a movie about Black empowerment where the only redeemed Blacks are African nobles [who] safeguard virtue and goodness against the threat not of white Americans or Europeans, but a Black American\".[313]\n\nAt the 91st Academy Awards, Black Panther received nominations for Best Picture, Best Original Song, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing; and won Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Original Score.[314] The film's other nominations include a British Academy Film Award (which it won),[315] twelve Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning three),[316] and three Golden Globe Awards.[317] Its nominations for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama were firsts for a superhero film,[318][319] while its Academy Award wins were the first for Marvel Studios and an MCU film.[320] The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Black Panther one of the ten-best films of 2018.[321][322] The film was the top entertainment Google Search of 2018 along with the sixth overall.[323] In December 2021, its screenplay was listed number fifty-seven on the Writers Guild of America's \"101 Greatest Screenplays of the 21st Century (So Far)\".[324]\n\nBy late August 2018, Disney hired Academy Award campaign strategist Cynthia Swartz to create a nomination campaign on behalf of the film for the 91st Academy Awards, with Feige and Marvel Studios said to have given the film a noteworthy budget for the awards season, an obligation which Marvel didn't consider for previous films. The campaign was focused to highlight \"the film's creative accomplishments and the global impact it made\" in the hopes of receiving a Best Picture nomination; the campaign was not altered with the announcement of the new Best Popular Film award, which appeared to be \"designed to reward blockbusters like Black Panther\" in the event they did not receive a Best Picture nomination.[325] The Best Popular Film award was ultimately not implemented for the 91st Academy Awards, in order for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to \"examine and seek additional input regarding\" it.[326][327] Glenn Whipp of the Los Angeles Times felt the \"blueprint\" for the film's Best Picture campaign was to \"communicate to Oscar voters that this is an auteur-driven superhero movie possessing a deep significance both to its director and to people historically underrepresented in Hollywood films.\" Another Oscar campaign consultant felt reminding the Oscar voters Black Panther \"wasn't just a movie, it was a phenomenon\" would help the film earn a nomination. Another said voters \"want to reward good movies and they also want to reward movies that say something significant and make the industry look good.\" The consultants also felt if Black Panther could earn multiple nominations in the craft award categories, it would bolster its chances for a Best Picture nomination; Whipp believed that Morrison, Beachler, Carter, Friend and Harlow, and Lamar all had the possibility to be nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Original Song, respectively.[325] A few weeks later, Disney revealed their For Your Consideration list, with consideration in all Awards of Merit categories, aside from Best Actress and categories it was not eligible for, such as those for animation, short films, and documentaries.[328][329]\n\nBlack Panther was ultimately nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Original Score, Best Original Song (for \"All the Stars\"), Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing.[330] The film was the first superhero film ever to be nominated for Best Picture,[318] while Beachler's nomination for Best Production Design was the first for an African American.[331] Feige called the Best Picture nomination \"the highest form of recognition from our peers\".[318] On her nomination, Beachler said she felt \"a certain responsibility. It means breaking down walls ... for young women of color and boys and girls of color to see that this is not impossible.\"[331]\n\nA sequel, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, was released on November 11, 2022,[332] with Coogler returning to write and direct.[333] Nyong'o,[334] Gurira,[335] Freeman,[336] Wright,[337] Duke, and Bassett reprise their roles, while Tenoch Huerta was cast as Namor.[334] In August 2020, Boseman died from colon cancer; Coogler, Feige, and  executives at Marvel Studios had been unaware of Boseman's illness.[338][339] Feige stated in December 2020 that the role of T'Challa would not be recast,[340] with Shuri expected to have a more prominent role in the sequel.[334]\n\nBy November 2024, Coogler had had discussions with Denzel Washington about casting him for a role in a third film.[341] The next month, Moore announced plans to exit his role at Marvel Studios in March 2025 to pursue producing outside the studio, though he would return to produce Black Panther 3 along with Marvel Studios.[342]\n\nIn December 2023, Marvel Studios Animation announced Eyes of Wakanda,[343] an animated series created in collaboration with Coogler's production company Proximity Media. In May 2024, Todd Harris was revealed to have created the series, and he serves as the director. He previously served as a storyboard artist at Marvel Studios.[344][345][346] Eyes of Wakanda is scheduled to premiere on Disney+ on August 6, 2025,[347] and will consist of four episodes.[348] The series tells the story of Wakandan warriors, the Hatut Zaraze, who carry out dangerous missions around the world to retrieve vibranium artifacts throughout history, and features an ensemble cast.[349]\n\nIn February 2021, a drama series set in Wakanda was revealed to be in development from Coogler for Disney+, as part of the larger overall deal between Coogler's production company Proximity Media and Walt Disney Television.[350] By May 2021, Gurira had signed a deal to reprise her role as Okoye in the series, which was said to be an origin spin-off for the character.[351][352] In January 2023, Gurira confirmed there had been discussions surrounding an Okoye-led series.[353]\n"

        "content": "\n\nAvengers: Infinity War is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to The Avengers (2012) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and the 19th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldaña, Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt. In the film, the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy attempt to stop Thanos from collecting the six powerful Infinity Stones as part of his quest to kill half of all life in the universe.\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1. The Russo brothers came on board to direct in April 2015, and a month later, Markus and McFeely signed on to write the script for the film, which draws inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 comic book The Infinity Gauntlet and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 comic book Infinity. In 2016, Marvel shortened the title to Avengers: Infinity War. Filming began in January 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with a large cast consisting mostly of actors reprising their roles from previous MCU films, including Brolin as Thanos. The production lasted until July 2017, shooting back-to-back with a direct sequel, Avengers: Endgame (2019). Additional filming took place in Scotland, the Downtown Atlanta area, and New York City. With an estimated budget of $325–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 23, 2018, and was released in the United States on April 27, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for Brolin's performance and the Russo brothers' direction, as well as the visual effects, action sequences, dark tone, emotional weight and musical score. It was a major box-office success, being the fourth film and the first superhero film to gross over $2 billion worldwide, breaking numerous box office records, and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2018 and the fourth-highest-grossing film at the time of its release both worldwide and in the United States and Canada. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 91st Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. The sequel, Avengers: Endgame, was released in April 2019.\n\nHaving acquired the Power Stone—one of six Infinity Stones—from the planet Xandar, Thanos and his lieutenants—Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima Midnight, and Corvus Glaive—intercept the spaceship carrying the survivors of Asgard's destruction.[a] After subduing Thor, Thanos extracts the Space Stone from the Tesseract, overpowers the Hulk, and kills Loki and Heimdall. A dying Heimdall sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifröst. Thanos and his lieutenants leave, destroying the ship.\n\nHulk crash-lands in the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to the form of Bruce Banner. He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos's plan to destroy half of all life in the universe, and they recruit Tony Stark. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing Peter Parker's attention. Maw, unable to take the Time Stone due to Strange's enchantment, captures him. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship while Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy respond to the Asgardian ship's distress call and rescue Thor. Thor surmises that Thanos is after the Reality Stone, which Taneleer Tivan possesses on Knowhere. He travels with Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir to enlist the dwarf king Eitri's aid in creating the battle-axe Stormbreaker. Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis travel to Knowhere, finding Thanos already has the Reality Stone. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, who discloses the Soul Stone's location to save Nebula from torture. On Vormir, the Stone's keeper, Red Skull, tells Thanos that he can only acquire it by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, earning the Stone.\n\nMidnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision in Edinburgh to retrieve the Mind Stone in Vision's forehead. Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson rescue them and they take shelter with James Rhodes and Banner at the Avengers Compound. Vision asks Wanda to destroy him and the Mind Stone to keep it from Thanos, but Wanda refuses. The group travels to Wakanda, which Rogers believes has the resources to remove the Stone without killing Vision.\n\nNebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos's destroyed homeworld, Titan. Stark and Parker kill Maw and rescue Strange. The trio crash-lands on Titan, where they meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. Using the Time Stone, Strange views millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which the Avengers win. The group formulates a plan to subdue Thanos and remove the Infinity Gauntlet, with which he safely houses and wields the Stones. Thanos appears, justifying his plans as necessary to guarantee the survival of an overpopulated universe. Nebula arrives soon after and helps the others subdue Thanos, but deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks Thanos, allowing him to break the group's hold and overpower them. Thanos grievously wounds Stark, but Strange offers the Time Stone in exchange for sparing Stark's life.\n\nIn Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes before Thanos' army invades. The Avengers, along with T'Challa and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense while Shuri works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Unable to summon the Hulk, Banner fights in Stark's Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers. Together they kill Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive, and rout Thanos's army. Shuri cannot complete the extraction before Thanos arrives on the field; the Avengers and their allies fail to stop him from reaching Vision. Vision convinces a reluctant Wanda to destroy him and the Mind Stone, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse her actions, rip the stone from Vision's forehead, and complete the Gauntlet. Thor severely wounds Thanos with Stormbreaker, but Thanos activates the completed Gauntlet by snapping his fingers before teleporting away.\n\nHalf of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Wanda, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, Parker, Maria Hill, and Nick Fury, the last of whom sends an emergency signal on a modified pager before disintegrating.[b] Stark and Nebula remain stranded on Titan while Banner, M'Baku, Okoye, Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left on the Wakandan battlefield. Meanwhile, Thanos watches a sunrise on a remote planet.\n\nAdditionally, several other actors reprise their MCU roles: Danai Gurira as Okoye, the head of the Dora Milaje;[65] Letitia Wright as T'Challa's sister Shuri;[66] William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, the U.S. Secretary of State;[67] Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's AI F.R.I.D.A.Y.;[68] Winston Duke as M'Baku, the leader of Wakanda's mountain tribe the Jabari; Florence Kasumba as Ayo, a member of the Dora Milaje;[69] Jacob Batalon as Parker's friend Ned;[70] Isabella Amara as Parker's classmate Sally;[71] Tiffany Espensen as Parker's classmate Cindy; and Ethan Dizon as Parker's classmate Tiny.[72] Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders make uncredited cameos as Nick Fury and Maria Hill, the former director and deputy director of S.H.I.E.L.D., respectively, in the film's post-credits scene.[73]\n\nThanos' henchmen, known collectively in the comics as the Black Order and in the film as the \"Children of Thanos\",[74] include Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian,[75][76] Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw,[77][78] Carrie Coon as Proxima Midnight,[76] and Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive.[79] The foursome provided voices and motion-capture performances on set for their characters.[80][79] As Coon was pregnant during filming, she mainly did facial capture for Proxima Midnight with some motion-capture,[81] with stuntwoman Monique Ganderton standing-in and providing the rest on set.[72] Ebony Maw's look was inspired by the Marvel Comics character Mephisto, who appeared in the Infinity Gauntlet storyline.[82]\n\nRoss Marquand voices Johann Schmidt / Red Skull, the \"Stonekeeper\" and former Nazi commander of Hydra during World War II.[40][83][84] Marquand replaces Hugo Weaving, who had expressed reluctance to reprise the character from Captain America: The First Avenger (2011).[40][83] Red Skull was created through CGI and portrayed with stand-ins on set.[84] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance in the film as Parker's school bus driver,[40] while screenwriter Stephen McFeely cameos as Secretary Ross' aide.[85] Kenneth Branagh, the director of Thor (2011), voices an Asgardian distress caller in an uncredited cameo.[86] David Cross was invited to make a cameo appearance as Tobias Fünke, his character from the television sitcom Arrested Development, which the Russo brothers had previously worked on; this was prevented by a scheduling conflict, but Fünke still appears in the film as a specimen in the Collector's collection, played by an uncredited extra.[87] Executive producer Jon Favreau was to reprise his role as Happy Hogan, while co-director Joe Russo had a cameo appearance as a paparazzi photographer, but this scene did not make the theatrical cut of the film.[88]\n\nIn October 2014, Marvel Studios announced a two-part sequel to Avengers: Age of Ultron, titled Avengers: Infinity War. Part 1 was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with Part 2 scheduled for May 3, 2019.[89] Marvel's plan was to film both parts of Infinity War back-to-back.[90] Anthony and Joe Russo were hired as directors of these films in April 2015.[91] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film,[92] which drew inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 The Infinity Gauntlet comic and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 Infinity comic.[93] Anthony Russo added the film was inspired by 1990s heist films, with Thanos \"on a smash-and-grab\" to acquire all of the Infinity Stones.[56] Producer Kevin Feige said these were titled as two parts of a single film because of the shared elements between them, but he felt they would be \"two distinct\" projects, not one story split across two films.[94] The Russos decided in May 2016 to retitle the two films to remove this misconception;[95] Marvel simply shortened the first as Avengers: Infinity War that July.[96]\n\nPrincipal photography began on January 23, 2017,[97] under the working title Mary Lou,[98] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[99] with Trent Opaloch as director of photography.[100] Infinity War, along with Avengers: Endgame, were shot using ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.[101] In early February, Marvel confirmed the involvement of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the film.[8] Additional filming took place in Scotland beginning in February 2017. The filming occurred in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and the Scottish Highlands,[102] with studio work taking place at Wardpark Studios in Cumbernauld.[103] In late June 2017, filming occurred in Downtown Atlanta,[104] as well as Atlanta's Central Park in early July,[105] before moving to Queens, New York in the middle of the month.[106] Filming concluded on July 14, 2017.[107] For the film's final scene, where Thanos settles in a nipa hut, the filmmakers worked with Thailand-based studio Indochina Productions to acquire footage of the Banaue Rice Terraces at Ifugao, Philippines.[108]\n\nLater in July 2017, Joe Russo stated there were a couple of unfinished scenes for Infinity War that would be shot \"in the next few months\".[109] In early March 2018, Disney moved the release of Infinity War in the United States to April 27, 2018, to have it be released the same weekend as some of its international markets.[110][111] Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic,[112] Framestore,[113] Method Studios,[114] Weta Digital, DNEG, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, and Perception.[115] With an estimated budget in the range of $325–400 million,[2][3] it is one of the most expensive films ever made.[116] Evans and Hemsworth both earned $15 million for the film.[117]\n\nIn June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for The Avengers, was revealed to be returning to score both Infinity War and Endgame.[118] Silvestri recorded his score from January 2018[119] to late March, and found working on the film to be \"a really different experience than anything I'd done before, especially in regard to the approach and balancing quick shifts in tone\".[120] Ludwig Göransson's theme from Black Panther is used in the film.[121] Hollywood Records and Marvel Music released regular and deluxe soundtrack albums digitally on April 27, 2018, with physical releases on May 18. The deluxe edition featured some extended and additional tracks.[122]\n\nIn May 2017, Robert Downey Jr. and his philanthropic organization Random Act Funding partnered with Omaze for a contest in which a randomly chosen winner from those that donated would receive an Infinity War set visit.[123] A life-sized statue of Thanos, created by Legacy Effects, was on display at D23 Expo 2017,[124] alongside statues of the Black Order / \"Children of Thanos\": Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw, and Cull Obsidian.[74] Additionally, Feige, Joe Russo, Downey, Brolin, Bettany, Olsen, Klementieff, Gillan, Bautista, Cheadle, Mackie, Cumberbatch, Stan, Holland, Boseman, Ruffalo, and Hemsworth appeared at D23 Expo to present a clip highlighting the 10 years of MCU films, along with footage from Infinity War.[28] The footage, which was screened exclusively for the panel,[125] received strong audience reaction, with fans \"literally on their feet and jumping as the footage played\".[125][126] Julia Alexander of Polygon said there was \"quite a bit happening\" in the footage and it \"finally feels like Marvel has made the movie it always wanted to—and the one we've always wanted to see.\"[126] CinemaBlend's Eric Eisenberg said the footage left him \"literally shaking\", with the film looking \"like it could be one of the most epic blockbusters ever created\".[127] Haleigh Foutch for Collider described it as \"dark and dramatic, and utterly epic. It's clear Marvel is trying to do something different here [...] to pay off a decade's worth of narrative and world-building. While it's impossible to tell from two minutes work of footage, it certainly looks like that gamble paid off\".[128] The D23 footage was also shown at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con.[129] After the two convention presentations, Avengers: Infinity War generated over 90,000 new conversations on social media from July 17 to 23, the third-most during that time period behind Thor: Ragnarok and Justice League (2017), according to Comscore and its PreAct service.[130] Infinity War stayed in third the following week, with over 41,000 new social media conversations, behind Ragnarok and It (2017).[131] By the week of October 16, Infinity War had generated over 679,000 total social media conversations.[132]\n\nTo promote the film's first teaser trailer, Marvel released a compilation video of some of its previous trailers since Iron Man (2008), \"paired with fan reaction videos to those trailers\".[133] The first teaser for Avengers: Infinity War debuted on Good Morning America on November 29, 2017.[134] Josh Spiegel of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"The most important part of the trailer is how it carefully, deliberately introduces the notion that the Infinity War films are going to function as a passing of the torch, from one set of Avengers to a newer group\".[135] Scott Mendelson, writing for Forbes, noted that even though the trailer was not much different from the convention footage screened earlier in the year, it was \"damn impressive.\" Additionally, the trailer had an \"excellent effect\", using the \"Avengers Initiative speech\" by Nick Fury and the \"Avengers theme\" by Alan Silvestri from The Avengers.[136] Conversely to Mendelson, Alexander commented on the different marketing strategy for the film between the convention footage scenes and the trailer scenes, feeling the \"two couldn't be more different\". She said the convention footage (intended to please the crowd who were \"jittery with anticipation\") was released between Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Thor: Ragnarok, and heavily focused Thor and the Guardians, while the trailer (designed to explain the film to general audiences) heavily features Black Panther and Wakanda, which Alexander said could not have been done before the additional marketing for Black Panther that happened after the conventions provided additional context.[137] Gael Cooper of CNET observed that the trailer was viewed nearly 500,000 times in its first 15 minutes after it was posted on YouTube, but questioned if the trailer broke the site after the view counter appeared to be stuck at 467,331.[138] The trailer was viewed 230 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of It.[139]\n\nIn January 2018, Marvel Comics published a two-issue prequel comic titled Avengers: Infinity War Prelude, which serves as a bridge between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War.[140] A commercial for Infinity War aired during Super Bowl LII, and generated the most social media buzz of all the films advertised according to comScore and United Talent Agency; it was viewed 17.6 million times across YouTube and Facebook.[141] On February 27, Disney and Marvel announced the \"Marvel: The Universe Unites\" charity campaign leading to the release of merchandise for the film on March 3. The week-long event saw stars from the film create social media challenges to provide funds and raise awareness for charities that support children and families impacted by serious illness. Marvel planned to make a $250,000 donation to Starlight Children's Foundation if these posts collectively reached 1 million likes, while Disney planned to donate 10% of all Marvel's Disney Store sales in the United States and online on the weekend of March 3 to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, up to $50,000. Hasbro and Funko each donated $1 million worth of cash and products, to Give Kids the World Village and Starlight Children's Foundation, respectively.[142]\n\nA second trailer was released on March 16, which earned over 1 million views on YouTube in less than three hours after it was released.[143] Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post was not overly enthused about another superhero film having \"special-effects-heavy villains, or the sight of yet another mysterious object hanging over the Manhattan skyline\", but felt the trailer made her realize \"that I'm actually looking forward to seeing [the characters of the MCU] get to know each other\".[144] Spiegel agreed with Rosenberg about the potential for character interactions, but felt it was \"gimmicky\" to have so many \"crossover-style introductions or combinations of heroes in a movie like this\".[145] The second trailer was viewed 179 million times in the first 24 hours, the third-most viewed trailer in that time period, behind the first trailer for the film and It, while also becoming the biggest release for a second trailer, surpassing Beauty and the Beast (2017) (128 million views).[146] A week before the film's release, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai was lit up each night for the film, counting down to its release.[147] Marvel also featured tie-in events across seven of their mobile games to promote the film.[148] In early May, Marvel and Epic Games announced the \"Infinity Gauntlet Limited Time Mashup\" mode for Fortnite Battle Royale, where players could find the Infinity Gauntlet hidden on the game map and become Thanos with added abilities. The Russo brothers were fans of Fortnite and approached Donald Mustard, the worldwide creative director of Epic Games, about the potential for a crossover between the properties.[149] On November 20, Little, Brown and Company published Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War: Thanos – Titan Consumed, written by Barry Lyga. Despite not existing within Marvel Studios' MCU canon, the novel explores the origins of Thanos before the events of the film. Lyga spoke with Marvel Studios to get an \"outline of who Thanos is and what he means to the movies\", and \"was given great latitude and a free hand [in some areas of the story], while in others I had to tip-toe very carefully through the MCU\".[150]\n\nAll-in-all, the studio spent an estimated $150 million on prints and advertisements promoting the film.[2] Additional marketing partners for the film included Coca-Cola, Quicken Loans and their Rocket Mortgage service, the Infiniti QX50 (which appears in the film), Ziploc, Go-Gurt, Yoplait, Synchrony Bank, American Airlines, and Stand Up to Cancer. The partners created television commercials \"inspired by or featuring the film's characters and themes\", interactive digital initiatives, and robust in-store presences at numerous retailers. Duracell, Unilever, Quaker Oats Company, Chevron, and Samsung ran promotions in smaller markets. Coca-Cola, Ziploc, Go-Gurt, and Yoplait created special packaging in support of the film, with Synchrony implementing a \"Save Like a Hero\" campaign, and Stand Up to Cancer and American Airlines launching a national campaign with a PSA starring Johansson and Hemsworth. In the United Kingdom, OnePlus released an Infinity War edition for one of their smartphones. Deadline Hollywood estimated the media value was $150 million, the largest for any Marvel film, with Coca-Cola contributing an estimated $40 million.[151]\n\nAvengers: Infinity War held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 23, 2018, screening also at the adjacent El Capitan Theatre and Grauman's Chinese Theatre.[152][153] It was released in most countries worldwide, including the United States, on April 27, with a few debuts beginning as early as April 25,[110] and was shown in IMAX and 3D on select screens.[154][155] In the United States, the film opened in 4,474 theaters, 408 of which were IMAX; this was the widest release for a Disney title ever and the second-widest ever after Despicable Me 3's (2017) 4,529 theaters. Three of AMC Theatres' locations screened the film for 24 hours straight, with 53 of their locations having showtimes at either 2 am or 3 am to accommodate demand.[156] In India, the film had the biggest release ever for a Hollywood film, opening on nearly 2,000 screens in four languages.[157] The film also screened in 515 4DX theaters in 59 countries.[158] Avengers: Infinity War was originally scheduled to be released on May 4 in the United States.[89] The Chinese release of the film, which opened on May 11,[159] was originally scheduled to end on June 10, but was granted a \"rare\" extension of 30 days, to end on July 9.[160] Avengers: Infinity War is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[161]\n\nSelect footage from the film was screened in various cities during the film's press tour in early April, ahead of the Los Angeles premiere. The Russos said only a limited amount of the film would be shown at these screenings to reduce the chance of spoilers being leaked. Adam Chitwood of Collider commented that this was \"highly unusual as most Marvel movies are screened in their entirety for press about a month before they hit theaters\".[162] Ahead of the United States release, AMC Theatres in New York City and Orlando, Florida aired an eleven-MCU film marathon beginning on April 25, ending in a screening of Infinity War. The El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles had a similar marathon for the film's release.[163]\n\nAvengers: Infinity War was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 31, 2018, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 14. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. The digital release also features a roundtable discussion between MCU directors the Russos, Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon, James Gunn, Ryan Coogler, Peyton Reed, and Taika Waititi.[164] In terms of home media sales, the physical versions of the film were collectively the top home media release of the week in which they were first released.[165]\n\nDespite being shot with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release did not present the film in that aspect ratio, instead including a cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio that was used for non-IMAX screenings.[166][167] Joe Russo said they \"spent a long time trying to\" have the IMAX version on the home media, but since the IMAX Corporation has \"agency over that format\", the situation was \"complicated\".[168] He did not rule out the possibility that this version could be available at a later point.[167] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[169]\n\nAvengers: Infinity War grossed $678.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.374 billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.052 billion,[4] becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time,[170][171] the highest-grossing film of 2018,[172] the highest-grossing MCU film, and the highest-grossing superhero film.[173]\n\nIts worldwide opening weekend of $640.5 million was the biggest of all time, beating The Fate of the Furious's (2017) $541.9 million.[156] It was later beat by its sequel, Avengers: Endgame, which grossed $1.222 billion in its opening weekend.[174]\nIt was the fastest film to make $1 billion at the worldwide box office, doing so in 11 days to eclipse Star Wars: The Force Awakens's (2015) record of 12 days.[175] Also, in its second weekend, Infinity War passed $13.5 million from 4DX screens, which was the all-time record for the format.[158] On June 12, 2018, Avengers: Infinity War passed the $2 billion mark at the worldwide box office, becoming the fourth film to cross that milestone after Avatar (2009), Titanic (1997), and The Force Awakens.[171] Crossing the mark in 48 days, it was the second-fastest to that point, after Avatar's 47-day record and later the 11-day record of Avengers: Endgame.[176] With $140 million worldwide from IMAX,[177] the film is the third-largest worldwide in the format, behind Avatar and The Force Awakens,[170] and the largest for a Marvel film.[178] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $500 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2018's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[2]\n\nIn December 2017, a survey from Fandango indicated that Infinity War was the most anticipated film of 2018.[179] Fandango later reported that Infinity War achieved the largest initial 24-hour ticket pre-sales for a superhero film, taking just 6 hours to surpass the previous 24-hour record set by Black Panther. Atom Tickets reported that Infinity War sold more tickets in its first pre-sales day than Black Panther sold in its first month.[180] Within 72 hours, the film generated the largest pre-sales for any superhero film at AMC Theatres, with its advance ticket sales being 257.6% ahead of Black Panther's, 751.5% ahead of Captain America: Civil War, and 1,106.5% ahead of Avengers: Age of Ultron during the same time frame.[181] Two weeks before its release, Fandango revealed that advance ticket sales for Infinity War were outpacing the last seven MCU films combined in the same timeframe, and had become the company's top April release. It was also on pace to become the top superhero film.[182] A week before the film released, The Wall Street Journal said the film had sold more than $50 million worth of advance tickets, behind only The Force Awakens and Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017),[183][156] with Fandango reporting that more than 2,500 showtimes had sold out. On Atom Tickets, Infinity War had the most pre-sale volume, selling 7% higher than The Last Jedi and 250% higher than Black Panther at the same point in their sales. Atom also reported that ticket sales for Infinity War were doubling daily the week of its release, the fastest rate of increase the service has seen for any MCU title.[156]\n\nAvengers: Infinity War earned $106.7 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada (including $39 million from Thursday night previews), for an opening weekend total of $258.2 million. The Thursday night preview earning was the best for an MCU film (beating Avengers: Age of Ultron's $27.6 million) and the fourth-best of all time, behind The Force Awakens ($57 million), The Last Jedi ($45 million), and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011) ($43.5 million). Fandango reported that $14 million of the $39 million came from ticket pre-sales from the company. The opening day gross was the second-best ever, behind The Force Awakens's $119.1 million; its Saturday gross of $83 million was the best-ever Saturday gross, beating Jurassic World's (2015) $69.6 million; and its Sunday gross of $69.2 million was the best-ever, beating The Force Awakens's $60.5 million. The total weekend gross became the highest-grossing opening weekend, beating The Force Awakens's $248 million. IMAX contributed $22.5 million to the opening weekend gross, which was the best opening for a Marvel film in the format and the third-biggest opening, behind The Force Awakens ($30 million) and The Last Jedi ($24.7 million). AMC reported that the film had the highest Friday and Saturday box office gross for a single title in the company's history, while Fandango reported that approximately $84 million worth of tickets were sold through the service, approximately 30%, which was the largest share of the weekend box office for any film in the company's history.[156] Avengers: Infinity War earned an additional $25 million the Monday after its opening weekend, which was the highest-grossing Monday in April, beating Furious 7 (2015) ($14 million), and the second-best Monday gross for an MCU film, after Black Panther ($40.1 million).[184] The next day, it earned $23.5 million, which was the highest-grossing Tuesday for an MCU film, beating Black Panther ($20.8 million), and the highest-grossing Tuesday in May, beating The Avengers ($17.6 million). It also tied The Force Awakens for the fastest to reach $300 million at five days.[185]\n\nThe film remained number one in its second weekend, earning $115.5 million, which was the second-best second weekend ever after The Force Awakens ($149.2 million). Infinity War also surpassed $400 million in the weekend, doing so in nine days, becoming the second fastest film to reach that mark, again after The Force Awakens's eight days.[158] In its third weekend, Infinity War remained number one at the box office, and became the second-fastest film to surpass $500 million, doing so in 15 days (behind The Force Awakens's 10 days). The weekend also saw its total domestic IMAX gross become $48.1 million, which was the highest for any MCU film.[173] The film's fourth weekend saw it come in second, behind Deadpool 2,[186] and in its fifth it finished third behind Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) and Deadpool 2.[187] By May 23, Infinity War surpassed $600 million, becoming the second-fastest film to do so in 26 days, after The Force Awakens (12 days).[188] It remained in the top ten through its ninth weekend.[189] In the United States and Canada, it went on to become the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time,[171] and the second-highest-grossing superhero film, behind Black Panther.[190]\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film earned $382.7 million from 52 markets, opening number one in all, and became the number two opening internationally, behind The Fate of the Furious ($444.2 million). IMAX contributed $18.5 million, which was the best opening outside of the US, Canada, and China, surpassing The Force Awakens ($17.5 million).[191] All-time opening weekend records were set in South Korea ($39.2 million), Mexico ($25.4 million), Brazil ($19.1 million), India (for a Western release, $18.6 million), the Philippines ($12.5 million), Thailand ($10 million), Indonesia ($9.6 million), Malaysia,[191] Hong Kong, Vietnam,[192] Central America, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and West Africa,[191] with many also setting opening day records.[193] France had the biggest superhero opening in the market with $17.7 million,[191] as did Denmark, Finland, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden. The United Kingdom earned $8.9 million, which was the biggest MCU opening day and third-highest opening day for a Disney film;[192] it would go on to earn $41.4 million for the weekend, which was the third-highest of all time and the second-highest Disney opening.[191] Argentina had the second-highest opening day of all time, while Germany had the best superhero film opening day of all time,[192] ultimately earning $14.7 million, which was the best superhero opening ever.[191] Many other European countries and the Middle East also broke superhero film records.[192] Japan had the second-biggest opening for an MCU film with $9 million, and Australia had the second-highest opening weekend ever, with $23.2 million.[191]\n\nAvengers: Infinity War remained number one in its 54 markets in its second weekend.[159] The $4.9 million opening day in Russia was the biggest of all time. However, there was some controversy with the film's release in that country. Originally, the Russian government ordered it to be released on May 11, but after a scandal the government made concessions and agreed to let it premiere on May 3 with a condition that on May 9, during the Victory Day, only Russian films would be played in the cinema theatres.[194] Infinity War was also the first film in Russia to sell more than 1 million tickets in a single day,[195] and went on to gross $17.6 million in the market, a new opening weekend record. IMAX contributed $2.2 million in the market, which was also an opening weekend record.[159] In its third weekend, the film remained number one in a majority of its markets. Infinity War opened in China to $200 million (RMB 1.266 billion), which was the second-highest opening weekend in local currency behind The Fate of the Furious ($184 million and RMB 1.352 million). IMAX contributed $20.5 million, which was the third-largest opening in China.[178] Infinity War also broke China's pre-sale record of 400 million yuan ($63 million).[196] In India, Infinity War became the first Hollywood film to earn over ₹2 billion net ($29.7 million),[197] and also became the highest-grossing MCU film in the United Kingdom.[198] In its sixth weekend, the film became the highest-grossing MCU film in Japan with $33 million.[199]\n\nThe film became the highest-grossing release ever in Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines, Central America, Bolivia, Venezuela, Latin America as a region, Mexico, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Malaysia, Singapore, India (for a Western release), Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand (for a Western release), and Mongolia,[159][178][170][177] the second-highest in the Asia-Pacific region (for a Western release), Hong Kong, and South Korea (for a Western release), and the third-highest in China (for a Western release). It is also the highest-grossing superhero film in many European countries, including the United Kingdom.[177] As of June 17, 2018[update], the film's top markets are China ($373.4 million), the United Kingdom ($95.7 million), and South Korea ($92.8 million).[200] The film is the third-highest-grossing film of all time in territories outside the United States and Canada.[171]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 85%, with an average score of 7.6/10, based on 492 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Avengers: Infinity War ably juggles a dizzying array of MCU heroes in the fight against their gravest threat yet, and the result is a thrilling, emotionally resonant blockbuster that (mostly) realizes its gargantuan ambitions.\"[202] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100 based on 54 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[203]\n\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter praised the writers' and directors' ability to balance the large cast of characters, saying they, \"under the supervision of Marvel Films maestro Kevin Feige, acknowledge the traffic jam of egos and play it for laughs\".[204] Owen Gleiberman of Variety concurred, stating, \"Infinity War is a brashly entertaining jamboree, structured to show off each hero or heroine and give them just enough to do, and to update their mythologies without making it all feel like homework\".[205] Rolling Stone's Peter Travers said the film is \"too much of a good thing\" and wrote, \"The Russo brothers have clearly never learned the concept that less is more. They've used the premise of an Avengers reunion to put on a fireworks explosion of action and laughs that won't quit\".[206] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times called it Marvel's \"biggest and most ambitious movie yet\", but concluded \"it's certainly not the best. However, there's plenty of action, humor and heart—and some genuinely effective dramatic moments\". Roeper went on to praise the film's cast and Josh Brolin in particular, whom he called \"the film's most interesting performance\".[207] Gleiberman called Brolin's motion capture performance \"supremely effective\" and said, \"Brolin infuses Thanos with his slit-eyed manipulative glower, so that the evil in this movie never feels less than personal\".[205] McCarthy wrote, \"Brolin's calm, considered reading of the character bestows this conquering beast with an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension, making him much more than a thick stick figure of a supervillain\".[204] Gleiberman also praised the film's action sequences, saying \"Infinity War brims with tensely spectacular combat sequences, even if the question of who's going to win each one has that extravagantly arbitrary could-Mighty-Mouse-beat-up-Superman? quality\".[205] McCarthy called the scale of the action \"astonishing\",[204] and Travers wrote, \"Avengers: Infinity War leaves viewers up in the air, feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes\".[206] Josh Spiegel, also of The Hollywood Reporter, said the film takes \"a cue from the ending of The Empire Strikes Back in its super-sized finale; this is the equivalent of Han Solo frozen in the carbonite, on steroids\".[208]\n\nA. O. Scott of The New York Times criticized the film's reliance on other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, \"Considered on its own, as a single, nearly 2-hour-40-minute movie, Avengers: Infinity War makes very little sense\", but conceded that it \"was never meant to be viewed or judged in isolation\".[209] Richard Brody of The New Yorker agreed, stating, \"The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\".[210] Stephanie Zacharek of Time said, \"[It] isn't really a beginning, but more of a middle or an end with a new piece of yarn attached. You need to have seen and internalized every one of the previous 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to fully get it\".[211] Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times called it a \"brisk, propulsive, occasionally rousing and borderline-gutsy continuation of a saga that finally and sensibly seems to be drawing to a close\", but called its ultimate bid for catharsis \"unsuccessful\" since the Marvel \"assembly line [is not stopped] from chugging ahead with its signature polished, mechanized efficiency\".[212] Scott also criticized the action sequences, calling them \"tedious and predictable\" and \"surely the most expensive parts of the movie, but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination\".[209] Likewise, Zacharek said, \"There's no pacing in Avengers: Infinity War. It's all sensation and no pulse. Everything is big, all of the time\".[211]\n\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale,[156] and those at PostTrak gave the film an 87% overall positive score and a 68% \"definite recommend\".[158] American YouTube personality Tony \"Nem\" Mitchell watched the film 103 times in theaters, a world record. When Mitchell's streak was gaining media awareness around his 44th viewing, he noted that IMAX reached out to give him 50 free tickets to continue the streak, and the Russo brothers invited him to Endgame's premiere.[213][214][215] Mitchell said this was the way he \"want[ed] to support Marvel and the Russo brothers\".[213] Seventeen-year-old Kieran Harvey from Staffordshire also watched the film in theaters 100 times. Harvey stated that he \"didn't plan on seeing it this many times it just sort of happened\" adding that Infinity War \"just felt so different to anything I've ever seen before, and I just love it so much so have been going as much as I can!\"[216]\n\nThe ending of the film sparked various Internet meme reactions,[217] including one referencing Spider-Man saying he does not feel good as he disintegrates, which was applied to other things.[218] The website, DidThanosKill.Me was created for fans to see if they would have been spared by Thanos or not.[219] The ending also spawned the creation of the Reddit subreddit, /r/thanosdidnothingwrong. A user within the subreddit suggested that half of the approximately 20,000 subscribers at the time be banned from the subreddit, in order to mimic the events of the film. After the community agreed to the measure, the moderators approached Reddit's administrators to see if the mass ban would even be possible. Once the administrators agreed to the random ban of half the subscribers, it was set to occur on July 9, 2018.[220] Notice of the impending ban made the subreddit's subscribers increase to over 700,000,[221] including both of the Russos who subscribed.[222] Ahead of the ban, Brolin posted a video saying \"Here we go, Reddit users,\" and ending it with a snap.[223] Over 60,000 people watched a live Twitch stream of the ban occurring, which lasted several hours.[221] The ban of over 300,000 accounts, which included Anthony Russo, was the largest in Reddit's history.[221][224] Those banned then gathered in the new subreddit, /r/inthesoulstone.[220][221] One Reddit user who participated described the ban as embodying \"the spirit of the Internet\" with people \"banding together, en masse, around something relatively meaningless but somehow decidedly awesome and hilarious\".[224] Andrew Tigani of Screen Rant said this showed \"how impactful the film has already become to pop culture. It is also a testament to how valuable fan interaction can be via social media\".[223]\n\nAt the 91st Academy Awards, Avengers: Infinity War received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[225] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award,[226] a British Academy Film Award,[227] and two Critics' Choice Awards,[228] among others. In 2020, Infinity War was ranked seventh in an Empire magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[229]\n\nAvengers: Endgame was released on April 26, 2019,[230] with the Russos returning to direct,[91] and Markus and McFeely once again writing the screenplay.[92]\n"

        "content": "\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp is a 2018 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the characters Scott Lang / Ant-Man and Hope Pym / Wasp. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to Ant-Man (2015) and the 20th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Peyton Reed and written by the writing teams of Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and Paul Rudd, Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari. It stars Rudd as Lang and Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne, alongside Michael Peña, Walton Goggins, Hannah John-Kamen, David Dastmalchian, Tip \"T.I.\" Harris, Judy Greer, Bobby Cannavale, Randall Park, Abby Ryder Fortson, Michelle Pfeiffer, Laurence Fishburne, and Michael Douglas. In the film, the titular pair work with Hank Pym (Douglas) to retrieve Janet van Dyne (Pfeiffer) from the Quantum Realm.\n\nTalks for a sequel to Ant-Man began shortly after that film was released. Ant-Man and the Wasp was officially announced in October 2015, with Rudd and Lilly returning to reprise their roles. A month later, Ant-Man director Reed was officially set to return. He had joined the first film later in its production and was excited to develop this one from the beginning. He also looked forward to introducing Hope van Dyne as the Wasp in this film, and insisted on treating Lang and her as equals. Filming took place from August to November 2017, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, as well as Metro Atlanta; San Francisco; Savannah, Georgia; and Hawaii.\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp had its world premiere in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 25, 2018, and was released in the United States on July 6, 2018, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film was a critical and commercial success, receiving praise for its performances (particularly those of Rudd and Lilly), humor, and levity, and grossing over $622 million worldwide. A sequel, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, was released in February 2023.\n\nTwo years after Scott Lang was placed under house arrest due to his involvement with the Avengers, in violation of the Sokovia Accords,[a] Hank Pym and his daughter Hope van Dyne briefly manage to open a tunnel to the Quantum Realm. They believe Pym's wife Janet van Dyne might be trapped there after shrinking to sub-atomic levels in 1987. When he had previously visited the Quantum Realm, Lang had unknowingly become quantumly entangled with Janet, and now he receives an apparent message from her.\n\nWith only days left of house arrest, Lang contacts Pym about Janet, despite the strained relationship they have because of Lang's actions with the Avengers. Hope and Pym kidnap Lang, leaving a large ant with Lang's ankle-monitor on as a decoy so as not to arouse the suspicions of FBI agent Jimmy Woo. Believing the message from Janet is confirmation that she is alive, the trio work to build a stable quantum tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the Quantum Realm and retrieve her. They arrange to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black-market dealer Sonny Burch, but Burch realizes the potential profit to be made from Pym's research and double-crosses them. Donning the Wasp outfit, Hope fights off Burch and his men until she is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman. Lang tries to help fight off the \"ghost\", but the woman escapes with Pym's lab, which has been shrunk down to the size of a suitcase.\n\nPym reluctantly takes Hope and Lang to visit his estranged former partner Bill Foster, who gives them a way to locate the lab. After they find it, the \"ghost\" captures the trio and reveals herself to be Ava Starr. Her father, Elihas, was another of Pym's former partners. Elihas and his wife died during an experiment that caused Ava's unstable state. Foster enters and reveals that Ava is dying and in constant pain as a result of her condition. They plan to cure her using Janet's quantum energy. Believing that this will kill Janet, Pym refuses to help them and escapes with Hope, Lang, and the lab.\n\nOpening a stable version of the tunnel, Pym, Hope, and Lang are able to contact Janet, who gives them a precise location to find her but warns that they only have two hours before the unstable nature of the Quantum Realm separates them for a century. Using a truth serum, Burch learns the trio's location from Lang's business partners Luis, Dave, and Kurt, and informs a contact at the FBI. Luis warns Lang, who rushes home before Woo can see that he is violating his house arrest. Pym and Hope are arrested by the FBI, allowing Ava to take the lab.\n\nLang is soon able to help Pym and Hope escape custody, and they find the lab. Lang and Hope distract Ava while Pym enters the Quantum Realm to retrieve Janet, whom he finds alive. Meanwhile, Lang and Hope are confronted by Burch and his men, and following a lengthy chase across San Francisco, Ava regains control of the lab, allowing her to begin taking Janet's energy by force. Luis, Dave, and Kurt incapacitate Burch and his men so that Lang and Hope can stop Ava. Pym and Janet return safely from the Quantum Realm, and Janet voluntarily gives some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilize her. Lang returns home once again, in time for a now-suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest. Ava and Foster go into hiding while Burch and his men are arrested and confess due to being injected with Burch's truth serum.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Pym, Hope, and Janet send Lang into the Quantum Realm to harvest quantum energy in a plan to help Ava remain stable. Before they can retrieve Lang, the other three turn to dust.[b]\n\nAdditionally, Stan Lee, co-creator of the titular heroes, has a cameo in the film as a man whose car is shrunk by accident.[36] Michael Cerveris appears as Ava's father Elihas Starr, while Riann Steele plays his wife and Ava's mother Catherine.[13] Tim Heidecker and Brian Huskey appear in cameos as a whale boat captain named Daniel Gooobler and a teacher at Cassie's school, respectively.[15][13] Sonny Burch's team of men includes Divian Ladwa as Uzman, Goran Kostić as Anitolov, and Rob Archer as Knox, while Sean Kleier portrays Stoltz, Burch's FBI inside man and Jimmy Woo's subordinate.[13] Tom Scharpling and Jon Wurster of The Best Show were planned to make brief appearances as Burch's SUV drivers, but their scene was ultimately cut.[37]\n\nIt's such a no-brainer that there needs to be female heroes ... In the '60s comics, the Janet van Dyne Wasp was clearly written by all men and was pretty one-dimensional. She's gotten much more dimensionalized since then. That's one of those things that I think is going to be really exciting [in this film].\n\nIn June 2015, Ant-Man director Peyton Reed expressed interest in returning for a sequel or prequel to that film, saying that he had \"really fallen in love with these characters\" and felt \"there's a lot of story to tell with Hank Pym\".[39] A month later, Pym actor Michael Douglas said he was not signed for any additional films, but \"would look forward to more if it comes my way\",[40] and expressed the desire to have his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones cast as Janet van Dyne for a potential follow-up.[41] Evangeline Lilly—who played the daughter of Pym and Van Dyne, Hope van Dyne—wanted to see Michelle Pfeiffer in the role.[42] Producer Kevin Feige revealed that the studio had a \"supercool idea\" for the next Ant-Man film, and \"if audiences want it, we'll find a place to do it.\"[43] Reed also mentioned that there had been talks of making a standalone adventure with Hank Pym as Ant-Man, possibly including the original opening to Ant-Man featuring Jordi Mollà which was cut from the final film. Eric Eisenberg of CinemaBlend opined that a standalone adventure with Pym and the cut sequence would be a good candidate to revive the Marvel One-Shots short film series.[44] By the end of July, David Dastmalchian expressed interest in returning for a sequel as Kurt.[45]\n\nIn October 2015, Marvel Studios confirmed the sequel, titled Ant-Man and the Wasp, with a scheduled release date of July 6, 2018.[46] Reed was in negotiations to direct the sequel by the end of the month,[47] and announced his return in November, along with the confirmation of Paul Rudd and Lilly returning as Scott Lang / Ant-Man and Hope van Dyne / Wasp, respectively.[8] Despite being offered the chance to direct sequels in the past, Reed had never done so out of a lack of interest, but was excited to work on Ant-Man and the Wasp because there was \"a lot more story to tell with these characters that I have a genuine affection and kind of protective feeling about\".[48] He was also able to build the sequel \"from the ground up\", as he joined the first film late in the process following the departure of original writer and director Edgar Wright, and wanted to explore elements that he had set up in the first film.[49] He first began work on an outline for the sequel,[50] which he thought could be \"weird, unique and different\" now that the characters' origins had been established.[49] On being the first MCU film to have a female character in the title with the Wasp, Reed called it \"organic\" and noted the Wasp's final line in Ant-Man—'It's about damn time'—as \"very much about her specific character and arc in that movie, but it is absolutely about a larger thing. It's about damn time: We're going to have a fully realized, very very complicated hero in the next movie who happens to be a woman.\"[49] Reed would push to ensure the Wasp received equal publicity and merchandise for the film, and wanted to explore the backstory of Janet van Dyne as well. He had \"definite ideas\" of who should portray that character.[38] Reed said the alternate title Wasp and the Ant-Man was briefly considered, but was not chosen due to fan expectation given the comics history of the phrase \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\".[51] That month, Adam McKay, one of the writers of Ant-Man, expressed interest in returning to write the film,[52] and Douglas confirmed that he was in talks to return as well.[8]\n\nReed stated in early December that the film may \"call back\" to the heist film genre and tone of Ant-Man, but that Ant-Man and the Wasp would \"have an entirely different genre template\". He hoped to incorporate additional flashback sequences in the film, as well as explore Pym's various identities from the comics and his psychology. Reed also said he was \"excited\" about exploring and discovering the film version of the Ant-Man and Wasp relationship that is \"a romantic partnership and a heroic partnership\" in the comics, a \"different dynamic than we've seen in the rest of the [MCU], an actual partnership.\" Additionally, Reed mentioned that pre-production would \"probably\" start in October 2016, with filming scheduled for early 2017.[53] Production writers for the first film, Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer, signed on to write the script along with Rudd,[54] with writing starting \"in earnest\" in January 2016.[53] The next month, McKay stated that he would be involved with the film in some capacity.[55] By April, the four writers and Reed had been \"holed up in a room ... brainstorming the story\", with Reed promising that it would have \"stuff in it that you've never ever seen in a movie before\".[56] Feige added that they wanted to \"stay true to what made [Ant-Man] so unique and different\", and teased the potential of seeing the Giant-Man version of Lang that had been introduced in Captain America: Civil War (2016).[57] Despite being \"intimately involved in the writing and the development of the script\", Reed did not take or receive a writing credit on the film.[48]\n\nIn June 2016, Reed said that for inspiration from the comics he had been looking at \"early Avengers stuff and all the way up to the Nick Spencer stuff now\", and was focusing on iconic images that could be replicated in the film over story beats from the comics. He added that there was \"definitely a chance\" for Michael Peña, Tip \"T.I.\" Harris, and Dastmalchian to reprise their respective roles as Luis, Dave, and Kurt from the first film.[9] At San Diego Comic-Con 2016, Feige stated that Reed and Rudd were still working on the script,[58] and that filming was now expected to begin in June 2017.[58][59] Rudd elaborated that they had \"turned in a treatment, but it's so preliminary. We'll see. We have an idea of what it might look like, but it could change a lot from where we're at now.\"[60] The next month, Peña was confirmed to be returning as Luis,[16] while filming was revealed to be taking place in Atlanta, Georgia.[61] In early October, an initial script had been completed for the film that was awaiting approval from Marvel.[62] Reed later revealed that early drafts of the script included a cameo appearance from Captain America, appearing during Luis' flashback sequences as he was recapping Lang's involvement in the airport battle in Civil War. However, the writers chose to remove the appearance in the final script since the events of Civil War were already referenced frequently in the film, and this instance \"didn't feel organic to the story.\"[63]\n\nAt the start of November 2016, Reed said that the film's production would transition from \"the writing phase\" to \"official prep\" that month, beginning with visual development. Reed reiterated his excitement for introducing the Wasp and \"really designing her look, the way she moves, the power set, and figuring out, sort of, who Hope van Dyne is as a hero\".[64] Reed was inspired by the films After Hours (1985), Midnight Run (1988), and What's Up, Doc? (1972) for the look and feel of Ant-Man and the Wasp.[65] While the first film was more of a heist film, Reed described this as part action film, part romantic comedy, and was inspired by the works of Elmore Leonard where there are \"villains, but we also have antagonists, and we have these roadblocks to our heroes getting to where they need to be\".[34] He also stated his disappointment in the Giant-Man introduction happening in Civil War, rather than an Ant-Man film,[64] but noted that the appearance provided character development opportunities between Lang, Pym, and Van Dyne since Pym is \"very clear in the first movie about how he feels about Stark and how he feels about the Avengers and being very protective of this technology that he has\",[34] and so Reed thought Pym would be \"pissed\" and Van Dyne would feel betrayed, which was Reed's \"in\" for those characters' starting dynamics.[18] Reed added that he spends \"a lot of time\" talking with the other writers and directors of MCU films, and that he and the writers on this film wished to maintain \"our little Ant-Man corner of the universe. Because it's a whole different vibe tonally\".[64] Quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis from the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the California Institute of Technology returned to consult on the film, after doing the same on Ant-Man, and explained the science behind getting extremely small to the filmmakers. Michalakis described the subatomic realm as \"a place of infinite possibility, an alternative universe where the laws of physics and forces of nature as we know them haven't crystallized\" and suggested it should be represented in the film by \"beautiful colors changing constantly to reflect transience.\"[66]\n\nIn February 2017, Douglas confirmed that he would reprise his role as Hank Pym in the film.[35] During the Hollywood premiere of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in April, Dastmalchian confirmed his return as Kurt,[22] and a month later, Harris confirmed his return as Dave as well.[24] Through that May, Marvel was meeting with several actresses for a \"key role\" in the sequel, with Hannah John-Kamen cast in the part at the beginning of June.[67] The following month, Randall Park joined the cast as Jimmy Woo,[28] and Walton Goggins was cast in an undisclosed role.[68] At San Diego Comic-Con 2017, Park's casting was confirmed; John-Kamen and Goggins' roles were revealed to be Ghost and Sonny Burch, respectively; and the casting of Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne and Laurence Fishburne as Bill Foster was announced.[27] Judy Greer was confirmed to be reprising her role as Maggie from the previous film the following week.[25] Louise Frogley served as costume designer on the film after doing so for Marvel's Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), and worked with Ivo Coveney to create the superhero suits for the film. Based on designs by Andy Park, the suits are updated for the film from the 1960s-inspired designs used in the first Ant-Man to more modern designs. The Wasp suit included practical wings which were replaced with digital wings for when they are expanded and ready for flight.[13]\n\nThe Russo brothers, directors of Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), which were filming while Ant-Man and the Wasp was preparing to film, were in constant discussion with Reed in order to ensure story elements would line up between the films. Joe Russo added that Ant-Man and the Wasp would have \"some [plot] elements that stitch in\" closely with Avengers: Infinity War, more so than some of the other films leading up to the Avengers films.[69] Reed knew Ant-Man and the Wasp would be \"a fairly stand-alone movie but... could not ignore the events of Infinity War\", with the biggest connection occurring in the film's mid-credit scene. Since the events of Ant-Man and the Wasp occur over 48 hours, the timeline in relation to Infinity War was \"left purposefully ambiguous\" with Reed noting there had been discussions of placing \"little Easter eggs along the way, to start to reveal to the audience where the movie takes place in the timeline, [but t]hat felt not very fun to us and kind of obvious.\" Reed also liked how the film ends with closure and on a positive note \"and then to BANG — give the audience a gut punch right after the main credits\",[70] with the sequence showing Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, and Hope van Dyne disintegrating due to the Blip featured at the end of Avengers: Infinity War. The film also has a post-credit scene that shows the ant who doubled for Lang while under house arrest performing a drum solo.[6]\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 1, 2017,[26] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[61][71] under the working title Cherry Blue;[72] Dante Spinotti served as director of photography,[26] shooting on Arri Alexa 65 cameras, with some sequences being shot with a Frazier lens.[31] At the start of filming, Marvel revealed that Bobby Cannavale and Abby Ryder Fortson would also reprise their roles from the first film, respectively as Paxton and Cassie, and that Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers had contributed to the screenplay.[26]\n\nThe film's lab and quantum tunnel set was inspired by The Time Tunnel (1966–1967), and was the largest physical set built for an MCU film, which Reed jokingly said was \"a little counter-intuitive\".[18] For the sequence where Janet van Dyne communicates through Lang, inspiration was taken from All of Me (1984) in which Lily Tomlin's character is trapped in the body of Steve Martin's character. There were discussions about having Pfeiffer perform the scene first to give Rudd an idea of how she would act, but the group ultimately decided to let Rudd invent the scene completely himself.[18][48] For the chamber in Ghost's lair, the production team under production designer Shepherd Frankel wanted to create an environment that was unique to the MCU, and designed the chamber with Fresnel lenses to give it concentric-circle patterns that served a practical purpose for the film's story as well as differentiating the aesthetics of it from other sets and creating mystery about the character. The chamber is surrounded by \"support shapes\" to \"create this feeling of desperation and yearning for family and stability\".[13] Douglas and Pfeiffer filmed flashback scenes of Pym and Van Dyne set in the 1980s for Ant-Man and the Wasp, but Reed decided to cut them because he felt it was unnecessary to include them in the final film, believing the plot should focus on the present rather than the past.[73]\n\nFilming also took place in Metro Atlanta, with filming locations including the Atlanta International School, the Midtown and Buckhead districts of Atlanta, and the Samuel M. Inman Middle School in the city's Virginia-Highland neighborhood; as well as Emory University and the Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton, Georgia.[74] Additional filming took place in San Francisco in September 2017,[75] in Savannah, Georgia in late October,[76] and in Hawaii.[77] Production wrapped on November 19, 2017.[78]\n\nIn late November, Lilly said that the characters would try to enter the Quantum Realm in the film, and their potential success would \"open a whole entire new multi-verse to enter into and play around in\" for the MCU.[79] Patrick Burleigh, who was part of Marvel's writers program, did uncredited work on the script ahead of the film's reshoots.[80] The film includes a clip from Animal House (1978), which Reed was reminded of while discussing the quantum realm science for the film. Reed insisted that the film be shorter than two hours since it would be following the \"massive epic\" Infinity War and because it is \"an action/comedy, and it didn't want to overstay its welcome\".[18] Dan Lebental and Craig Wood edited the film.[13] The film's main credits sequence is a \"table-top\" version of its action sequences,[18] and was created by Elastic.[81] An alternative idea that had been considered was to create a \"fake behind-the-scenes documentary\" that would have made the film look like it was a 1950s-era Godzilla movie with \"people in suits stomping on model cityscapes\".[18]\n\nVisual effects for the film were created by DNEG, Scanline VFX, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, Lola VFX, Industrial Light & Magic,[31] Cinesite, Rise FX, Rodeo FX, Crafty Apes, Perception NYC, Digital Domain, and The Third Floor.[82] DNEG worked on over 500 shots, including the effects for Ghost—which were shared with the other vendors—the third act chase sequence, and the final Ghost fight as Hank and Janet are returning from the quantum realm. For the \"macro-photography\" sequences in the film, DNEG took a different approach from their work in Ant-Man due to issues including trying to get a camera to seem small enough to capture the small actions. Though some of the film was shot with a Frazier lens that provides extra depth of field, DNEG would still need to \"re-project the road higher and \"raise the floor level\" to simulate a tiny sized camera\". As the third act chase sequence was mainly shot in Atlanta, while being set in San Francisco, DNEG VFX Supervisor Alessandro Ongaro noted it required \"extensive environment work\" with background elements in some shots not being salvageable at all.[31] DNEG ultimately created 130 unique environments for the chase. Clear Angle aided DNEG with the Lidar surveying and photography of San Francisco, and were able to get their information for Lombard Street down to the millimeter resolution.[83] DNEG also handled the stereo conversion on the film to release it in both 2.39:1 and 1.90:1 (for IMAX) aspect ratios. The squarer frame of the IMAX ratio was used as the basis for the visual effects, with the 2.39:1 version then being letterboxed from the finished IMAX version.[31]\n\nLola once again worked on the de-aging sequences with Douglas, Pfeiffer, and Fishburne. The flashback sequences featuring a younger Hank Pym were set around the same time as the flashback sequences of Ant-Man, so Lola were able to use a similar process, referencing Douglas' appearance in Wall Street (1987) and having the actor on set in a different wardrobe and wig. Lola VFX Supervisor Trent Claus felt Pfeiffer's was less complicated, since \"she has aged incredibly well\" and still has big hair and a big smile. Pfeiffer's work from Ladyhawke (1985) and other films around that time was referenced. For Fishburne, his son served as his younger double, and helped inform Lola how the older Fishburne's skin would have looked in certain lighting situations. The films Lola looked to for Fishburne's younger self included Boyz n the Hood (1991) and Deep Cover (1992). Lola also made Fishburne thinner, and all actors had their posture adjusted.[31]\n\nLuma worked on the scenes where Ant-Man and the Wasp infiltrate Ghost's hideout, where they had to recreate the entire environment with CGI. They also created the first quantum tunnel sequence where Ghost receives her powers, and the flashback missile launch, which had to be replicated exactly from how it appeared in Ant-Man. The new version of the quantum realm, designed by Reed and production VFX supervisor Stephane Ceretti, was created by Method. Method Studios VFX Supervisor Andrew Hellen, explained, \"We did a lot of research into macro and cellular level photography, and played with different ways to visualize quantum mechanics. It has a very magical quality, with a scientific edge. We also used glitching effects and macro lensing to ground the footage, and keep it from feeling too terrestrial.\" Method also worked on the sequence when Lang is the size of a preschooler, and created the digital doubles for Ant-Man and Wasp; Method used the same level of detail on the digital double suits regardless of what scale they were.[31]\n\nIn June 2017, Reed confirmed that Christophe Beck, who composed the score for Ant-Man, would return for Ant-Man and the Wasp.[84] Beck reprised his main theme from Ant-Man, and also wrote a new one for Wasp that he wanted to be \"high energy\" and show that she is more certain of her abilities than Lang. When choosing between these themes for specific scenes throughout the film, Beck tried to choose the Wasp theme more often so there would be \"enough newness in the score to feel like it's going new places, and isn't just some retread.\"[85] Hollywood Records and Marvel Music released the soundtrack album digitally on July 6, 2018.[86]\n\nConcept art and \"pre-CGI video\" for the film was shown at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con.[87] In January 2018, Hyundai Motor America announced that the 2019 Hyundai Veloster would play a significant role in the film, with other Hyundai vehicles also appearing.[88] The first trailer for the film was released on January 30, 2018, on Good Morning America,[89] and used the guitar riff from Adam and the Ants' \"Ants Invasion\".[90] David Betancourt of The Washington Post called the release, the day after the widely praised Black Panther premiere, a \"smart move\"; with Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War also releasing in 2018, \"it can be easy [to] forget that hey, there is an Ant-Man sequel coming this year... So Marvel Studios giving us a quick reminder with this trailer release is logical\".[91] Tracy Brown, writing for the Los Angeles Times, praised how the trailer prominently featured Lilly's Van Dyne showing \"she was always meant to be a superhero\".[92]\n\nA second trailer was released on May 1, 2018, following a teaser video featuring the Infinity War cast asking \"where were Ant-Man and The Wasp?\" in that film.[93][2] Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt the trailer made the film feel \"very much like an intentional antidote for, or at least alternative to, the grimness of Infinity War's downbeat ending\", calling it \"a smart move\" since it could be considered \"a palate cleanser and proof that Marvel has more to offer... before audiences dive back into the core narrative with next year's Captain Marvel.\"[93] In June 2018, Feige presented several scenes from the film at CineEurope.[94] Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle!, an attraction inspired by the film, opened at Hong Kong Disneyland on March 31, 2019. It features Rudd and Lilly reprising their roles in clips that were made during the film's reshoots.[95] Promotional partners for the film included Dell, Synchrony Financial, and Sprint. Disney spent around $154 million worldwide promoting the film.[2]\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp had its world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 25, 2018,[96] and was released in the United States on July 6, 2018,[46] where it opened in 4,206 theaters, of which 3,000 were in 3D, 403 were in IMAX, over 660 were in premium large format, and over 220 were in D-Box and 4DX.[2] The film is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[97]\n\nThe film was scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom on June 29, 2018, but was rescheduled in November 2017 to August 3, 2018,[98] in order to avoid competition with the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Charles Gant of The Guardian and Screen International noted, \"The worry for film distributors is that audiences will be caught up in the tournament. So it's easier to play safe and not date your film at this time, especially during the group stage, when all the qualifying nations are competing.\" Tom Butler of Yahoo! Movies UK added that, unlike the first film, which was one of the lowest-grossing MCU films in the UK, anticipation levels for the film \"are at an all-time high following the events of Infinity War\" and \"UK audiences will probably have found out what happens in the film well before it opens in UK cinemas, and this could have a negative impact on its box office potential.\"[99] Butler and Huw Fullerton of Radio Times both opined the delay could also be in part because of Disney also delaying the United Kingdom release of Incredibles 2 to July 13, 2018 (a month after its United States release), and not wanting to compete with itself with the two films.[99][100] This in turn led fans in the country to start a Change.org petition to have Disney move the release date up several weeks, similarly to how Avengers: Infinity War's United States release was moved up a week the previous May.[101]\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on October 2, 2018, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on October 16. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, an introduction from Reed, deleted scenes, and gag reels. The digital release also features a look at the role concept art plays in bringing the various MCU films to life and a faux commercial for Online Close-Up Magic University.[102] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[103]\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp grossed $216.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $406 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $622.7 million.[5] Following its opening, Deadline Hollywood estimated the film would turn a net profit of around $100 million.[2] It became the eleventh-highest-grossing film of 2018.[104]\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp earned $33.8 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada (including $11.5 million from Thursday night previews),[2] and a total opening weekend of $75.8 million;[3] this was a 33% improvement over the first film's debut of $57.2 million. Its opening included $6 million from IMAX screens.[2] In its second weekend, the film earned $28.8 million, coming in second behind Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation, and in its third weekend grossed $16.1 million, coming in fourth.[105][106] The film placed sixth in its fourth weekend,[107] seventh in its fifth weekend,[108] and tenth in its sixth weekend.[109]\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film earned $85 million from 41 markets, where it opened number one in all except New Zealand. Its South Korea opening was $20.9 million (which included previews). The $15.5 million opening from the market without previews was the second-best opening of 2018 behind Avengers: Infinity War.[110] In its second weekend, playing in 44 markets, it remained number one in Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Singapore.[111] The film opened in France in its third weekend, earning $4.1 million,[112] and opened in Germany in its fourth, where it was number one and earned $2.8 million, including previews.[113] The next weekend saw Ant-Man and the Wasp open at number one (when including previews) in the United Kingdom, where it earned $6.5 million,[114] and two weeks later, Italy opened number one with $2.7 million (including previews).[115] In its eighth weekend, the film's $68 million opening in China was the fourth-best MCU opening in China and the third-highest Hollywood film opening of 2018. $7.2 million was from IMAX, which was the best August IMAX opening in China.[116] The film opened in Japan the next weekend, earning $3.7 million, which was the top Western film for the weekend.[117] As of September 9, 2018[update], the film's largest markets were China ($117.5 million),[118] South Korea ($42.4 million), and the United Kingdom ($21.5 million).[117]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 87%, with an average score of 7/10, based on 446 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A lighter, brighter superhero movie powered by the effortless charisma of Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, Ant-Man and The Wasp offers a much-needed MCU palate cleanser.\"[120] On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 56 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[121] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, down from the \"A\" earned by the first film.[2]\n\nPeter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and praised Rudd and Lilly, saying, \"The secret of Ant-Man and the Wasp is that it works best when it doesn't try so hard, when it lets charm trump excess and proves that less can be more even in the Marvel universe.\"[119] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the lightweight tone as a treat and a breath following the \"dramatically heavy conclusion\" of Avengers: Infinity War. He also praised the cast, especially Rudd and Fortson, as well as the visual effects and inventive use of shrinking and growing in the action scenes.[122] Manohla Dargis at The New York Times felt the film's \"fast, bright and breezy\" tone was a vast improvement over the first film, praising Reed's direction. She also praised Rudd, felt Lilly found \"her groove\" in the film, and wrote that the supporting cast all had \"scene-steal[ing]\" sequences.[123] Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com said the film was \"good enough\", a \"messy, but satisfying\" sequel that he felt managed to juggle its many subplots while giving Rudd's Lang some decent character development.[124]\n\nVariety's Owen Gleiberman called the film \"faster, funnier, and more cunningly confident than the original,\" and felt Reed was able to give the film enough personality to overcome its two-hour runtime and effects-heavy climax. He did caution that this was \"not quite the same thing as humanity. But it's enough to qualify as the miniature version.\"[125] At The Washington Post, Ann Hornaday called the film \"instantly forgettable\" and criticized its plot, which she felt included some \"filler\" subplots, but found the film to be \"no less enjoyable\" because of this. She particularly praised Rudd along with the action and effects.[126] Writing for The Boston Globe, Ty Burr called the film the perfect \"summer air-conditioning movie\", finding it fun, funny, superficial and an improvement over the first. He also wrote that the film had too many subplots and not enough of Pfeiffer, but was pleased with the lack of connection that the overall story had to the rest of the MCU, and with the focus on \"pop trash\" comedy.[127] Stephanie Zacharek, writing for Time, said it was \"hard to actively dislike\" the film, which she thought had reasonably fun action and stand-out moments between Rudd and Fortson; but she was not as impressed with the larger, effects-heavy action sequences and felt the focus on Lilly as a better hero than Rudd was \"just checking off boxes in the name of gender equality.\"[128]\n\nA sequel, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, was released on February 17, 2023,[137] with Reed returning to direct and Jeff Loveness writing the script.[138][139] Rudd, Lilly, Douglas, and Pfeiffer reprise their roles, while Kathryn Newton takes over as Cassie Lang. Jonathan Majors joins as Kang the Conqueror.[138]\n"

        "content": "\n\nCaptain Marvel is a 2019 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 21st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck from a screenplay they co-wrote with Geneva Robertson-Dworet. It stars Brie Larson as Carol Danvers, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Lashana Lynch, Gemma Chan, Annette Bening, Clark Gregg, and Jude Law. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes Captain Marvel after Earth is caught in a galactic conflict.\n\nDevelopment began by May 2013. The film was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led project. Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve were hired to write it the following April after submitting separate takes on the character, and borrowed elements from Roy Thomas's 1971 \"Kree–Skrull War\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con, with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet was soon hired to re-write the script, and the rest of the cast were added by the start of filming. Location shooting began in January 2018, with principal photography starting that March in California and concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Several actors reprise their roles from previous MCU films, including Jackson and Gregg. They were both digitally de-aged in post-production to reflect the film's 1990s setting.\n\nCaptain Marvel premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8 as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019 and was the 23rd-highest-grossing film of all time during its theatrical run. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances—particularly Larson's. Audience responses were also positive, although the audience reception section on Rotten Tomatoes was subject to review bombing. A sequel, The Marvels, was released on November 10, 2023.\n\nIn 1995, on the Kree Empire's capital planet of Hala, Starforce member Vers suffers from amnesia and recurring nightmares involving an older woman. Yon-Rogg, her mentor and commander, trains Vers to control her abilities, while the Supreme Intelligence, the artificial intelligence that rules the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check. \n\nDuring a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a group of Skrulls, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree are at war, Vers is captured by Skrull commander Talos. A probe of Vers' memories leads them to Earth. Vers escapes and crash-lands in Los Angeles. Her presence attracts S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury and Phil Coulson, whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. Vers recovers a crystal containing her extracted memories in the ensuing chase while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson.\n\nTalos, disguised as Fury's boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers and keep tabs on her. Using her extracted memories, Vers and Fury go to the Project Pegasus installation at a U.S. Air Force base. They discover that Vers was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by Dr. Wendy Lawson, whom Vers recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. Fury informs S.H.I.E.L.D. of their location and a team arrives. Fury realizes that Keller is Talos and helps Vers escape in a jet with Lawson's stowaway cat, Goose.\n\nThey fly to Louisiana to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau, the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive. Rambeau and her daughter Monica reveal that Vers is Carol Danvers, who was once like family to them. Talos, arriving unarmed, explains that the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and that Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping them. Talos plays a recovered blackbox recording from Lawson's jet, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell to prevent her from destroying the engine before the Kree could recover it. Destroying the engine herself, Danvers absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, gaining powers but losing her memory.\n\nDanvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos' family, and the Tesseract, the power source of Lawson's engine. There, Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the Supreme Intelligence. Danvers removes the Kree implant that suppressed her powers during their encounter, allowing her to reach her full potential. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien Flerken. Goose swallows the Tesseract and scratches Fury, blinding his left eye. Danvers destroys a Kree bomber, forcing Kree officer Ronan the Accuser and his squadron to retreat.\n\nDanvers overpowers Yon-Rogg and sends him to Hala with a warning for the Supreme Intelligence. She then departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, leaving Fury a modified pager to contact her in an emergency. Fury drafts an initiative to locate heroes like Danvers, naming it after her Air Force call sign, \"Avenger\". In a mid-credits scene, set in 2018, the activated pager[a] is being monitored by the Avengers when Danvers appears looking for Fury.[b] In a post-credits scene, Goose climbs onto Fury's desk and regurgitates the Tesseract.\n\nAdditional members of Starforce include Algenis Pérez Soto as Att-Lass, the marksman of the team, and Rune Temte as Bron-Char, the \"bigger, stronger guy who fights with his fists\".[14][29] Maria's daughter, Monica Rambeau, is played by Akira and Azari Akbar as an eleven-year-old and a five-year-old, respectively.[18][44] Sharon Blynn portrays Soren, Talos' wife,[45] while Auden L. Ophuls and Harriet L. Ophuls portray their daughter.[46] Robert Kazinsky appears as a biker nicknamed \"The Don\".[18] Vik Sahay plays a Torfan,[18] while Chuku Modu portrays the Kree spy Soh-Larr.[18] Colin Ford appears as Danvers' brother, Steve,[18] and Kenneth Mitchell plays their father.[18] Danvers' comic book cat Chewie (named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca) appears in the film, renamed Goose after the Top Gun (1986) character Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw.[24][47] Its name was changed since Star Wars is a contemporary franchise and not specific to Danvers, unlike the pilot-themed Top Gun.[48] Goose is portrayed by four different cats, each chosen for their actions and personality: Reggie, Archie, Rizzo, and Gonzo.[24] Patrick Brennan, who previously portrayed Marcus Daniels in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., appears as a bartender. Producer Victoria Alonso alluded to the possibility that the two were the same character.[49]\n\nReal-life Air Force pilots Matthew \"Spider\" Kimmel and Stephen \"Cajun\" Del Bagno appear as themselves.[18] Del Bagno died months prior to the film's release,[50] and it is dedicated to his memory.[51] Captain Marvel comic book writer Kelly Sue DeConnick makes a cameo appearance as a train station passerby,[24] and Stan Lee, co-creator of Captain Marvel, appears posthumously as himself memorizing the lines for his cameo in Mallrats (1995).[52] Reprising their MCU roles for the mid-credits scene are Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, and Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes.[6]\n\nWe've been talking a lot about ... how to write a strong female superhero without making it Superman with boobs. ... [W]e have this constant back-and-forth about how to tell a story that is compelling, entertaining, moving, kick-ass, and fun, and also be aware of what those larger implications might be.\n\nBy May 2013, Marvel Studios' writing room had produced a script for a film featuring Ms. Marvel, an alias used by the character Carol Danvers before she took the mantle Captain Marvel.[54] Later that year, executive producer Louis D'Esposito said the studio was interested in a female-driven superhero film and had plenty of \"strong female characters\" from which to choose, suggesting Captain Marvel, Black Widow, Pepper Potts, or Peggy Carter as possible candidates.[55] Kevin Feige, President of Marvel Studios, said that if Marvel was to make a female-led film, he would prefer it to be a new character to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) like Captain Marvel, for whom an origin story could be told.[56] In August 2014, Feige stated that development had begun on a Captain Marvel film, and said members of the public asked about the project more often than Iron Man 4 or Avengers: Infinity War (2018).[57]\n\nIn October 2014, Feige announced that Captain Marvel would be the studio's first female-led film, and would focus on Carol Danvers.[58][59] It was given a release date of July 6, 2018, as part of their Phase Three slate of films.[58] Feige said the film had been in development almost as long as Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Doctor Strange (2016), and one of its biggest challenges would be balancing the title character's \"earthbound\" adventures with her cosmic powers.[58] He said a writer and director for the film would be announced soon, and female filmmakers were being considered for the project, but he could not promise that filmmakers from a certain demographic would be hired for the film.[60]\n\nIn February 2015, Marvel pushed the release date back to November 2, 2018, to accommodate Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).[61] In early April, Feige revealed that Captain Marvel had been included in an early draft of the Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) screenplay, but Marvel chose to remove this appearance because they did not want to introduce the character before they were able to explore her backstory and personality first.[62] He also said that Marvel would announce writers for the film within a few weeks,[63] and by mid-April, Guardians of the Galaxy co-screenwriter Nicole Perlman and Inside Out (2015) co-screenwriter Meg LeFauve were announced to be writing the screenplay.[64] The duo were put together as a writing team after impressing Feige with separate takes on the character,[65] and began work on the film within a month.[66] Jessica Gao, who would later become the head writer for the Marvel Studios television series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022), also pitched for the film,[67] as did A. C. Bradley who became the head writer of the Marvel Studios animated series What If...? (2021-2024).[68] LeFauve found the character being a female superhero to be both \"wonderful\" and a challenge, believing that the character's power-level could lead to the \"Superman curse\" of being perceived to be invulnerable.[69] Additionally, LeFauve and Perlman found that writing a \"story about a human and not get[ting] too overwhelmed by the worry of representing all women\" worked best when approaching the story. An article about young girls who would quit learning to code after they encountered trouble made LeFauve and Perlman consider questions about females being taught they cannot make mistakes or embrace their own power. This helped the duo realize that \"part of embracing your power is failure\" and seeing it \"more as feedback instead of your character\".[70]\n\nBy May, Marvel had discussions with Ava DuVernay about directing Captain Marvel or Black Panther (2018),[71] which Feige confirmed a month later, saying that he had met with DuVernay amongst a number of other directors and expected a decision to be made by mid- to late 2015.[72] That September, Feige said that the casting process would not begin until 2016, as the studio did not want to try to cast Carol Danvers until they had decided on the direction for the character in the screenplay, as well as the structure of the film and the character's role in the rest of Marvel's Phase Three films. Producer Jeremy Latcham elaborated that \"getting the character right first is going to lead the charge\".[73] In October 2015, Marvel changed the release date again, this time moving it to March 8, 2019, to make room for Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018).[74]\n\nFeige stated in April 2016 that a director would be announced within a few months and that the first cast members would be announced in mid-2016. He also mentioned that the film would be about Carol Danvers becoming Captain Marvel.[75] The next month, indie filmmaker Emily Carmichael's name surfaced as a possible contender to direct the film,[76] and by June, Brie Larson emerged as the frontrunner to play Captain Marvel.[77] Larson's casting was confirmed at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con.[78] She was set to earn $5 million for the film.[79] Larson was initially hesitant to accept the role, but \"couldn't deny the fact that this movie is everything I care about, everything that's progressive and important and meaningful, and a symbol I wished I would've had growing up\".[80] She was able to bring to the part \"some of those [deep emotional] things\" she had used in previous, more \"dramatic roles\". Larson felt this would differentiate Captain Marvel from other superhero films.[7] Also at Comic-Con, Feige said the search for a director had narrowed to ten candidates and he hoped to announce the final choice in the coming months.[81]\n\nPerlman revealed in August that the character's origin story had been changed for the film because of similarities to the DC Comics character Green Lantern,[82] with Feige explaining that the new story is centered on Danvers finding her limitations and vulnerabilities. He added that Danvers is the most powerful character in the MCU, and would become very important in the franchise.[83] Producer Nate Moore said the film avoids the traditional structure of many MCU origin stories, which he described as a character having a problem before gaining \"powers at the end of the first act, and the end of the second act they learn about the powers, the third act they probably fight a villain who has a function of the same powers\";[84] instead, Danvers starts the film having already gained her powers.[10]\n\nIn October 2016, Feige admitted that the announcement for a director was taking longer than he previously expected, and explained that the studio was now waiting for more of the film's story to be defined in the script so they could then talk to potential directors about it. Once again talking about hiring a female filmmaker to direct the film, Feige said that he did not think it would be a requirement to make a \"great version\" of the film, but it was something that Marvel felt was important to consider, even if that female filmmaker did not know a lot about the comics, as \"they just have to fall in love with it once they are presented with it. It's amazing to see all of the filmmakers read through [the source material] and know, 'Oh, a female's writing it now'\", speaking in particular to Kelly Sue DeConnick's run in the comics.[83] Feige expected a director to be announced by the end of 2016;[85] however, Perlman and LeFauve turned in a script treatment around December, pushing additional meetings with director candidates into early 2017.[86]\n\nIn February 2017, Perlman stated that despite her and LeFauve being hired almost a year previously, the duo had only recently gotten their \"marching orders\" for the script, stating that one of the reasons for the delay was figuring out where the film would fit within the MCU.[12] She explained that because of Marvel Studios' continually shifting plans for Phase Three and their culminating Avengers films, Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame (2019), the duo were tasked with creating various different versions of what the film could look like. These were then discussed with Marvel Studios executives to determine what worked from each and how it would fit in with the Avengers plans as they currently stood, before the writing duo would start the process over again; this \"iterative\" process occurred for over a year-and-a-half.[87]: 323–324  Perlman also discussed the character's femininity, feeling that it was important to make sure she is not \"somebody who is a hero in spite of her femininity ... being a woman is part of [her] strength\". The writers were also wary of tropes that could be diminishing to a female character but not for male characters, such as things they would not have been concerned about writing for Iron Man but would not play the same way for Captain Marvel.[12]\n\nThis is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly. ... [W]hat makes her special is just how human she is. She's funny, but doesn't always tell good jokes. And she can be headstrong and reckless and doesn't always make the perfect decisions for herself. But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity—and all of its messiness.\n\nMarvel hired Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck to direct Captain Marvel in April 2017, after the duo impressed the studio over numerous meetings with their vision for the character and because of their experience working in both television and film.[88] Feige said that he and Marvel were particularly impressed with Boden and Fleck's ability to create a diverse range of character-driven stories in all of their works. Feige felt the film had to focus on the complexity and relatability of Carol Danvers' character without being bogged down by the villains and the special effects, and thought that Boden and Fleck could provide this character focus.[89] Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2018, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[90] but Feige said he did not expect it to begin until February.[91]\n\nBy July 2017, Samuel L. Jackson was set to appear in the film, reprising his role as Nick Fury.[92] Larson, who had worked with Jackson on Kong: Skull Island (2017), pushed for Fury's presence in the film.[93] At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige revealed that the film would take place in the 1990s and that the Skrulls would be the film's villains, allowing elements from the \"Kree–Skrull War\" (1971) comic book storyline to be used.[20][94] By setting the film in the 1990s, Feige noted that Danvers would \"be the singular hero\" while still giving her a definitive placing in the MCU timeline.[21] Executive producer Jonathan Schwartz said setting the film in the 1990s was an idea from early in the development process, and gave the character a special place and significance within the MCU. It also allowed the film to make connections to plot details from past MCU films that are set later in the timeline.[24] Regarding the elements from the \"Kree–Skrull War\" used for the film, Schwartz said some paranoia elements would be featured but would not be related to the Anti-Superhero Act as in the comics. He added that the Kree-Skrull conflict would mostly be a \"backdrop and mythological underpinning\" for the film.[41] In response to the Comic-Con announcements, Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter compared the film to Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and the DC Extended Universe film Wonder Woman (2017), as they were also set decades before the present day. By setting the film in the 1990s, McMillan felt it would create the question \"what happened to Captain Marvel to take her off the playing field ahead of the Marvel movies that we've seen to date?\"[95]\n\nAlso in July, the California Film Commission awarded a $20.7 million tax credit to the production,[96] going towards the first $100 million spent on qualified in-state expenditures,[97] making California the main filming location for Captain Marvel. D'Esposito was excited about this since Marvel Studios' headquarters and post-production facilities are also in the state, allowing them to streamline the production process for this film and others.[96] Awarding of the tax credit was dependent on filming beginning within 180 days.[98] Marvel planned to spend $118.6 million filming in the state, for a net of $97.8 million after the tax credit was applied.[99] Schwartz said one of the reasons Los Angeles was chosen for filming was because \"not a lot of big movies shoot in LA anymore, so it weirdly feels like fresh territory for a movie like this\".[100]\n\nGeneva Robertson-Dworet was hired by mid-August to take over the scripting duties for Captain Marvel after LeFauve left the project to co-direct Gigantic for Disney Animation.[101] Perlman also left the project, but stated that the story she and LeFauve had worked on in earlier drafts would be retained in the final screenplay.[102] Robertson-Dworet described the film as an action-comedy, and likened her script to an initial one she wrote for Tomb Raider (2018) before that film took a more dramatic tone. She added that it was important to the entire creative team to keep the comedic elements of the film and the sassiness of Danvers' character. Robertson-Dworet also credited Boden for helping to shape Danvers' voice in the film and for the desire \"to carve our own path and make sure we weren't retreading the same territory [after the release of Wonder Woman], and showing all facets of what women are capable of\".[103] Feige added that Captain Marvel would have action scenes that would pay homage to 1990s action films, including Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), since the 1990s action genre was one Marvel Studios had yet to explore. He also stated that much of the film would take place in outer space.[21] RoboCop (1987), The French Connection (1971), and The Conversation (1974) also served as influences on Captain Marvel for Boden and Fleck. Speaking specifically to RoboCop, the directors were drawn to \"this idea of a character who's finding himself and finding his past\" from that film and how it could connect to the story they were telling in Captain Marvel.[104] DeConnick and quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis, of the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the California Institute of Technology, consulted on the film.[33][105]\n\nBy October, filming was slated to begin in March 2018. Feige said the film would play a significant role in setting up Endgame, which was set for release after Captain Marvel.[106] Ben Mendelsohn entered negotiations to play the film's main villain,[107] having previously worked with Boden and Fleck on their film Mississippi Grind (2015). They had him in mind for the Captain Marvel villain when they first began working on the story, and Mendelsohn agreed to play the role shortly after discussing the film with the directors.[108] By November, Jude Law was in negotiations to join the film, which at the time was reported to be the role of Walter Lawson / Mar-Vell.[109] Keanu Reeves had also been approached for the part but declined.[110] In January 2018, DeWanda Wise was cast as Maria Rambeau,[32][111] and Mendelsohn and Law were confirmed to have been cast.[111]\n\nLocation shooting occurred at the end of January 2018.[112][113] Set photos taken at that time showed Larson in a green-and-black uniform instead of the character's familiar red-and-blue suit. Feige responded by saying that Marvel accepts the risk of set photos being leaked as a consequence of location shooting, and felt that \"most people are savvy enough to know they're looking at a behind-the-scenes photo, completely out of context\". He added that a large number of scenes in the film would be shot on location.[113]\n\nA month later, Gemma Chan joined the cast as Minn-Erva.[114] In mid-March, Wise withdrew from the film because of a scheduling conflict with her television series She's Gotta Have It.[115] Lashana Lynch entered into negotiations to replace Wise the next day,[116] and was confirmed for the role by the end of the month. At that time, Marvel revealed that Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, and Clark Gregg were set to reprise their respective roles of Korath, Ronan the Accuser, and Phil Coulson from earlier MCU films; as those characters were all killed in their previous appearances, Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter described the film as a unique opportunity to \"strengthen the presence of [the characters] who may not have lived up to their potential\".[117] Marvel also announced that Algenis Perez Soto, Rune Temte, and Mckenna Grace had been cast,[14][28] and revealed that Boden, Fleck, and the writing team of Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch had all contributed to the film's screenplay in addition to LeFauve, Perlman, and Robertson-Dworet.[14] Bek Smith, who previously was a member of Marvel's screenwriter program, performed uncredited rewrites during production.[118]\n\nPrincipal photography began on March 19 in Los Angeles,[119] at Sony Studios under the working title Open World.[120][121] Schwartz stated that Open World was chosen because it likened the film to an open world video game that could go in many directions, which is how the production felt about Captain Marvel's story at the time.[24] A 1986 carnival scene was filmed later that week at the Jim Hall Racing Club in Oxnard, California.[122] Filming of Captain Marvel in Los Angeles, along with other big-budget films that took advantage of California's improved tax credit program, helped raise on-location feature film production in the area by 11.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, the first such double-figure increase since the fourth quarter of 2015.[123] Filming at Shaver Lake outside Fresno, California, was set to take place in April[124] but was pushed back to mid-May.[125][126] In late April, Feige stated that almost half of filming was completed.[22] The following month, Annette Bening joined the cast in an undisclosed role.[35] Additional location shooting in and around the Los Angeles area included Simi Valley, Edwards Air Force Base, and Lucerne Valley.[127] In late June, production moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana and New Orleans for two weeks.[14][128] A realistic cat puppet was used on set since Larson is allergic to cats.[129] Scenes featuring the interior of the Quadjet were filmed on the set used to depict the interior of Quinjets on the MCU television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.[130] Filming concluded on July 6.[131]\n\nCinematographer Ben Davis shot primarily on large-format Arri Alexa 65 cameras, liking how the camera rendered the film's costumes.[132] Davis, who previously served as director of photography for Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Doctor Strange (2016),[14] noted that there was a \"point of departure\" in the visuals of Captain Marvel coming from its 1990s setting.[133] To achieve the 1990s aesthetic, Davis first attempted to utilize post-production techniques to convey a period look, but found that it just softened the image. He then tried using vintage Cooke Panchro and Canon K-35 lenses, but they were not compatible with the large format of the Arri Alexa camera system.[134] Davis ultimately enlisted Dan Sasaki of Panavision to make new lenses for the period scenes that could work with the cameras. Davis initially intended not to use these lenses for scenes set in space, to differentiate them, but found himself using the lenses for some close-ups set in space because he liked the way they looked.[132]\n\nAdditional photography was confirmed to have begun via set photos in late November 2018.[135] With the release of the theatrical poster in early December, Marvel revealed that the writing team of Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse had worked on the film's story, while Jac Schaeffer had contributed to the screenplay.[136] Schaeffer had previously been hired by Marvel to write Black Widow (2021).[137] Bening's and Law's roles were officially confirmed in February 2019 as the Supreme Intelligence and Yon-Rogg, respectively.[36][42]\n\nThe film was edited by Elliot Graham and Debbie Berman, marking Berman's third time co-editing an MCU film after Spider-Man: Homecoming and Black Panther.[138] Captain Marvel was edited using Avid Media Composer software in the Avid DNxHD codec on Apple computers.[139] Berman first became involved with the film when she was working on Homecoming and Boden and Fleck were hired, and was hired herself for Captain Marvel the first week she was working on Black Panther.[138] In addition to Graham and Berman, the editing team was made up of first assistants Jessica Baclesse and Kimberly Boritz, second assistants Basuki Juwono and Christos Voutsinas, and assistant editor Joe Galdo, among others. Berman spoke fondly of this large team, feeling that they gave her the opportunity to focus on the film's story rather than the technical aspects of editing.[139]\n\nVisual effects for the film were created by Animal Logic, Cantina Creative, Digital Domain, Framestore, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Rise, Rising Sun Pictures, Scanline VFX, Trixter, and Elastic,[141] with Lola VFX working on the de-aging of Jackson and Gregg.[142] Lola looked at several of Jackson's films, including Pulp Fiction (1994), Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), Jurassic Park (1993), Loaded Weapon 1 (1993), and One Eight Seven (1997), as a reference for his de-aging. However, some of these films were disqualified due to circumstances surrounding the character Jackson was playing: Pulp Fiction because of the character's wig and facial hair, and Jurassic Park because the character was made to appear older in that film. Lola VFX supervisor Trent Claus said the final look was based partly on Die Hard and Loaded Weapon 1, but mostly on One Eight Seven, which he described as the \"hero movie\". Jackson was de-aged approximately 25 years from the age of 70 at the time of filming, to 45 for the 1995 setting. To do this, both Jackson and Gregg had tracking dots applied to their faces during filming for which the VFX team could anchor the \"hand-crafted\" facial features that were composited primarily in Autodesk Flame. Lola's team included 40 primary compositors with another 15–20 junior compositors, and created approximately 500 different VFX shots, of which 385 made it in the final cut of film.[140] It was the first time Lola de-aged an actor without using a body double, as it would take too long to re-film all of Fury's scenes with the double.[143]\n\nTrixter did initial development on the look of Danvers' Binary powers and contributed the majority of visual effects for Goose the Cat, including movements that were impossible for real-life cats to act. ILM handled Goose's alien features, as well as much of the final battle for which they used Trixter's work on the Binary powers as well as inspiration from comic books, video games,[144] and anime.[145] ILM also did work on the Supreme Intelligence's virtual environment alongside Animal Logic, who took inspiration from the interior of the Louvre Abu Dhabi and the work they did with fractals for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017). These scenes were filmed in a white room without green or blue screen, so Animal Logic had to rotoscope the actors out of the footage and place them in the digital environment. To maintain the quality of the actors' hair during this process, Animal Logic created digital hair for Larson and Bening. Luma Pictures was primarily responsible for the train chase sequence, nicknamed the \"French Connection\" scene after the 1971 film of the same name. They had to make the footage look as if it were continuing along a single train line even though the sequence was filmed in multiple locations around Los Angeles. Digital Domain worked on the Skrull transformation sequences, Rise created the exterior environment of Hala, and Framestore handled the battle sequence on Torfa. Rising Sun handled all of the Kree forearm holograms, the interior of the Project Pegasus hangar, and the exterior of the Quadjet. Scanline worked on effects for the aerial chases and the accident scene where Danvers gains her powers. Elastic created the end titles, and The Third Floor, Inc. provided previsualization and postvisualization work.[144]\n\nThe film's mid-credits scene shows Captain Marvel meeting the Avengers, and was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Boden described it as a lead-in to the Russo's Avengers: Endgame.[6] For Captain Marvel, Marvel Studios modified their production logo to honor Stan Lee, who died on November 12, 2018, by replacing the characters in the logo with Lee's MCU cameos. The logo is followed by a black screen reading \"Thank You Stan\". Feige said this was done because the film was Marvel's first since Lee died, and they wanted to start the film by acknowledging him with a celebration of his legacy rather than add a somber memorial to the end of the film.[146]\n\nPinar Toprak signed on to compose the film's score in June 2018, making her the first woman to score an MCU film.[147] Toprak began by creating the title character's theme, before developing themes for the Kree and the Skrulls, whom she tried to connect in order to \"find the universe\" for the film's scenes in space and Earth.[148] Toprak wanted Captain Marvel's theme to be recognizable from its first two notes.[148] In addition to Toprak's score, the film's soundtrack includes Alan Silvestri's theme from The Avengers (2012);[149] Michael Giacchino's Marvel Studios Fanfare, which is played over the Marvel Studios logo and referenced during Stan Lee's cameo appearance;[150] and songs from the 1990s.[40]\n\nIn April 2019, Mark Salcido of the website Screen Geek alleged that Marvel and the film's directors had been unhappy with Toprak's work on the film even after she had responded to \"ample\" notes, and had replaced her as composer for the film with Giacchino.[151] Giacchino responded to this report by confirming he was involved in the film, revealing that he had been asked to give feedback on Toprak's work while he was working with Marvel on the score for Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). He thought Toprak had written a \"beautiful theme and an inspiring score\" for the film and had helped her work on \"a few cues\" which he said was him supporting her as a fellow member of the Marvel \"family\". Giacchino made it clear that he \"did not write the score to Captain Marvel ... bottom line is [Toprak] is a fabulous composer and certainly doesn't need me\".[152]\n\nIn 2017, concept art from the film was shown at San Diego Comic-Con,[20] and a first look at Larson as Danvers was revealed at CineEurope.[153] Larson debuted the first trailer for the film that September at the National Air and Space Museum on Good Morning America.[154] Petrana Radulovic of Polygon felt the trailer showed \"large-scale action and intergalactic mayhem that reaches for Infinity War's heights\",[155] while Ben Kuchera, also of Polygon, approved of opening the trailer with Blockbuster Video since its logo is identifiable to the audience. Kuchera also compared the \"sun-drenched\" Air Force pilot sequences to Top Gun.[156] Devan Coogan of Entertainment Weekly called the trailer \"a powerful introduction to the MCU's first solo female hero\".[157] Graeme McMillian of The Hollywood Reporter felt the prominent narration by Nick Fury \"grounds the trailer in something—someone—familiar for the Marvel faithful\", but said the changes to the character's origin story were \"a risky proposition\" to long-time fans of the character.[158] Richard Newby, also of The Hollywood Reporter, noted that the character's unfamiliarity to audiences was not presented as a joke in the trailer as with Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man (2015), and commended Davis for its more grounded look than previous MCU films.[159] The trailer did receive some criticism, including that the plot presented was unclear, confusion as to why Danvers punches an elderly woman, and objections to Danvers not smiling much.[160] The trailer was viewed 109 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the 11th most viewed trailer in that time period.[161]\n\nThe second trailer debuted on December 3, 2018, during halftime of the Monday Night Football game between the Washington Redskins and the Philadelphia Eagles.[136] McMillian felt the trailer too overtly responded to online criticisms of the first, including clarification that \"the elderly lady Carol punches was a Skrull\", more shots of her smiling, and \"additional emphasis on both explaining the plot and establishing Carol Danvers as a character\". McMillian compared the contents and structure of the two Captain Marvel trailers to those for Thor (2011) and Captain America: The First Avenger.[160] Newby felt the second trailer \"offers increased action and a more in-depth look at the mythology surrounding\" Captain Marvel, but criticized it for not helping to introduce the film's supporting characters. He compared the trailer to a superhero version of John Carpenter's Starman (1984), explaining, \"Explosions, space battles, and superpowers may bring in the crowds, but it's moments [of] humanity and introspection that will allow Captain Marvel to leave her mark and encourage audiences to care about the mystery surrounding who she is.\"[162] On December 8, Larson participated in a panel at CCXP in Brazil, where she shared footage and an extended trailer from the film and presented an exclusive poster for the event.[163] By January 3, 2019, BoxOffice revealed their \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 66–70% of people surveyed who viewed the Captain Marvel trailer in the past two weeks expressed interest in seeing the film. In the two weeks it was measured by \"Trailer Impact\", it was number two for both, behind Avengers: Endgame, and had some of the highest percentage of respondents express interest in seeing the film ever for the service. \"Trailer Impact\" usually includes films 10 weeks out from release, but BoxOffice decided to add Captain Marvel to the survey 12 weeks out.[164]\n\nIn January 2019, the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe announced the #CaptainMarvelChallenge, a campaign to purchase tickets and refreshments for girls and chaperones at the Greater Los Angeles chapter of Girls, Inc. The campaign, inspired by the success of the #BlackPantherChallenge which raised more than $50,000 for children to watch Black Panther, came after Brie Larson suggested on Twitter that there should be a similar campaign for Captain Marvel.[165] For the film's press tour, Larson noted she would be \"pushing for representation across the board: my interviews, magazine covers, the clothes that I'm wearing\" as part of her support for inclusiveness and opposition to sexual harassment in Hollywood.[166] In February, a commercial for the film aired during the television broadcast of Super Bowl LIII. Bruce Fretts of The New York Times listed the commercial as one of the best advertisements to air during the telecast, stating, \"The commercial introduces a new catchphrase—'higher, further, faster'—and lives up to it with a lightning-quick montage that sets pulses racing.\"[167] CBS charged $5.25 million for each 30-second advertisement that aired during the game.[168] Also in February, Alaska Airlines unveiled a Captain Marvel-themed Boeing 737-800 jet, featuring the film's logo on the side and images of Goose the Cat on its wings. The plane debuted at the Seattle–Tacoma International Airport before its first flight to Orange County, California.[169] At the end of the month, an hour-long video of Goose was livestreamed on Marvel's YouTube channel.[170]\n\nCaptain Marvel premiered in London on February 27, 2019,[171] and in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on March 4.[172] The Hollywood premiere included a flyover by the United States Air Force Thunderbirds in honor of Thunderbirds pilot Major Stephen Del Bagno,[173] who consulted with Larson on the film before dying in a training accident in April 2018.[15] The film was released in the United States on March 8,[74] coinciding with International Women's Day.[174] It was also released in IMAX and 3D formats.[175][176] It was originally scheduled for release on July 6, 2018,[58] but in February 2015 it was moved to November 2, 2018, to make room for Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017),[61] and in October 2015 it was pushed to its final March 2019 date for Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018).[177] The film's release in Pakistan was delayed for four weeks.[178] At the time, Disney's South Asia division, which is headquartered in India, had not given Pakistan the rights to distribute it. Commentators online speculated that this was due to ongoing Indo-Pakistani tensions, but Disney South Asia head Nadeem Mandviwalla called this statement \"baseless\".[179] Captain Marvel is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[180]\n\nCaptain Marvel was the first Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures-distributed film not to stream on Netflix, after Disney let their licensing deal with Netflix expire. It became the first theatrical Disney release to stream exclusively on Disney+, which launched on November 12, 2019.[181] The film was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on May 28, 2019, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on June 11. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, and gag reels.[182] Captain Marvel has made over $64.2 million from video sales in the U.S.[183] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[184]\n\nCaptain Marvel grossed $426.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $701.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.128 billion.[4] It had a worldwide opening of $456.7 million, the sixth-biggest of all time, and the biggest opening for a female-led film.[185] Deadline Hollywood estimated that the film had a total production and advertising cost of $300 million.[2] It is the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019.[186] On April 2, 2019, the film crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide, becoming the first female-led superhero movie to do so,[187] as well as the seventh Marvel title, the 19th Disney film, and 38th film overall.[188] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $414 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it fifth on their list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[189]\n\nThe film's first 24 hours of advance ticket sales, which began on January 7, 2019, ranked third on Fandango for an MCU film, behind Avengers: Infinity War and Black Panther, and second on Atom Tickets, behind Infinity War.[190] According to Fandango, Captain Marvel had the third-largest advanced ticket sales of any MCU film, behind Infinity War and Black Panther, and surpassed Wonder Woman and Aquaman (2018) during the same time period.[191] The film made $61.4 million on its first day, including $20.7 million from Thursday night previews, which was the fifth-highest total for a Marvel film and second-highest for a March release, behind Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). It made $153.4 million over its opening weekend, making this the third-best March opening, after Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Beauty and the Beast (2017), as well as seventh-highest of the MCU.[2] Captain Marvel would hold the record for having the highest opening weekend for a female-directed film until it was surpassed by Barbie four years later in 2023.[192] The film remained in first place during its second weekend, with $69.3 million, the second-highest sophomore weekend in March, behind Beauty and the Beast.[193] The film grossed $35.2 million in its third weekend, dropping to second, behind Us.[194] In the following weeks it dropped to third, fifth, sixth, and fourth, before rising to second again in its eighth weekend with the release of Avengers: Endgame.[195] Captain Marvel finished its box office run as the sixth highest-grossing film of 2019 in this region.[196]\n\nOn its first day of international release, the film made $5.9 million in South Korea and $1.7 million in France, as well as $2.51 million from Thursday night previews in China, the fourth-best for an MCU film in the country. Through its first two days of release in foreign territories the film made $44 million, including $9.1 million in South Korea, $3 million in Brazil, $2.9 million in France and $2.5 million in Australia. It also grossed $34 million on its first day in China, the third-best superhero opening day ever in the country. The film went on to have a foreign opening weekend of $302.4 million, the fifth-best of all time. Its largest markets were China ($89.3 million), South Korea ($24.1 million), the UK ($16.8 million), Brazil ($13.4 million, the second-best opening of any film in the country's history) and Mexico ($12.8 million, fifth-best ever).[185] Through its first 12 days of release, the film's highest-grossing foreign countries were China ($135.7 million), South Korea ($37.5 million), the United Kingdom ($32.9 million), Brazil ($26.1 million) and Mexico ($25.7 million).[197] By April 2, the film's largest foreign markets were China ($152.3 million), South Korea ($43.7 million), the UK ($43.3 million), Brazil ($34.5 million) and Mexico ($31.8 million).[188]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 79%, with an average score of 6.8/10, based on 552 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Packed with action, humor, and visual thrills, Captain Marvel introduces the MCU's latest hero with an origin story that makes effective use of the franchise's signature formula.\"[198] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100 based on 56 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[199] According to The New York Times, the film's overall reception was \"fairly positive\", but it wasn't as well-received as other films in the MCU.[200] The Hindustan Times, collating multiple reviews of the film, noted praise for Brie Larson's performance but also criticism for the film's \"convoluted plot and lack of originality\".[201]\n\nKenneth Turan, writing for the Los Angeles Times, lauded Larson's performance and the direction of Boden and Fleck, saying, \"Marvel has come to recognize, as this film proves, that even effects-heavy behemoths can benefit from a directing touch that is human, not programmatic, that understands character and nuance and can create scenes with an emotional heft we might not expect.\"[203] A.O. Scott of The New York Times said the film was \"not too long, not too self-important, and benefits from the craft and talent of a cast that includes Annette Bening, Jude Law, and Ben Mendelsohn\".[204] Writing for Variety, Owen Gleiberman also praised the film's direction. He said that Boden and Fleck had not been able to retain their signature style of \"low-key American neorealis[m]\", but was still positive about how they were able to create a film with \"enough tricks and moods and sleight-of-hand layers to keep us honestly absorbed\" within the house style of the MCU.[205] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, and said it was a \"real treat\" to follow the origin stories of both Carol Danvers and Nick Fury.[206] Rolling Stone's Peter Travers gave it four stars and praised Larson's performance for bringing \"layers of feeling to a role that a lesser actress might have let slide by on pyrotechnics. You see how she lays the foundation for a character who defies male objectification and becomes akin to what Joni Mitchell called 'a woman of heart and mind.'\"[207] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker stated, \"Superhero cinema has lectured us, ad infinitum, on the responsibility that is conferred by extraordinary gifts. Praise be to Larson, for reminding us that they can be bringers of fun.\"[208]\n\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter described the film as \"mundane, marked by unimaginative plotting, cut-rate villains, a bland visual style and a lack of elan in every department\".[209] David Ehrlich at IndieWire gave the film a 'C−' grade and called it \"neither a blast from the past, nor an inspiring glimpse into the future ... it's just another Marvel movie. And not a particularly good one\". Ehrlich praised Mendelsohn, saying he gave the best performance in the film.[210] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said Danvers \"is a candidate for genuine heroism\" but found a \"fundamental dissonance between the depth of her plight and the shallow disorganization of the script\".[211] The A.V. Club's Ignatiy Vishnevetsky was disappointed by the film, finding it to be \"everything you might expect a sci-fi superhero movie to be, if you hadn't seen one in a long time\".[212] Richard Brody of The New Yorker compared the film to a political commercial that \"packs a worthy message [but] hardly counts as an aesthetic experience. The message of the film is conveyed less through the story than through its casting.\"[213]\n\nIn late December 2018, the film was named as the most anticipated 2019 film by IMDb, the most anticipated new standalone comic book film and the second-most anticipated blockbuster of 2019 according to Fandango,[214] and the second-most anticipated superhero and overall film by Atom Tickets.[215]\n\nAhead of the film's release, Captain Marvel's \"Want to See\" score—an audience anticipation poll on Rotten Tomatoes—had fallen to 28%.[216] Reports described the decline as an effort to review bomb the film's page with negative comments attacking the film and Larson for their perceived feminism.[217] Rotten Tomatoes changed the \"Want to See\" feature shortly after, showing only the number of people indicating interest in the film instead of a percentage. The announcement said this was part of a larger redesign of the site, and that the \"Want to See\" feature would be restored once the film was released.[216][218] By 8:00 a.m. on opening day in the United States, the film held a 33% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes from more than 58,000 reviews, which was more audience reviews than Avengers: Infinity War had during its entire theatrical run. Analysts attributed the low score and sheer number of reviews to online trolling. Rotten Tomatoes later said a bug was responsible for the high count of reviews, and by 1:00 p.m. the number of counted ratings was down to 7,000 with an audience score of 35%.[219]\n\nAudiences of the film polled by CinemaScore gave it an average grade of \"A\" on a scale of A+ to F, while PostTrak reported that 73% of filmgoers gave it a \"definite recommend\". 58% said it met their expectations, while 35% said it exceeded them. Unlike Wonder Woman, which was watched by more women than men, Captain Marvel's initial audience was 61% male, according to PostTrak. Discussing these statistics, Deadline Hollywood's Anthony D'Alessandro praised CinemaScore and PostTrak for taking scientific polls that actually identified how the audience was feeling about the film, and criticized the Rotten Tomatoes audience score as an \"ancient 1990s means of collecting opinions online\" that is influenced by \"ugly Internet troll noise\".[2]\n\nThe film was recognized with The ReFrame Stamp for hiring people of underrepresented gender identities, and of color.[238]\n\nThe Marvels was released on November 10, 2023,[239] with Nia DaCosta directing and Megan McDonnell writing the script.[240][241] Larson reprises her role,[241] and is joined by Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan / Ms. Marvel and Teyonah Parris as a grown-up Monica Rambeau, both reprising their roles from Disney+ series.[242] Zawe Ashton appears as the villain.[243]\n"

        "content": "\n\nAvengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast which includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in Infinity War which erased half of all life in the universe.\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2, but Marvel Studios later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. It is a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs of several main characters. The film's plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and downtown Atlanta areas, New York State, Scotland, and England. The official title was announced in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever produced.\n\nAvengers: Endgame premiered at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26 as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action scenes, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. It grossed $2.799 billion worldwide, surpassing Infinity War's entire theatrical run in eleven days and setting a number of box-office records; it was the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 to March 2021. The film was nominated for Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Two further films, Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars, are scheduled for release in 2026 and 2027, respectively.\n\nIn 2018, 23 days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe,[a] Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space. They reunite with the remaining Avengers—Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes—and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions but find that Thanos has destroyed them. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\n\nFive years later, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm.[b] Reaching the Avengers Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm allows time travel, they ask a reluctant Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse Thanos's present actions. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past does not affect the present; any changes create alternate realities. Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugee settlement of New Asgard and recruit an overweight, despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante after the erasure of his family.\n\nBanner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012.[c] At the Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the Infinity Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra sleeper agents; Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and sees his lost love, Peggy Carter.\n\nRocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013;[d] Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster. Thor is encouraged by his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can,[e] while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, says that it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self; this allows 2014-Thanos to learn about his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival.\n\nReuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket have built. Banner, who has the most resistance to their radiation, uses the gauntlet to undo Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula (impersonating her future self) uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present and destroys the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers; he summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos's army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, sacrificing himself.\n\nAfter Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new king of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.\n\nSeveral actors from Infinity War reprise their roles in Endgame, including Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange,[53] Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther,[54] Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Zoe Saldaña as Gamora,[41] Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff,[55] Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon,[56] Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier,[57] Tom Hiddleston as Loki,[58] Pom Klementieff as Mantis,[59] Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer,[41] Letitia Wright as Shuri,[60] William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill,[41] Winston Duke as M'Baku,[61] Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw,[41] Jacob Batalon as Ned,[62] Vin Diesel as Groot,[41] Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord,[55] Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ross Marquand as Red Skull / Stonekeeper, Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive, Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian,[41] and Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's suit AI F.R.I.D.A.Y.[63] Monique Ganderton again provided motion capture for Proxima Midnight.[41]\n\nAlso reprising their roles from previous MCU films were Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne / Wasp,[64] Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, Rene Russo as Frigga, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Marisa Tomei as May Parker, Taika Waititi as Korg,[62] Angela Bassett as Ramonda,[41] Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hernández as Jasper Sitwell,[62] Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow,[65] Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Callan Mulvey as Jack Rollins, and Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener.[62] Sean Gunn reprised his role as Kraglin and was credited for the role,[66] although he is not clearly visible in the film.[67] Natalie Portman appears as Jane Foster in footage from a deleted Thor: The Dark World (2013) scene and a voiceover when Foster is talking in the distance.[68] James D'Arcy reprised his role as Edwin Jarvis from the MCU television series Agent Carter, the first time a character introduced in an MCU television series appeared in an MCU film.[69]\n\nHiroyuki Sanada played Akihiko, a Yakuza boss in Tokyo who opposes Barton. Lexi Rabe played Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter.[41][66] Katherine Langford was cast as an older Morgan, but her scene was cut from the final film.[70][71] Emma Fuhrmann played an older Cassie Lang, Scott's daughter, after the character was played as a child by Abby Ryder Fortson in previous MCU films.[72] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee had a posthumous cameo in the film, digitally de-aged as a car driver in 1970, in his final film appearance.[73] Ken Jeong and Yvette Nicole Brown had cameo appearances as a storage facility guard and a S.H.I.E.L.D. employee, respectively.[62] Co-director Joe Russo (credited as Gozie Agbo) had a cameo appearance as a grieving gay man, the first appearance of an openly homosexual character in an MCU film.[74] Joe's daughters Ava and Lia Russo played Barton's daughter Lila and a fan of Hulk, respectively. Thanos creator Jim Starlin also appeared as a grieving man.[75] The character Howard the Duck appeared in a non-speaking cameo.[76]\n\nIn October 2014, Marvel Studios announced a two-part sequel of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) entitled Avengers: Infinity War. Part 1 was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, and Part 2 was scheduled for May 3, 2019.[77] Marvel's plan was to film both parts of Infinity War back-to-back.[78] Anthony and Joe Russo were hired to direct the films in April 2015.[79] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write screenplays for both parts of the film.[80] Producer Kevin Feige said that the sequel was titled as two parts of a single film because of shared elements but they would be \"two distinct\" projects, not one story split across two films.[81] The Russos decided to re-title the two films to remove any misconceptions in May 2016,[82] and Marvel left the second film untitled that July.[83] Feige and the Russo brothers indicated that the title was being withheld because it would give away plot details for this film and Infinity War.[84][85]\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 10, 2017,[86] under the working title Mary Lou 2[87] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with Trent Opaloch the director of photography.[88][89] The film and Infinity War were shot with ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, the first time a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.[90] Filming was done that month in the Gulch area of downtown Atlanta, near the Five Points MARTA station, and in Piedmont Park.[91] Feige said that the films were originally scheduled to be filmed simultaneously but were ultimately shot back-to-back: \"It became too complicated to cross-board them like that, and we found ourselves—again, something would always pay the price. We wanted to be able to focus and shoot one movie and then focus and shoot another movie.\"[92] Anthony Russo originally felt that it made more sense to shoot the films simultaneously for financial and logistical reasons (including the large number of cast members),[93] and had suggested that \"some days we'll be shooting the first movie and some days we'll be shooting the second movie. Just jumping back and forth.\"[88] The 2013 Asgard scenes were shot at Durham Cathedral in Durham, England during production of Infinity War in early May 2017.[94][95] Production wrapped on January 11, 2018,[96] although additional filming took place in New York's Dutchess and Ulster counties in June 2018.[97] Re-shoots began by September 7, 2018,[98] and ended on October 12.[99] More re-shoots were done in January 2019.[100] Location shooting also took place in St Abbs, Scotland, which doubled for New Asgard in Norway.[101] Evans and Hemsworth earned $15 million each for the film.[102]\n\nThe film's official title, Avengers: Endgame, and final U.S. release date of April 26, 2019, were revealed with the film's first trailer in December 2018.[103] Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital, DNEG, Framestore, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, Cantina Creative, Capital T, Technicolor VFX, and Territory Studio.[104] Like previous MCU films, Lola worked on the de-aging scenes; the film has 200 de-aging and aging shots.[105] Downey, Evans, Ruffalo, Hemsworth, Johansson, and Renner were de-aged to their 2012 appearances for scenes recreated from The Avengers (2012).[106] Michael Douglas, John Slattery, and Stan Lee were also de-aged for the 1970 New Jersey scene,[73][107] and Douglas's appearance in The Streets of San Francisco was referenced.[108] Lola aged Evans for the final scene, where he is an elderly man, with make-up and a stand-in.[106] Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt were the film's editors.[109]\n\nAlan Silvestri, who composed the score for The Avengers, was announced in June 2016 to be returning to score Infinity War and Endgame.[110] The Russos began working with Silvestri on the Endgame score in early November 2018,[111] and it was completed in late March 2019.[112] A soundtrack album with Silvestri's score was released digitally by Hollywood Records on April 26, 2019, with a physical release on May 24.[113] A video for the track \"Portals\", composed for the climactic \"Avengers assemble\" scene in which reinforcements arrive for the Avengers, was released on June 13.[114]\n\nSilvestri described the score as having the franchise's most versatile tone, ranging from \"thunderous percussion and powerful brass\" for the action scenes to minimalist, jazz-inspired music for Ant-Man and the Quantum Realm. He reprised his themes from the previous Avengers films and Captain America: The First Avenger, including material he wrote for Thanos and the Infinity Stones in Infinity War. Silvestri found writing the music to end Captain America's story poignant, since he had \"been on this journey with him since the beginning\".[115] The film also used the Ant-Man (2015) theme by Christophe Beck, the Doctor Strange (2016) theme by Michael Giacchino, and the Captain Marvel theme by Pinar Toprak.[116] The songs \"Come and Get Your Love\" by Redbone and \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn were also used after previously being heard in Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), respectively.[117][118]\n\nThe marketing campaign for Endgame cost over $200 million, the most for any Marvel Studios film. Promotional partners included Stand Up to Cancer, Mastercard, Ulta Beauty, the Audi e-tron GT concept car (which appears in the film), McDonald's, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Google, General Mills, Hertz, Ziploc, Oppo, and Synchrony Financial.[119] A year before the film's release, Germain Lussier of io9 spoke on the approach Marvel might have to take in marketing the film, given the end of Infinity War where many established characters die. He questioned if those characters would appear on posters and in toy campaigns, and if the actors playing them would participate in press events leading up to the film's release. Lussier felt that Disney and Marvel could focus on the original Avengers team members (most of the living characters), but noted that it would be more beneficial to show the return of the dead characters; this would create a \"mystery and curiosity about how they come back\" and a \"whole new level of interest\" for the film \"while having all the stars front and center\".[120] Feige said in June 2018 that the dead characters would not be featured in the film's marketing.[121] He presented a behind-the-scenes video from the film at CineEurope,[122][123] and said that its marketing campaign would begin at the end of 2018.[124] In early December 2018, before the first trailer's release, Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter spoke about the \"fevered anticipation\" surrounding it and felt it \"remarkable\", mostly \"fan-created, without [the] noticeable direction from Marvel or the filmmakers involved\"; knowledge about the film, without promotion was, \"a kind of brand awareness\" that was unusual. McMillan urged Marvel not to release any trailers for the film, since \"the advanced level of enthusiasm [...] [was] likely to build\" before its release; a trailer would take away the \"Schrödinger's cat-esque position\", as it was \"almost guaranteed\" to disappoint fans.[125]\n\nThe first trailer for the film was released on December 7, 2018.[126] Dustin Sandoval, vice president of digital marketing for Marvel Studios, said that the marketing team \"made the choice\" to omit the \"title or hashtag\" for the film in its trailer posts, allowing fans to see the trailer without spoiling it by watching \"at the end\".[127] Richard Newby, also of The Hollywood Reporter, felt that although little new material was revealed in the trailer, it offered a \"somber glimpse of a universe made unrecognizable\" and let the viewer consider \"the ending of Avengers: Infinity War and our questions of loss\". Newby noted that the trailer highlighted the characters' \"humble beginnings\" with its visual language, and left viewers with \"just as many questions as we had before\".[126] Austen Goslin of Polygon said that the title references a line by Doctor Strange to Tony Stark in Infinity War and a line by Stark in Age of Ultron. Goslin said, \"The scene surrounding this line in Age of Ultron is one of the most important ones in the movie. Things look dark, and the group of heroes face an enemy they don't think they can defeat.\" The Endgame trailer \"mirrors this perfectly\", and \"shows us that the Avengers' two most prominent characters are who they've always been: Iron Man, a pessimist who keeps fighting no matter how hopeless things look, and Captain America, an optimist who believes that nothing is hopeless when the world's heroes fight together.\"[128] The trailer was viewed 289 million times in its first 24 hours and was the most-viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of Avengers: Infinity War (230 million views). It set a record for Twitter conversation for a film trailer in the first 24 hours, generating 549,000 mentions.[129] By January 3, 2019, BoxOffice's \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated that 77 to 78 percent of people surveyed who viewed the Endgame trailer in the past three weeks had expressed interest in seeing the film. In the three weeks it was measured by the service, the trailer was number one for all and had the top two percent of respondents express interest in seeing the film since the service's introduction in March 2018.[130]\n\nThe second trailer for the film and its theatrical release poster were released on March 14, 2019. All 13 actors on the poster received top billing except for Danai Gurira, whose name appeared in the poster's bottom billing block with Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, and Gwyneth Paltrow (none of whom appeared on the poster). Despite this, her exclusion from the top billing prompted criticism from some fans.[38][131] Petrana Radulovic of Polygon said that how an actor is credited on a poster \"is a complex process\" based on \"dealing with agents, fees, and movie star demands.\"[38] Marvel Studios released an updated poster later that day, with Gurira in the top billing.[38][131] The second trailer was viewed 268 million times in the first 24 hours, becoming the second-most-viewed trailer in that time period (behind the first trailer).[132]\n\nAvengers: Endgame had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019.[133][134] Disney converted the convention center's Hall K for the film's premiere, working with Dolby and QSC Audio to install a 70-foot (21-metre) screen, Dolby Vision projectors, and a Dolby Atmos sound system. The convention center also held the red carpet arrival and after-party for the premiere.[134] The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24,[135] in the United Kingdom on April 25,[136] in the United States and India on April 26,[103][135] and in Russia on April 29[135] in IMAX and 3D.[137][138] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3.[77] Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films.[139] Avengers: Endgame is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[140]\n\nFollowing the release of the second trailer for Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) on May 6, Marvel began showing it at the end of Endgame screenings with a message before the film from Far From Home star Tom Holland telling the audience to stay until the end of the credits to see the trailer.[141] In June, Feige announced that Avengers: Endgame would be re-released in theaters with seven minutes of new post-credits footage which included a Stan Lee tribute, an unfinished deleted scene, and the opening scene of Far From Home. A limited-edition poster would be given out at select theaters. The re-release began on June 28 in 1,040 theaters in the United States.[142][143]\n\nThe film was released for digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 30, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 13.[144] Streaming became exclusive to Disney+ on November 12, 2021.[145] The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[144] Despite being filmed with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home-media release has the cropped 2.39:1 aspect-ratio version used for non-IMAX screenings.[146] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ on November 12, 2021,[147] and it earned $107.8 million from DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US.[3]\n\nAvengers: Endgame grossed $858.4 million in the United States and Canada and $1.941 billion in other territories for a worldwide total of $2.799 billion.[4] It was the highest-grossing film of all time[148] until it was surpassed by Avatar (2009) due to the 2021 re-release in China,[149] and was the second-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada.[150] Gone with the Wind (1939) remains the highest-grossing film (adjusted for inflation), and Avengers: Endgame is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide.[151]\n\nThe film had a worldwide opening of $1.2 billion, the biggest of all time, and nearly double Infinity War's previous record of $640 million.[152] It is the fastest film to reach the $1 billion and $1.5 billion marks, doing so in five and eight days respectively.[153] Deadline Hollywood estimated that the film would break even five days after release, \"unheard of for a major studio tentpole during its opening weekend\".[2] The website calculated Avengers: Endgame's final net profit as $890 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participation, and other costs; box-office grosses and home-media revenue placed it first on its list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[154]\n\nOn May 4, the film's earnings at the global box office surpassed the theatrical run of Infinity War. It was the fastest film to gross $2 billion worldwide, reaching that threshold in 11 days; Avatar did so in 47 days.[155] Avengers: Endgame was the fifth film to surpass this threshold (after Avatar, Titanic (1997), Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), and Infinity War),[156] and reached the $2.5 billion mark in 20 days; Avatar did so in 72.[157]\n\nEndgame was one of 2019's most anticipated films of 2019 in late December 2018, ranked second by IMDb and first by Fandango and Atom Tickets.[158][159] Due to high demand when pre-sale tickets became available in the U.S. on April 2, 2019, customers on Atom Tickets and Fandango experienced long wait times and system delays; AMC Theatres' website and app crashed for several hours. Fandango announced that day that the film was its top-selling pre-sale title for the first 24 hours, breaking Star Wars: The Force Awakens's record in six hours. Atom said that the film was the website's bestselling first-day film (outselling Aquaman (2018) by four times), and Regal Cinemas reported that Endgame had sold more tickets in its first eight hours than Infinity War did in its first week.[160] The film grossed $120–140 million in pre-sales.[135] Fandango announced the day before release that Endgame was its biggest pre-selling title of all time, surpassing The Force Awakens with over 8,000 sold-out showtimes across the US.[161]\n\nIn India, the film sold one million tickets in one day for its English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu-language screenings; 18 tickets were sold every second.[135] In China, pre-sale tickets became available on April 12; a record one million were sold in six hours, surpassing Infinity War's first-24-hours total in the first hour[162] and earning $114.5 million (RMB 770 million) in pre-sales.[163]\n\nOn April 4, industry tracking projected that the film would gross $200–250 million domestically during its opening weekend; some insiders saw those figures as conservative, and expected a $260–300 million debut.[164][165] By the week of its release, domestic estimates had risen to $260–270 million and some insiders suggested that a $300 million debut was possible. The film played in 4,662 theaters, 410 of which were in IMAX; it was the widest release ever, surpassing the record of Despicable Me 3's (2017) 4,529 theaters.[135][166] Avengers: Endgame earned $357.1 million in its opening weekend, breaking Infinity War's record by nearly $100 million. It set records for Friday ($157.5 million, including $60 million from Thursday night previews), Saturday ($109.3 million), and Sunday ($90.4 million) totals, and had a higher total weekend gross than the previous box-office high of all films combined ($314 million).[167] The film earned an average of $76,601 per theatre, breaking records for highest per-theatre average for a nationwide release ($59,982 for The Force Awakens) and the inflation-adjusted record held by Return of the Jedi (approximately $66,400, set in 1983).[168][169] It earned $36.9 million the following Monday and $33.1 million on Tuesday, both the third-highest of all time.[170][171] In its second weekend, the film made $147.4 million (the second-best second weekend ever) for a 10-day total of $621.3 million. It was the fastest film to pass the $600 million mark, ahead of The Force Awakens's 12 days and less than half the 26 days it took Infinity War.[172] The film grossed $64.8 million the following week, the fourth-best third weekend ever. It passed the $700 million mark, tying The Force Awakens's record of 16 days.[173] Endgame was finally dethroned in its fourth weekend by newcomer John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum (2019).[174] It earned $17.2 million the following weekend (a total of $22.3 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend), crossing the $800 million threshold domestically.[175] The film was added to 1,040 theaters during its tenth-weekend re-release and earned $6.1 million, an increase of 207 percent from the previous weekend.[176] It earned $1.2 million in its thirteenth weekend, breaking Avatar's all-time record.[177]\n\nEndgame was projected to gross around $680 million internationally over its first five days, for a global debut of $850–950 million.[178][179][135] The film was initially projected to gross $250–280 million in China in its opening weekend[135] but earned a record $107.5 million (RMB 719 million) in the country on its first day; this included $28.2 million (RMB 189 million) from midnight, 3 am and 6 am screenings, eclipsing The Fate of the Furious's (2017) record of $9.1 million. Due to the record-breaking first day and word of mouth (with a 9.1 on local review aggregator Douban and a 9.3 on ticket website Maoyan), debut projections were increased to over $300 million.[163] The film made $169 million on its first day, the highest total of all time. Its largest markets after China were India ($9 million), South Korea ($8.4 million, the largest non-holiday single-day gross ever), Australia ($7.1 million), France ($6 million), and Italy ($5.8 million). The film over-performed, opening with $866 million overseas. Its largest markets, setting records for the best-ever opening in each country, were China ($330.5 million, RMB 2.22 billion), the United Kingdom ($53.8 million), South Korea ($47.4 million), Mexico ($33.1 million), Australia ($30.8 million), Brazil ($26 million), Spain ($13.3 million), Japan ($13 million),[152] and Vietnam ($10 million).[180] The film earned $21.6 million over its first four days in Russia after a government-caused delay of its premiere.[139][181][182]\n\nIn its first week, the film's top five largest international markets were China ($459.4 million), the United Kingdom ($68.2 million), South Korea ($60.3 million), Mexico ($48.6 million), and India ($40.9 million).[183] A week after its release, it became the highest-grossing foreign film of all time in China[184] and India.[185] The film's running total passed $1.569 billion from international markets in its second weekend, passing Titanic as the second-highest film overseas of all time.[156] By January 2021, its top international markets were China ($632 million), the United Kingdom ($115 million), South Korea ($105 million), Brazil ($86 million), and Mexico ($78 million).[4]\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 94%, with an average score of 8.2/10 based on 557 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, Avengers: Endgame does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga.\"[187] Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) gave the film a score of 78 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[188] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an A+ grade on an A+-to-F scale, the third Marvel film to receive the grade after The Avengers and Black Panther (2018). PostTrak audiences gave the film five stars out of five and an 85-percent \"definite recommend\".[167]\n\nWriting for NPR, Glen Weldon gave the film a positive review and found it a worthy sequel to its predecessor: \"The Russos' decision to stick close to the experiences of the remaining Avengers proves a rewarding one, as they've expressly constructed the film as an extended victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe writ large. Got a favorite character from any Marvel movie over the past decade, no matter how obscure? Prepare to get serviced, fan.\"[189] In his Rolling Stone review, Peter Travers gave the film four stars out of five: \"You don't have to make jokes about the clichéd time travel plot – the film is ready, willing and able to make its own, with Back to the Future coming in for a serious ribbing.\"[190]\n\nPeter Debruge of Variety wrote, \"After the must-see showdown that was Infinity War, the Russo brothers deliver a more fan-facing three-hour follow-up, rewarding loyalty to Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"[191] J. R. Kinnard of PopMatters wrote, \"Big budget action filmmaking doesn't get much better than this.\"[192] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"[W]hat comes across most strongly here, oddly enough for an effects-driven comic-book-derived film, is the character acting, especially from Downey, Ruffalo, Evans, Hemsworth, Brolin, and Paul Rudd\".[193] Richard Roeper, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film four stars and praised its \"emotional punch\" and the \"funny, well-paced, smart, expertly rendered screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, crisp direction from Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, [...] and the universally stellar performances\".[194]\n\nThe New York Times reviewer A. O. Scott gave the film a positive-but-guarded review: \"Endgame is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it's really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work.\"[195] Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Avengers: Endgame achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis\".[196] Some called the film a notable improvement over its predecessor, Avengers: Infinity War, including Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com: Endgame is \"a more patient, focused film [than Infinity War], even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies.\"[197] Matt Zoller Seitz (also of RogerEbert.com) compared the film positively to Infinity War, which he considered \"too crowded, too rushed and yet too long\". Seitz called Endgame \"a heartfelt and satisfying experience\" and a \"surprisingly relaxed, character-driven, self-aware yet sincere comedy [for] two-thirds of [the film]. Much of the script suggests a laid-back Richard Linklater movie with superheroes\".[198] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal cited Avengers: Endgame as the conclusion of the Infinity Saga, calling the final battle \"inevitably unwieldy [...] but thrilling all the same, and followed by a delicate coda. So many stories. So many adventures. So much to sort out before the next cycle starts.\"[199]\n\nRichard Brody was more critical of the film in The New Yorker, saying that its good acting was not matched by comparable skill from its directors: \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\".[200] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker gave the film a negative review, finding it overdeveloped and overwrought: \"The one thing you do need to know about Avengers: Endgame is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing.\"[201]\n\nAt the 92nd Academy Awards, Avengers: Endgame received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[202] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award (which it won),[203] a British Academy Film Award,[204] and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two).[205] Its Wikipedia page was the most-viewed article of 2019, with 44.2 million views.[206] Endgame ranked 41st in a March 2020 Empire magazine poll of the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[207] The Avengers' assembling moment was one of five finalists for an Oscars Cheer Moment in the \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest for the 94th Academy Awards in February 2022, despite the film's ineligibility for other Academy Awards that year.[208]\n\nIn May 2018, the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said about Marvel's plans beyond Endgame: \"I'm guessing we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond Avengers, but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't see more Avengers down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that.\" Iger added that audiences should not assume that there would not be another Avengers film, due to the popularity of the characters and the franchise.[209] Shortly after the film's premiere, the Russo brothers said that they were not opposed to returning to the MCU in the future due to their positive relationship with Marvel Studios, but did not plan to do so at that time.[210] In January 2021, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said that another Avengers film would be produced \"at some point\".[211]\n\nAt the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige announced Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars, scheduled to be released on May 2, 2025, and November 7, 2025, respectively. The films would conclude Phase Six of the MCU.[212] Feige later said that the Russo brothers would not return to direct the films.[213] Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021), was confirmed as director of The Kang Dynasty shortly afterwards.[214] In September, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) writer Jeff Loveness was announced as writing the screenplay.[215] The next month, Loki season one (2021) head writer and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) writer Michael Waldron was hired to write the screenplay for Avengers: Secret Wars.[216] Shortly afterwards, Secret Wars's release date was pushed back to May 1, 2026.[217] In June 2023, Disney delayed The Kang Dynasty to May 1, 2026, and Secret Wars to May 7, 2027.[218] Cretton had stepped down as director of The Kang Dynasty by November 2023,[219] when Waldron was hired to replace Loveness as the writer for The Kang Dynasty.[220] Jonathan Majors, who portrayed Kang the Conqueror and was expected to appear in both films, was fired by Disney and Marvel Studios in December 2023 after he was convicted of assault. By then, Marvel was referring to The Kang Dynasty internally as Avengers 5.[221]\n\nAt the 2024 San Diego Comic-Con, the Russo brothers were announced to be directing the next two Avengers films. They revealed that Avengers 5 was now titled Avengers: Doomsday and would feature Doctor Doom as the main antagonist rather than Kang. Downey was revealed to have been cast as Doom for both films, and McFeely had taken over as writer for the films from Waldron.[222]\n"

        "content": "\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and the 23rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts, written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Zendaya, Cobie Smulders, Jon Favreau, J. B. Smoove, Jacob Batalon, Martin Starr, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei, and Jake Gyllenhaal. In the film, Parker is recruited by Nick Fury (Jackson) and Mysterio (Gyllenhaal) to face the Elementals while he is on a school trip to Europe.\n\nDiscussions for a sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming began by October 2016, and the project was confirmed later that year. Holland, Watts, and the writers were all set to return by the end of 2017. In 2018, Jackson and Gyllenhaal joined the cast as Fury and Mysterio, respectively. Holland revealed the sequel's title ahead of filming, which began that July and took place in England, the Czech Republic, Italy, and the New York metropolitan area. Production wrapped in October 2018. The marketing campaign is one of the most expensive for a film ever and attempted to avoid revealing spoilers for Avengers: Endgame prior to its April 2019 release.\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 26, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 2, as the final film in Phase Three of the MCU. The film received positive reviews with praise for its humor, action sequences, visuals, and the performances of Holland and Gyllenhaal. It grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the first Spider-Man film to pass the billion-dollar mark, the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2019, and became Sony Pictures' highest-grossing film and the 24th-highest-grossing film of all time. A sequel, Spider-Man: No Way Home, was released in December 2021.\n\nIn Ixtenco, Mexico, Nick Fury and Maria Hill investigate an unnatural storm and encounter the Earth Elemental. Quentin Beck, a super-powered individual, arrives and defeats the creature. He is subsequently recruited by Fury and Hill. In New York City, the Midtown School of Science and Technology completes its year, which was restarted to accommodate the students who previously disintegrated five years earlier as a result of Thanos's actions; they had reappeared un-aged, thanks to the actions of the Avengers.[a] The school organizes a two-week summer field trip to Europe, where Peter Parker—who is still mourning the death of his mentor Tony Stark—plans to reveal to classmate MJ his attraction to her. Happy Hogan informs Parker that Fury intends to contact him, but Parker ignores Fury's phone call.\n\nParker and his classmates travel to Venice, Italy, where the Water Elemental attacks. While Parker helps protect his classmates, Beck arrives and defeats the creature. Fury meets with Parker and gives him Stark's eyeglasses, which were meant for his successor. The glasses enable him to communicate with and take command of the artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H., which has access to Stark Industries' databases and commands a large orbital weapons supply. Beck claims to have entered from an alternate reality within the multiverse, where the four Elementals killed his family and destroyed his civilization. With only the Fire Elemental left to destroy, Beck predicts it will attack Prague, Czech Republic. Parker declines Fury's invitation to join the fight and returns to his class trip, but Fury secretly changes the class's itinerary to divert the students to Prague.\n\nParker is forced to help Beck fight the Fire Elemental to again protect his friends. Beck manages to destroy the creature with Parker's help. Fury and Hill invite Parker and Beck to Berlin to discuss the formation of a new superhero team, but Parker decides that Beck should go alone and transfers control of E.D.I.T.H. to him. Once Parker leaves, Beck celebrates alongside ex-Stark Industries employees, with whom he had been working to masquerade as a superhero. Beck, who was fired from his position as Stark's holographic-illusions specialist due to his unstable nature, is using advanced projectors to simulate his powers and the Elementals. He plans to use E.D.I.T.H.'s orbital weaponized drones to increase the scale of his illusions and fraudulently establish himself as an Avenger-level hero.\n\nAfter MJ tells Parker she knows he is Spider-Man, they discover that a piece of debris she retrieved during the battle with the Fire Elemental is a projector and the pair realize Beck's deception. Parker travels to Berlin, Germany, to warn Fury, but he is tricked by Beck with an elaborate illusion, revealing the names of his friends who know about Beck's plan before being hit by a train. Beck is unaware that Parker, though injured, has survived. In the Netherlands, Parker contacts Hogan, who flies him to London, England, where his classmates are. Beck uses E.D.I.T.H. to orchestrate a fusion of all the Elementals. He intends to kill Parker's friends during the staged attack, as Beck is concerned that they will expose him with their knowledge. Parker disrupts the illusions and an enraged Beck attacks him with drones. Parker regains control of E.D.I.T.H. and defeats Beck, who is hit by a misfired gunshot from one of the drones. Before he dies, Beck tells one of his associates to retrieve data from the drones. After returning to New York City, Parker begins a relationship with MJ.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, J. Jonah Jameson of TheDailyBugle.net broadcasts doctored footage of the London incident in which Beck frames Spider-Man for the drone attack and his death before exposing Spider-Man's secret identity to the world, much to Parker's shock. In a post-credits scene, Fury and Hill are revealed to be the Skrulls Talos and Soren in disguise, under orders from the real Fury while he is away in space commanding a group of Skrulls.\n\nAngourie Rice and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. reprise their roles from Homecoming as Parker's classmates Betty Brant, Ned's on-and-off girlfriend,[13][24] and Jason Ionello.[25] Peter Billingsley reprises his role from Iron Man (2008) as scientist William Ginter Riva, a former employee of Stark Industries who now works with Beck.[26] J. K. Simmons appears as J. Jonah Jameson in the mid-credits scene,[27] marking the first time an actor has reprised a non-MCU role in an MCU film after Simmons portrayed a different incarnation of Jameson in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film trilogy.[28] Ben Mendelsohn and Sharon Blynn make uncredited cameo appearances in the post-credits scene as the Skrulls Talos and Soren, reprising their roles from Captain Marvel (2019);[27] this scene reveals that they have been posing as Fury and Hill during the film.[29]\n\nAdditionally, Numan Acar portrays Fury's associate Dimitri,[30][31] while Remy Hii plays Brad Davis, a popular student whom Parker sees as competition for MJ's affection,[32][33] and Claire Rushbrook portrays Janice Lincoln, a woman working for Beck.[34] Zach Barack, the first openly transgender actor in an MCU film, portrays one of Parker's new classmates, Zach,[35][36][37] while Zoha Rahman also appears as a classmate of Parker's.[38] Dawn Michelle King, an assistant editor on many MCU films including Far From Home, provides the voice for the artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H.[39] Jeff Bridges and Robert Downey Jr. appear as Obadiah Stane and Stark through the use of archival footage from Iron Man and Captain America: Civil War (2016), respectively.[26][40] Images from previous MCU films of Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and Paul Bettany as Stark, Steve Rogers / Captain America, Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, and Vision, respectively, are used in the film's opening \"in memoriam\" segment.[41][42]\n\nIn June 2016, Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman stated that Sony and Marvel Studios were committed to making future Spider-Man films after Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).[43] The following month, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said if additional films were made, the company had an early idea to follow the model of the Harry Potter film series, and have the plot of each film cover a new school year,[44] with a second film intended to take place during Peter Parker / Spider-Man's junior year of high school.[45] By October, discussions had begun for a second film, including which villain would be featured, according to Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, who was signed for two more Spider-Man films after Homecoming.[46][47] In December, after the successful release of the first Homecoming trailer, Sony slated a sequel to the film for July 5, 2019.[48] Sony's insistence that the sequel be released in 2019 complicated Marvel's preference for secrecy regarding their plans for Spider-Man in this film and their other MCU films, since the character would die at the end of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and would not be resurrected before Avengers: Endgame in April 2019 by which time marketing for this film would have already begun.[49]\n\nAfter being able to include Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark / Iron Man for Homecoming, Sony was revealed in June 2017 to have the use of another Marvel Studios-controlled character for the sequel.[50] Feige stated that Marvel and Sony were \"just starting to solidify our plans\" for the film, and felt Spider-Man's appearances in Infinity War and Endgame would \"launch him off into a very new cinematic universe at that point\", similar to how Captain America: Civil War (2016) \"informed everything in Homecoming\".[51] Marvel and Sony both wanted Homecoming director Jon Watts returning for the sequel, with Feige saying \"that's the intention for sure\", and Watts said he was signed for another Spider-Man film.[52] Feige said the sequel would have a subtitle like Homecoming, and would not feature \"2\" in the title. He added that filming was expected to begin in April or May 2018.[53] As with Homecoming, Feige said the film's villain would be one that had not yet been seen in film.[54] By July, Watts was in negotiations with the studios regarding his return for the sequel,[4] and Marisa Tomei expressed interest in returning as Aunt May from the previous films.[55] That same month, Watts expressed interest in including Morbius, Blade, or the Chameleon in the sequel.[56]\n\nThe film is set eight months after the conclusion of Endgame.[57] Watts felt dealing with many of the unanswered questions from Endgame posed \"a fun creative challenge\" for the Far From Home team. They looked to \"make a movie that's in that world and deals with those stories but is also still [a] fun Spider-Man movie\". For example, Ned, MJ, and Flash all turned to dust during the events of Infinity War along with Parker, while some of his classmates did not and are now five years older due to the events of Endgame. Watts compared this dynamic to the film Flight of the Navigator (1986), calling the situation \"really weird ... but ... also something you can have a lot of fun with\".[7]\n\nAt the end of August 2017, as the film was entering pre-production,[53] Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers were in final negotiations to return from Homecoming to write the sequel.[58] In early October, Jacob Batalon confirmed he would reprise his role of Ned Leeds in the sequel.[15][9] Feige confirmed that Watts was returning to direct the sequel in December.[59] By February 2018, Zendaya was slated to return for the film, reprising her role as Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson.[60][9] Location scouting for the film began at the end of the month, as did the pre-visualisation process for the creative team to begin planning action sequences and visual effects for the film.[61] By late April, Feige stated that filming was scheduled to begin in early July 2018, and would primarily occur in London. This was a change from the first film, which was mostly produced in Atlanta. Feige explained that one of the reasons behind this change in location was because a majority of the sequel would be spent around the world, outside New York City.[62]\n\nA month later, Jake Gyllenhaal entered negotiations to play Quentin Beck / Mysterio, while Tomei and Michael Keaton were confirmed to reprise their respective roles of May and Adrian Toomes / Vulture; Gyllenhaal's casting was confirmed a month later,[63] but Watts later stated that Keaton and Laura Harrier, who played Toomes' daughter Liz in Homecoming, would not be appearing in the sequel.[12] Also in May, McKenna and Sommers were also confirmed as the film's screenwriters.[19][64] They began working on the film from a set of notes that Marvel had put together based on different influences and story ideas. This included the directive that the film would be releasing shortly after Endgame and would need to deal with the death of Stark due to the relationship between that character and Spider-Man that previous films had established. The film also needed to deal with the aftereffects of \"the Blip\", the five-year period between Infinity War and Endgame where half of all life disappeared. Mysterio was chosen to be the film's villain because he is one of Spider-Man's iconic villains that had yet to be featured in a film, and because his history of deception in the comics lent itself to a character who could take advantage of a Spider-Man that is mourning the death of Stark. This also allowed the writers to explore relevant modern themes such as fake news. Mysterio's plan went through several iterations, including an early suggestion that he could be an alien Skrull in disguise.[65]\n\nThe film reuses two of Spider-Man's costumes from the previous films: his main costume from Civil War and Homecoming, and the Iron Spider suit from Infinity War and Endgame. It also introduces two new costumes: a black \"stealth\" costume given to Parker by Nick Fury, and a new, upgraded Spider-Man suit that Parker designs for himself at the end of the film.[66] Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding explained that Watts had wanted to include a suit inspired by the Spider-Man Noir version of the character, which led to the design of the more tactical stealth suit. He added that the suit represents Parker experimenting with being a new kind of superhero. Other tactical costumes from the comic books were looked at when developing this one, but Meinerding felt they looked less practical than the more straightforward Noir inspiration. The costume includes tactical goggles that can be flipped up. For Parker's new self-designed costume, Meinerding originally designed it with the idea that it would be made from Parker's webbing since that is the strongest material he has access to.[67] Practical versions of the costumes were created by Ironhead Studio, who previously worked on The Amazing Spider-Man films. For Far From Home, Ironhead developed a skull cap for the costumes that has built-in fans to prevent the goggles from steaming up. They also developed a magnetic bellows system for connecting the goggles to the mask, so they could be easily removed but not fall off during action sequences.[68]\n\nAt the end of June 2018, Holland revealed the film's title to be Spider-Man: Far From Home.[69] Feige explained that they decided to have Holland reveal the title because they thought it was likely that it would leak after filming began anyway.[70] He compared the title to Homecoming in that it is \"full of alternate meaning\" while continuing the use of \"Home\",[71] and revealed the film's premise to be Parker and his friends going to Europe on a summer field trip, away from their home of New York.[72] The creative team had discussions about featuring New Asgard as one of the destinations for Parker's field trip in the film.[73]\n\nPrincipal photography began on location in Hertfordshire, England, on July 2, 2018,[74] under the working title Fall of George.[75] Matthew J. Lloyd served as director of photography, after previously working with Watts on Cop Car (2015). Watts had wanted to work with Lloyd on Homecoming, but the cinematographer was working on Power Rangers (2017) at the time.[76] Filming moved to London,[62] with locations including East London,[77] and at London Stansted Airport.[78] Studio work occurred at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden near Watford, England, where a Venice set was created on one of the studio's backlots.[13][33] Shortly after filming began, set photos revealed Hemky Madera would return as bodega owner Mr. Delmar,[79] while J.B. Smoove and Numan Acar joined the cast.[80][30] By early August, Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders were confirmed to be appearing in the film, reprising their respective roles of Nick Fury and Maria Hill from previous MCU films,[6] and Remy Hii joined the cast later in the month.[32] Filming took place in Prague and Liberec in the Czech Republic in September,[81][82] and moved to Venice by the end of the month.[82] Filming moved to New York City and Newark, New Jersey in October, where it used the working title Bosco.[83][84] Locations included areas around Madison Square Garden and Penn Station,[84] and Newark Liberty International Airport.[78] An uncredited actor was originally cast as Flash Thompson's father for the airport scene, but Tony Revolori pitched to producer Chris Buongiorno about having Flash's butler Gerald show up at the airport instead as a \"funnier\" option, so the crew shot the scene twice, one version with the actor playing Flash's father and the other one with the butler respectively, with the latter being chosen.[85] Filming wrapped on October 16, 2018.[86]\n\nLloyd explained that the creative team had approached the film as a road-trip story, and so he wanted to maintain the distinct look and feel of each location visited. This meant giving each stop on the school trip a distinct lighting scheme and color palette. For example, Lloyd visited Venice three times during location scouting to discuss how the scenes there would be filmed, and learned that the city has a \"bright, pastel feel, where the light comes through and hits a building. It bathes people in this warm, sandy light\". Prague, on other hand, has a \"more warm and cool mix, and the beauty of that sort of Baroque, eastern-European architecture.\" The production took advantage of lighting already on the buildings in Prague, which are often lit for texture in real life. Lloyd felt comfortable working within the aesthetic of the MCU after acting as director of photography on the first season of the Marvel Television series Daredevil (2015–2018) and the miniseries The Defenders (2017), as well as working on additional photography for the films Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and Captain Marvel (2019).[76] Lloyd originally began planning to use the Alexa 65 cameras that Marvel usually films with, but Sony asked that they focus on optimizing the footage for their 2K releases, so the production switched to Alexa Mini cameras. This ended up being a lot easier for the camera department to use on location, and for combining live-action shooting with visual effects elements.[61]\n\nIn late October 2018, Sony Pictures reached a new multi-film agreement with IMAX Corporation to release their films in IMAX, including Far From Home.[87] At Sony's CCXP Brazil panel in December 2018, it was revealed that the Elementals—a group of characters based on the elements of water, earth, air, and fire—would appear in the film.[88] The four Elementals are modeled after different Spider-Man villains from Marvel comic books: the water Elemental borrows from Hydro-Man, the fire Elemental borrows from Molten Man, the Earth Elemental borrows from Sandman, and the air Elemental borrows from Cyclone.[89][90][91][92] The names of these other villains are not given to the characters in the film,[13][33] albeit Hydro-Man's public identity as Morris Bench is mentioned at one point.[93] In addition to these characters, there were also discussions about using the villain Swarm as a model for a potential fifth Elemental in the film.[94] Martin Starr was confirmed to be reprising his role as Roger Harrington from Homecoming the next month.[95][17] Following up Revolori's pitch for Flash's family life, the filmmakers added during the E.D.I.T.H. scene the text of Flash texting his parents.[85] In April 2019, Sony moved the film's release date up to July 2, 2019.[96] While promoting Endgame at a fan event in Shanghai, Feige said Far From Home would be the final film of the MCU's Phase Three, rather than the start of Phase Four as some had believed.[97] Also in April, Jackson returned to do reshoots for the film.[98]\n\nDiscussing the film's mid-credits scene, Watts explained that they approached J.K. Simmons \"as late as possible\" before the film's release to ask him to reprise his role as J. Jonah Jameson from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film trilogy, hoping to keep the cameo a surprise for fans.[99] Watts acknowledged that there was a chance Simmons would not want to reprise the role, but stated that he never considered another actor, saying, \"It's gotta be him. Like, if it wasn't him, it wasn't worth doing.\"[100] After being pitched the idea for the cameo, Simmons called Raimi and received the director's blessing to return to the role for the new film.[101] The MCU version of the character is brand new, not the Raimi version \"from another dimension or multiverse\".[102] Simmons' footage was filmed in a Disney conference room in front of a green screen.[99] Watts noted that Simmons' performance was over-the-top in Raimi's films, but now that same performance has real-world comparisons,[100] such as Alex Jones. According to Feige, the changes in the real world also meant that moving the character from a newspaper editor to a \"radical right news journalist that kind of scream[s] in front of the camera\" made more sense.[102] Simmons said he and Watts did not see \"eye to eye\" on the film's contemporary portrayal of the character versus his performance in Raimi's films.[103]\n\nWatts described Far From Home as a \"con man movie\" with \"so many layers of deception\", and for the post-credits scene he felt that ending the film with \"one last twist\" was on theme. He felt that he owed the fans a more substantial post-credits scene than the jokey one at the end of Homecoming. The Far From Home scene depicts Fury on vacation, in a simulation, both of which are also themes in the film, and reveals that the Fury and Hill seen throughout the film are actually the Skrulls Talos and Soren in disguise, with Ben Mendelsohn and Sharon Blynn reprising their roles from Captain Marvel, respectively.[27] Watts felt this twist made sense after Fury's interactions with the Skrulls in Captain Marvel.[100] Footage of Jackson and Smulders originally intended for the film's opening scene was used in the reveal. Smulders learned about the twist from Feige shortly before the film's release.[29] Post-production for Far From Home was completed in June 2019.[104]\n\nThe film's visual effects were provided by Framestore, Industrial Light & Magic, Image Engine, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Luma Pictures, Rising Sun Pictures, Scanline VFX, Territory Studio, and Method Studios.[105] Janek Sirrs served as visual effects supervisor on the film, and explained that following the release of the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) the effects team looked for ways to use similarly inventive visuals in Far From Home. They ultimately did not use added effects to represent Spider-Man's Spider-sense because these did not fit within the live-action world or were too similar to previous effects, such as Daredevil's sonar vision. They did try to use Spider-Man's actions and the use of his abilities to show his growth since Homecoming, but to also show his \"reach as always exceeding his grasp as he refines his superhero skills\".[106] The film's main-on-end title sequence was designed by Perception.[107]\n\nMethod Studios added Spider-Man to a Venice speedboat scene, using their Spider-Man suit asset from Homecoming.[108] Image Engine created the Stark jet, drone, and satellite. The jet work included the creation of a new Spider-Man suit,[108] for which the vendor had to design the interior of the suit based on a scan of a practical costume they were given. They also made a Netherlands tulip field for a scene that was filmed in a grass field in the UK. It required around two million digital tulips.[109] Rising Sun Pictures created the holograms used by Mysterio when he first explains the Elementals to Spider-Man, which include simulations of black-holes and elements researched from real-world history and mythology. The company aimed for the holograms to have a similar quality to the ones that they had created for Captain Marvel.[108] Mysterio was designed by Ryan Meinerding, Marvel Studios' head of visual development, to look like a combination of different Marvel heroes such as Thor and Doctor Strange. His fishbowl helmet is retained from the comics. Sirrs described the character as a \"larger-than-life showman at heart\" and almost a superhero version of Liberace.[106] The digital model for Mysterio was created by Scanline.[110]\n\nThe Elementals consisted of animated figures, often driven by slowed-down motion-capture performances, with environmental effects layered on top. Scanline created Earth and Water, Luma created Fire, and Imageworks created the final amalgamation of the four creatures,[106] referred to as the Super Uber Elemental (SUE).[110] For the Fire Elemental, Luma created different looks and actions for the character to show Watts and Sirrs potential designs and movements for the character. This included a progression where the creature goes from being upright and humanoid to bigger and more hunched over as it consumes metal throughout the sequence. Watts responded positively to movements that looked more creature-like.[111] The final battle was created by Imageworks, and consists of over 300 visual effects shots. In addition to creating the SUE—which required extensive effect simulations for the different combined elements such as \"water tentacles\", rocks, lava, and lightning—the company had to create a digital model of the Tower Bridge for the fight to take place around. The company attempted to fully render only small sections of the bridge where needed, but ultimately required around 80% of the bridge to be fully detailed due to how much of it is seen throughout the fight. They made use of Image Engine's Stark jet model and Scanline's Mysterio asset for the fight, and created the drone models and new Spider-Man suit that were used by the other vendors. They started with a single drone design that featured missiles, cannons, and Gatling guns, but this became repetitive during the battle and so flamethrower and sonic blaster drones were added. Additionally, the sky and environment needed to be digitally replaced in most of the sequence.[110]\n\nFramestore handled the \"Illusion Battle\" sequence in which Mysterio traps Spider-Man within a series of elaborate fear-based illusions. Based on early prototypes of the sequence from Framestore, Marvel decided to extend it to around 150 shots. It was heavily pre-visualized to define which background plates and motion-capture performances would be required; Framestore visual effects supervisor Alexis Wajsbrot compared the motion-capture process for the sequence to automated dialogue replacement, where each short section of the performance was captured individually. The company used existing digital assets from other vendors, including for the different Spider-Man suits, combined with new models such as those for statues of fallen heroes or a \"Zombie Iron Man\".[112][108] The effect of green smoke that is throughout the sequence was created using Houdini. Framestore took inspiration from the title sequences of the James Bond films, especially that of Spectre (2015) for the graveyard portion of the battle.[112] For the transition between the real world and the illusions, Framestore had to match a similar transition from the B.A.R.F. scene in Civil War which Wajsbrot described as a time-consuming process for each environment in which it was required.[112][108] Sirrs compared the sequence to an elaborate Broadway production with an unlimited budget, and named several other visual influences including the Looney Tunes short Duck Amuck (1953), Paprika (2006), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), and the \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" scene from Dumbo (1941).[106]\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming composer Michael Giacchino was confirmed to return to score Far From Home in October 2018.[113][114] Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" plays during the Marvel Studios opening logo as part of the film's opening \"in memoriam\" scene.[115] The end credits song is \"Vacation\" by The Go-Go's.[116] The soundtrack album was released by Sony Classical on June 28, 2019.[117]\n\nDue to Parker dying at the end of Infinity War and not being resurrected until Endgame,[118][119][49] Germain Lussier of io9 noted in May 2018 that Sony would either have to begin marketing this film only two months before its release or spoil the fact that Parker is resurrected for general audiences that may not realize that this would happen in Endgame. Lussier suggested the latter approach be taken, while a representative of Sony said the studio would be working with Marvel to \"figure out the Spider-Man strategy\".[118] Holland and Gyllenhaal debuted the first trailer for Far From Home at Sony's CCXP Brazil panel on December 8, 2018. The footage does not acknowledge the events of Infinity War or Endgame, with Steven Weintraub of Collider describing it as a continuation of \"the Spider-Man universe\" only.[120] Holland debuted the trailer publicly on his Instagram account on January 15, 2019.[121] A slightly different \"international version\" was also released.[122] Several news outlets commented on Parker's appearance in the trailer following the events of Infinity War,[122][123][124] with Zack Straf of IndieWire pointing out that while the trailer reveals Parker's return, it does not explain how.[123]\n\nAdam Chitwood of Collider described the trailer as \"cute and fun\" just like Homecoming, and approved of the vacation storyline, the addition of Fury, and Mysterio's short appearance. He did think the film looked \"the tiniest bit less special\" when compared to the acclaimed animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.[95] A teaser poster was released with the trailer showing Spider-Man's mask covered in travel stickers. Chitwood said the poster was \"really fun, leaning into the whole 'summer vacation' vibe\" while potentially hinting at the film's locations with the stickers.[125] Graeme McMillian of The Hollywood Reporter felt the trailer presented the threat of the Elementals so audiences would be \"thrown off the scent\" of Mysterio being the villain.[126] McMillian's colleague Richard Newby felt the \"main takeaway from the trailer is that Spider-Man: Far From Home is deftly blending old and new school elements of the Spider-Man mythos, for a result that feels surprisingly fresh\". Newby was also excited about the inclusion of Fury.[127] Forbes's Scott Mendelson felt the trailer showed \"the sheer confidence\" of Sony in its Spider-Man films, especially after the successes of Homecoming, Venom (2018), and Into the Spider-Verse.[128] The trailer received 130 million views in 24 hours, surpassing Homecoming (116 million views) as the most viewed Sony Pictures trailer in that time period.[129]\n\nOn May 6, 2019, a second trailer for the film was released. The trailer featured an introduction from Holland warning viewers that it includes spoilers for Avengers: Endgame.[7] Watts, who knew the plots of Infinity War and Endgame and worked with the Russo brothers on Spider-Man's appearances in those films, was relieved that the trailer's release allowed him to speak more openly about Far From Home.[7] The second trailer was viewed 135 million times in 24 hours, surpassing the first Far From Home trailer as the most viewed Sony Pictures trailer in that time period.[130] Beginning the weekend after the trailer's release, screenings of Endgame began with a message from Holland telling audiences to stay till the end of the credits, with the trailer played at the end of the film. Marvel previously added a trailer for The Avengers (2012) to the end of Captain America: The First Avenger (2011).[131] United Airlines served as a promotional partner on the film, with one of their Boeing 777 aircraft and several United employees appearing in the film.[78] As done with previous MCU films, Audi also sponsored the film, promoting several vehicles such as the e-tron SUV, while having some of their other vehicles appear in the film.[132] Partnering with several other companies, including Dr Pepper, Papa John's Pizza, and Burger King, the film had a total promotional marketing value of $288 million, the largest for a film ever.[133]\n\nAhead of the film's home media release, in September 2019, Sony released a \"Night Monkey\" trailer, featuring footage from the film of Spider-Man in his jokey alter-ego of the same name. Lussier said the trailer was clever, and \"in terms of repurposing old footage in fun, funny new ways, you have to give Sony a tip of the cap for this.\"[134] Later in the month, Sony created a real version of the fictional TheDailyBugle.net website as part of a viral marketing campaign to promote the home media release of the film. Inspired by real-world \"conspiracy-pushing\" websites such as that of Alex Jones, the website features Simmons reprising his role as Jameson in a video where he speaks out against Spider-Man and in support of Mysterio, before adding \"Thanks for watching. Don't forget to like and subscribe!\"[135][136] The website includes testimonials from supposed victims of \"the Blip\", including one complaining that they disappeared in a dangerous situation and were seriously injured when they reappeared. This contradicts a statement by Feige saying that anyone in such a situation would have reappeared safely.[137] Several days after this was pointed out, the website was updated to say this story was faked for an insurance claim.[138]\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home had its world premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 26, 2019.[139] The film was released on June 28, in China and Japan,[140] and in the United States on July 2,[96] in 3D and IMAX.[87] In the United States, it opened in 4,634 theaters, which was second all-time behind Avengers: Endgame.[141] It was originally scheduled to be released on July 5.[69] The film was re-released on Labor Day weekend, beginning August 29, with four minutes of extra footage.[142] Spider-Man: Far From Home was the last film released in Phase Three of the MCU.[97]\n\nIn March 2024, Sony announced that all of their live-action Spider-Man films would be re-released in theaters as part of Columbia Pictures' 100th anniversary celebration. Spider-Man: Far From Home was re-released on May 27, 2024.[143]\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on digital on September 17, 2019, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on October 1.[144] The home media release features a short film titled Peter's To-Do List, which uses scenes of Parker retrieving various items for his trip that were cut from the theatrical release of the film.[145] The short also includes footage featuring Hemky Madera reprising his Homecoming role as Mr. Delmar, the owner of a local bodega, which was all cut from Far From Home.[79][145]\n\nIn April 2021, Sony signed a deal with Disney giving them access to their legacy content, including past Spider-Man films and Marvel content in Sony's Spider-Man Universe, to stream on Disney+ and Hulu and appear on Disney's linear television networks. Disney's access to Sony's titles would come following their availability on Netflix. Far From Home had previously been available on Starz and FX.[146][147] The film became available on Disney+ in the United States on November 3, 2023.[148]\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home grossed $391.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $741.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.132 billion.[3] It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2019[149] and the 24th-highest-grossing film of all time.[150] On August 18, 2019, the film surpassed Skyfall (2012) to become Sony Pictures' highest-grossing film worldwide.[151][152] Far From Home was the first Spider-Man film to gross over $1 billion.[153] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $339 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participation, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it seventh on their list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[154]\n\nThree weeks before its domestic release, official industry tracking had the film grossing around $170 million over its six-day opening frame. Some had the film reaching as high as $200 million, while others were at a conservative $165 million; Sony was predicting a $154 million debut.[155][156] By the week of release industry estimates lowered to $140 million, with the studio expecting $120 million, due to the recent underperformance of other sequels.[157] Far From Home made a Tuesday-opening record $39.3 million, including an estimated $2.8–3 million from midnight previews at about 1,000 theaters.[141] It then made $27 million on its second day, the best-ever Wednesday gross for an MCU film, and $25.1 million on the 4th of July, the second highest ever total for the holiday behind Transformers ($29 million in 2007).[158] In its opening weekend the film made $92.6 million,[159] and a total of $185.1 million over the six-day frame, topping the $180 million made by Spider-Man 2 over its six-day July 4 opening in 2004; it was the number one film for the weekend.[160] In its second weekend, the film made $45.3 million, again topping the box office with a 51% decrease from the first week; lower than Homecoming's 62% drop in its second box office weekend.[161] Far From Home grossed over $21 million in its third weekend but was dethroned by newcomer The Lion King.[162] It completed its box office run as the seventh highest-grossing film of 2019 in this region.[163]\n\nFar From Home was projected to gross around $350 million worldwide by the end of its first week of release, and about $500 million over its first 10 days.[164][157] In China and Japan, where it was released a week prior to its U.S. debut, the film was expected to gross around a combined $90 million in its opening weekend.[165] In China, where pre-sale tickets were less than Homecoming's, the film made $35.5 million on its first day, including $3.4 million from midnight previews (the fourth-best of all time for a superhero film in the country).[166] It ended up slightly over-performing, debuting at $111 million including $98 million in China, the fourth-best-ever superhero opening in the country.[167] Far From Home ended up grossing $580.1 million worldwide over its first 10 days of release, including $238 million from international territories in its opening weekend. In China, the film had a 10-day total of $167.4 million, and its other biggest debuts were in South Korea ($33.8 million), the United Kingdom ($17.8 million), Mexico ($13.9 million) and Australia ($11.9 million).[168]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 90%, with an average score of 7.4/10, based on 459 reviews. The website's critics' consensus reads, \"A breezily unpredictable blend of teen romance and superhero action, Spider-Man: Far From Home stylishly sets the stage for the next era of the MCU.\"[169] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100 based on reviews from 55 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[170] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale,[171] while those at PostTrak gave it a 76% \"definite recommend\".[141]\n\nOwen Gleiberman of Variety praised Holland's performance and wrote, \"By the end, this Spider-Man really does find his tingle, yet coming after Into the Spider-Verse, with its swirling psychedelic imagery and identity games and trap doors of perception, Spider-Man: Far From Home touches all the bases of a conventional Marvel movie. It doesn't take you out of this world. But it's good enough to summon the kick—or maybe just the illusion—of consequence.\"[172] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling it \"zesty, sweet and satisfying\" and praised the performances of the cast.[173] Bernard Boo of PopMatters praised the film, commenting, \"Spider-Man: Far From Home is technically the final film in Phase [Three] of the MCU, and it's hard to think of a better way to send off the most successful run of one of the highest grossing franchises in history.\"[174] Alonso Duralde of TheWrap said that the film feels like \"a charming teen road-trip comedy that occasionally turns into a superhero movie\", which he said was a compliment. He highlighted the cast, including the chemistry between Holland, Zendaya and Batalon, and said that Gyllenhaal \"nails his character's earnestness but also clearly enjoys a few moments that let him channel every exasperated-sigh, I-just-want-to-get-this-right male diva director he's ever known.\"[175]\n\nWriting for IndieWire, David Ehrlich gave the film a grade of \"C\" and, despite complimenting the cast, called the film an \"unadventurous bit of superhero housekeeping that only exists to clean up the mess that Avengers: Endgame left behind\". He criticized the character development of Spider-Man, feeling that he does not change throughout the film beyond becoming more confident. He described the action as \"plastic\", and felt that the film did not give enough attention to its teen elements. Ehrlich said it might be enough to satisfy fans but called it a \"failure when compared to the remarkable artistry of Into the Spider-Verse or the raw pathos of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2.\"[176] John Anderson of The Wall Street Journal praised Holland and Zendaya's performances, but described the film as \"a visually incoherent, effects-heavy superhero movie\", and called the dialogue \"dire\".[177]\n\nIn September 2019, Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures announced that they were set to produce a third film, after an impasse between the two companies during negotiations.[199] Watts returned to direct,[200] from a script by McKenna and Sommers.[201] Holland, Zendaya, Favreau, Tomei, Batalon,[202] and Revolori reprise their roles,[200] while Benedict Cumberbatch and Benedict Wong reprise their MCU roles as Doctor Strange and Wong.[203][202] Spider-Man: No Way Home features several actors reprising their roles from past Spider-Man films, including Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as their versions of Spider-Man from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (2002–2007) and Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films (2012–2014), nicknamed \"Peter-Two\" and \"Peter-Three\" respectively,[204] alongside Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus, and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko / Sandman from the Raimi trilogy, as well as Rhys Ifans as Curt Connors / Lizard and Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon / Electro from the Webb films.[205] The film was released on December 17, 2021.[206]\n"

        "content": "\n\nBlack Widow is a 2021 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 24th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Cate Shortland from a screenplay by Eric Pearson and stars Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow alongside Florence Pugh, David Harbour, O-T Fagbenle, Olga Kurylenko, William Hurt, Ray Winstone, and Rachel Weisz. Set after the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past as a Russian spy before she became an Avenger.\n\nLionsgate Films began developing a Black Widow film in April 2004, with David Hayter attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the character's film rights had reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with Iron Man 2 (2010), and began discussing a solo film with Marvel. Work began in late 2017 and Shortland was hired in July 2018. Jac Schaeffer and Ned Benson contributed to the script before Pearson joined. The film was written to be a prequel that expands on Romanoff's history and helps end her MCU story following the character's death in Avengers: Endgame (2019). Shortland put an emphasis on the fight sequences and said this was the most violent MCU film so far. Filming took place from May to October 2019 in Norway, England, Budapest, Morocco, and Macon, Georgia.\n\nBlack Widow premiered at events around the world on June 29, 2021, and was released in the United States on July 9, simultaneously in theaters and through Disney+ with Premier Access. It is the first film in Phase Four of the MCU, and was delayed three times from an original May 2020 release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Black Widow broke several pandemic box office records and grossed over $379 million worldwide.[a] The film received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for the action sequences and for the performances of Johansson and Pugh. In July 2021, Johansson filed a lawsuit against Disney over the simultaneous release, which was settled two months later.\n\nIn 1995, super soldier Alexei Shostakov and Black Widow assassin Melina Vostokoff work as Russian undercover agents, posing as a family in Ohio with Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova as their daughters. They steal S.H.I.E.L.D. intel and escape to Cuba where their boss, General Dreykov, has Romanoff and Belova taken to the Red Room for training as Widows. In the following decades, Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia while Romanoff and Belova become successful, dangerous assassins. Romanoff eventually defects to S.H.I.E.L.D. after helping Clint Barton bomb Dreykov's Budapest office, which apparently kills Dreykov and his young daughter Antonia.\n\nIn 2016, Romanoff is a fugitive for violating the Sokovia Accords.[b] She escapes from U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross and flees to a safehouse in Norway supplied by Rick Mason. Meanwhile, Belova kills a rogue former Widow but comes in contact with a synthetic gas that neutralizes the Red Room's chemical mind-control agent. Belova sends antidote vials to Romanoff, hoping she and the Avengers can free the other Widows, and goes into hiding. When Romanoff is unknowingly driving with the vials in her car, Red Room agent Taskmaster attacks her. Romanoff escapes from Taskmaster and realizes that the vials came from Budapest. There she finds Belova, who reveals that Dreykov is alive and the Red Room is still active. Widows and Taskmaster attack them, but Romanoff and Belova evade them and meet with Mason, who supplies them with a helicopter.\n\nRomanoff and Belova break Shostakov out of prison to learn Dreykov's location, and he directs them to Vostokoff, who lives on a farm outside Saint Petersburg. There she is refining the chemical mind control process used on the Widows. Vostokoff alerts Dreykov and his agents arrive to take them, but Romanoff convinces Vostokoff to help them and the pair use face mask technology to switch places. At the Red Room, a secret aerial facility, Vostokoff frees Shostakov and Belova from their restraints. Dreykov sees through Romanoff's disguise. He reveals that Taskmaster is Antonia, who suffered damage in the Budapest bombing that was so severe Dreykov had to put technology in her head to save her. This turned Antonia into the perfect soldier, capable of mimicking the actions of anyone she sees. Romanoff is unable to attack Dreykov due to a pheromone lock installed in every Widow, but negates that by breaking her own nose and severing her olfactory nerve. Shostakov battles Taskmaster while Vostokoff takes out one of the facility's engines, and they then lock Taskmaster in a cell.\n\nDreykov escapes as other Widows attack Romanoff, but Belova exposes them to the antidote. Romanoff copies the locations of other Widows worldwide from Dreykov's computer as the facility begins to explode and fall. She retrieves two surviving antidote vials and frees Taskmaster from the locked cell. Vostokoff and Shostakov escape via a plane while Belova takes out Dreykov's aircraft, killing him. In freefall, Romanoff gives Belova a parachute before battling Taskmaster. After landing, Romanoff uses one antidote vial on Taskmaster and gives the other to Belova along with the locations of the other mind-controlled Widows so she can find and free them. Belova, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff and leave with Antonia and the freed Widows. Two weeks later, Mason supplies Romanoff with a Quinjet to use in freeing the imprisoned Avengers.\n\nIn a post-credits scene set after Romanoff's death,[c] Valentina Allegra de Fontaine visits Belova at Romanoff's grave. De Fontaine blames Romanoff's death on Barton and assigns him as Belova's next target.\n\nAdditionally, Liani Samuel, Michelle Lee, and Nanna Blondell appear as Red Room assassins Lerato, Oksana, and Ingrid, respectively,[46][57] while Jade Xu portrays another Black Widow who was later identified as Helen in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021).[58] Olivier Richters portrays Ursa Major, a fellow inmate of Shostakov's.[42][59] The film's post-credits scene sees Julia Louis-Dreyfus reprising her role as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine from the Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021) in an uncredited cameo appearance.[60] Jeremy Renner reprises his MCU role as Clint Barton in an uncredited voice-only cameo.[42]\n\n\"What I tried to do was use the backdrop of the splintered Soviet Empire—a lawless insane asylum with 400-some odd nuclear missile silos. It was all about loose nukes, and I felt it was very timely and very cool. Unfortunately, as I was coming up on the final draft, a number of female vigilante movies came out. We had Tomb Raider and Kill Bill, which were the ones that worked, but then we had BloodRayne and Ultraviolet and Æon Flux. Æon Flux didn't open well, and three days after it opened, the studio said, 'We don't think it's time to do this movie.'\"\n\nIn February 2004, Lionsgate acquired the film rights for the Marvel Comics character Black Widow,[62] and in April announced David Hayter as writer and director of the film, with Marvel Studios' Avi Arad producing.[63] By June 2006, Lionsgate had dropped the project and the rights reverted to Marvel Studios. Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter did not feel that they found another place \"that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously\". Hayter said this left him heartbroken, and he hoped the film would be made some day.[64]\n\nMarvel Studios entered early talks with Emily Blunt to play Black Widow in Iron Man 2 (2010) in January 2009,[65] but she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in Gulliver's Travels (2010).[66] In March 2009, Scarlett Johansson signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.[67] In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of Iron Man 2, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel's focus was on The Avengers (2012).[68] Johansson reprised her role in that film,[69] as well as in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014),[70] Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015),[71] Captain America: Civil War (2016),[72] Avengers: Infinity War (2018),[73] and Avengers: Endgame (2019).[74] After the release of Age of Ultron, Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the \"demand of the character\", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience's positive response to the character and Johansson's performance.[75]\n\nAfter teasing Black Widow's past in Age of Ultron, Feige said in February 2014 that he would like to see it explored further in a solo film. Development work for this had already started,[76] including a \"pretty in depth\" treatment by Nicole Perlman who co-wrote Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy (2014).[77] The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film and said it would be driven by demand from the audience.[78] That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel,[79] while director Neil Marshall said a month later that he \"would love to do a Black Widow film\". Marshall said he was fascinated by a superhero with \"extraordinary skills\" rather than superpowers who is also an ex-KGB assassin.[80] In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the character's different layers as depicted in her previous appearances. However, she felt that the character was being \"used well in this part of the universe\" at that time.[75] While promoting Civil War the next April, Feige noted that due to Marvel's announced schedule of films for Phase Three of the MCU, any potential Black Widow film would be four or five years away.[81] He added that Marvel was \"creatively and emotionally\" committed to making a Black Widow film eventually.[82]\n\nJoss Whedon, the director of The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron, said in July 2016 that he was open to directing a Black Widow film. He liked the idea of making it a paranoid spy thriller that was \"John le Carré on crack\".[83] In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, \"you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it.\" She cautioned that she may not want to wear a \"skin-tight catsuit\" for much longer.[84] The next February, Johansson said she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film \"amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone [film] and its own style and its own story.\"[85] Due to the development work already done and the public support for the project, Marvel Studios decided to move forward with the film at the beginning of the MCU's Phase Four in 2020 following the conclusion of the Infinity Saga storyline in Endgame.[20] Johansson said this decision had become \"more of a reality\" during the filming of Infinity War. Following Romanoff's death in Endgame, Johansson felt there was \"no pressing urgency\" to make a Black Widow film and this would improve the project's quality.[10]\n\nFeige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a Black Widow film in October 2017. Marvel then began meeting with writers for the project, including Jac Schaeffer and Jessica Gao.[86][87] Gao's pitch was influenced by Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), in which Romanoff would have been planted in a high school to assassinate a target and then 20 years later attends a high school reunion where she has to deal with the fallout of her earlier actions.[87] The pitch heavily featured the character She-Hulk, and Marvel Studios executive Brad Winderbaum felt Gao was instead pitching a She-Hulk film that featured Black Widow. Gao would later be hired as the head writer for the Marvel Studios television series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022).[88] Schaeffer met with Feige in December, and was hired to write the screenplay by the end of 2017.[89][90] Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.[91]\n\nMarvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.[92] By the end of April 2018, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an \"extremely thorough\" search,[93] including Deniz Gamze Ergüven, Chloé Zhao—who went on to direct Marvel's Eternals (2021)[94]—Amma Asante,[92] and Lynn Shelton.[95] Lucrecia Martel was also approached, but was discouraged when she was told that she would not have to \"worry about the action scenes\". She also felt the music and visual effects of Marvel films were \"horrible\".[96] In the following months, a shortlist of 49 directors was made before the top choices of Cate Shortland, Asante, and Maggie Betts met with Feige and Johansson in June.[97] Mélanie Laurent and Kimberly Peirce were also in the \"next-to-final mix\".[8][98] Johansson was a fan of Shortland's previous female-starring film Lore (2012),[8] and was the one who had approached her about directing the film;[24]: 1  Shortland was hired in July,[8] and watched all of Romanoff's MCU appearances in preparation for making the film.[99]\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the \"low-seven figure salary\" that she earned for starring in The Avengers. Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth each earned $15 million for the third films in their MCU franchises—Civil War and Thor: Ragnarok (2017), respectively—as well as for Infinity War and Endgame. Despite The Hollywood Reporter claiming that their report had been confirmed by \"multiple knowledgeable sources\", Marvel Studios disputed its accuracy and said they \"never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms\".[100] The Walt Disney Company later said Johansson had earned $20 million by the end of July 2021 for her work on the film,[101] including her role as an executive producer.[102]\n\nAs Romanoff dies during the events of Endgame, the film is set earlier in the MCU timeline.[10] It primarily takes place between the main plot of Civil War and that film's final scene, in which the Avengers escape from prison.[103] Johansson and Feige felt this was \"the best place to start\" because it is the first time that Romanoff is on her own and not tied to a larger organization such as the Red Room, S.H.I.E.L.D., or the Avengers.[10][104] This setting means the film is not an origin story for Romanoff, which Feige wanted to avoid because he felt that was the expected direction for a prequel to go.[25] He was influenced by the television series Better Call Saul (2015–2022), which is a prequel to the series Breaking Bad (2008–2013), calling it \"a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... because it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before\".[105]\n\nIn February 2019, Ned Benson was hired to rewrite the script,[106] and Feige confirmed that, despite rumors, the studio did not want the film to receive an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association.[107] The following month, Florence Pugh entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy,[108] later revealed to be Yelena Belova.[19] Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018, but began looking at other actresses in early 2019, including Saoirse Ronan[20][109] who passed on the role.[110] The studio returned to Pugh after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film Fighting with My Family (2019).[20] Devin Grayson and J. G. Jones, who co-created Belova, expected to receive $25,000 for her role in the film based on a 2007 agreement with Marvel Comics, but ultimately received $5,000 due to a provision in the contract which allowed Marvel to reduce creators' payments;[111] after Grayson went public with this, Marvel agreed to pay her the remaining amount.[112] In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside David Harbour,[27] Rachel Weisz,[34][113] and O-T Fagbenle.[34] An early version of the script included a scene from Civil War featuring Romanoff and Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark / Iron Man,[114] and Downey was reported to be appearing in the film.[115] Fans also expected Jeremy Renner to reprise his MCU role as Clint Barton.[116] Shortland and Feige ultimately decided against including other heroes so Romanoff could stand on her own,[116][117] though Renner does have an uncredited voice-only cameo.[42]\n\nEric Pearson, who started his writing career in Marvel's screenwriting program and went on to work on several MCU projects, was hired during pre-production to rewrite the film's script again.[13][118] He ultimately received sole screenwriter credit, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credits.[119] Shortland and Johansson had decided to take inspiration from the television series The Americans (2013–2018), which is about a Russian undercover spy family, by introducing Romanoff's own \"family\" of Russian spies including Belova.[13] When Pearson joined the film, the opening sequence—a prologue set in the 1990s with Romanoff and her \"family\" living undercover in the Midwestern United States—had already been written.[120] The rest of the film focuses on this family coming back together in the \"present day\", with a pivotal scene later in the film where they are all reunited around a dining table.[13] Of all the MCU projects that he had worked on, Pearson found Black Widow's setting within the MCU timeline to be the most difficult to get right. This was because he wanted the audience to feel that the villain could succeed without breaking the timeline, which would be difficult considering audiences had already seen Civil War, Infinity War, and Endgame. He chose to focus on the Red Room—where the Black Widows are trained—and its leader, who \"wields power from the shadows\". Pearson thought that the film's spy thriller tone helped alleviate his concerns about the villain.[120][121] A scene at the end of the film in which Thaddeus Ross pursues Romanoff was deliberately left unresolved, as Shortland wanted to leave the audience \"on a high\" and questioning how Romanoff escapes rather than exhausted with another fight.[122] This is then followed by a scene that connects this film to the end of Civil War by showing Romanoff leaving on a Quinjet to save the Avengers. She is wearing a vest given to her by Belova and has dyed her hair blonde, which matches the character's appearance in Infinity War.[118]\n\nPearson said there were discussions about ensuring the film was an appropriate farewell for Romanoff. He said they wanted it to feature \"the greatest hits\" of the character, including expanding on the backstory that was mentioned in The Avengers. In that film, Romanoff and Barton discuss a past mission in Budapest and there is also a mention of \"Dreykov's daughter\". Black Widow expands on the Budapest hints by having Romanoff return to Budapest and revealing some of the details of that mission. Dreykov is revealed to be the head of the Red Room, who Romanoff believes to have been killed during the earlier Budapest mission.[121] Johansson wanted the film to comment on the #MeToo movement which saw women supporting each other and \"coming through these shared experiences of trauma on the other side\",[123] and this is seen in the way that Romanoff is forced, by the arrival of Belova, to confront Dreykov and her past trauma. Johansson was grateful to have the film to comment on these ideas.[123] Pearson felt the truth behind \"Dreykov's daughter\" needed to be \"something pretty bad. Natasha is ashamed of it. We've been doing allusions to her having a dark past [throughout the MCU]... It had to be something actively tough that she did that haunts her dreams.\" He settled on the idea that Romanoff and Barton had used Dreykov's young daughter as bait to kill him and believed the girl had also died in the process. There were \"heated conversation\" with Marvel over how much of Romanoff's dark past to show in the film, and Pearson successfully argued for including this element. Earlier versions of the script had included the comic book character Tony Masters / Taskmaster as a villain. Pearson moved towards the more subtle villain Dreykov who he felt fit better into the story and the timeline, but decided to reveal that Dreykov's daughter is alive and now a version of Taskmaster that he compared to a Terminator. He felt this was a way to still have some \"Marvel fun\" within the otherwise grounded story.[121]\n\nPrincipal photography began on May 28, 2019, in Norway.[124] Shortland took inspiration from such films as How to Train Your Dragon (2010),[31]: 63  No Country for Old Men (2007), and Thelma & Louise (1991), as well as Captain America: The Winter Soldier. She looked at combat films and those with armies and militia, allowing her to imagine females in those roles to help translate that to Black Widow.[125] Shortland also referenced fight scenes involving female characters in Alien (1979) and the Terminator franchise, and wanted the film's fights to resemble \"real fights\" rather than wrestling matches.[99] She edited together fight scenes from different films into shorts that helped her explore the style of fighting that she wanted in the film. Shortland said this was the most violent film in the MCU and she wanted to approach that aspect with the same \"truth\" that she was approaching the rest of the film.[116]\n\nEarly reports suggested that Rob Hardy would be the film's cinematographer, but he left the production before filming began. Gabriel Beristain served as cinematographer instead,[126] having previously done so for the Marvel One-Shot short films Item 47 (2012) and Agent Carter (2013), for the television series Agent Carter (2015–2016),[24]: 3 [127] and for additional photography on Iron Man (2008) and six other MCU films.[128] Beristain was initially not credited in Black Widow's trailers, as pointed out by Jeff Sneider at Collider who wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting the cinematographer at that point. Sneider felt Beristain would be credited in later marketing materials,[126] and his hiring was confirmed in the film's official press advance.[24]: 3  Beristein later confirmed that he joined the film after production had already begun, opting to leave a television directing job and move to London so he could be the main cinematographer for an MCU film.[128] Shortland preferred to avoid technical equipment where possible and prioritize natural lighting, which provided a challenge for Beristain in having to match the light of the location shoots to later additional photography filmed in Los Angeles. The naturalistic approach was also reflected in interior scenes, lighting from outside the set or using lights with strong diffusion to create the same effect. An anamorphic format was chosen to highlight the expansive movements and landscapes in the film, with a special system used that split the camera's image sensor from its body to help with this approach.[129]\n\nThe production moved to Pinewood Studios in London in early June.[132] Shortland hired someone to help Johansson and Pugh bond through trust exercises and other bonding activities, but the pair felt their \"real bonding\" happened during Pugh's first two days of filming when they were working on an early fight scene between Romanoff and Belova. Pugh had some stunt experience from her work on Fighting with My Family, and Johansson gave her advice that she had received from Samuel L. Jackson while working on Iron Man 2. Pearson was on set to hear a joke from Pugh about the \"ridiculous\" pose that Johansson often lands in while fighting as Romanoff throughout her MCU appearances, which led to him adding some jokes from Belova to Romanoff about the poses in the script.[133] Ray Winstone joined the film's cast later in June,[49] when filming took place on location in Budapest.[134] 13 BMW X3s were used to create a car chase involving Romanoff and Belova in Budapest, with the crew often switching off the electronic stability control and safety assistance functions to be able to do what the script asked for. They also swapped the X3's electronic parking brake for a hydraulically actuated one. Second unit director Darrin Prescott explained that the crew would often \"replace the engine or tear the entire body off the car and rebuild it from scratch\". The sequence's plot and locations were adjusted to help Prescott create the \"spontaneous\" stunts that he wanted.[37]\n\nShooting took place in mid-July 2019 at Hankley Common in Surrey, England, under the working title Blue Bayou. The site was made to look like a Russian farmstead, with added helicopter crash sites. The Thursley Parish Council objected to this filming, as it had occurred while Marvel Studios' application to use the site was still pending. The production planned to revisit the site in late August for further filming.[130][131] Black Widow was officially announced at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con later in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.[19] In August, bodybuilder Olivier Richters revealed that he had been cast in the film,[135] playing a character that was subsequently confirmed to be Ursa Major.[42][59] That same month, crew undertook scanning and texture photography at the Well-Safe Guardian oil rig in the North Sea as a reference for visual effects.[136] A wrap party was held at the end of September, before production moved to Macon, Georgia, for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including Terminal Station, were dressed to portray Albany, New York.[137] Set photos from the start of October revealed that William Hurt would appear in the film, reprising his MCU role as Thaddeus Ross.[47] Additional filming in Georgia took place in Atlanta and Rome.[138] Also in early October, filming took place in Tangier, Morocco, with local production services provided by Zak Productions.[139][140] Principal photography lasted for 87 days[24]: 3  and officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.[141]\n\nMatthew Schmidt and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as editors on the film.[24]: 3  Pearson said the film's handling of Romanoff's Budapest backstory had been \"85% cracked\" prior to the start of filming, and the rest was determined during the editing process as well as additional photography.[121] Winstone disliked returning for the additional photography, feeling his performance was being criticized by Marvel Studios executives. He wanted his role to be recast instead, but was contractually obligated to return.[142] A scene of Romanoff wearing underwear and a T-shirt that Shortland enjoyed due to \"how sexy [Johansson] is [when] she's in control\" was cut from the film because test audiences criticized the scene as using the \"male gaze\".[99] Black Widow is one of the few Marvel films to feature an opening credits sequence, which Feige explained was because Shortland felt strongly about exploring what Dreykov is responsible for at the beginning of the film.[143][144] The sequence was designed by Perception, who worked with Shortland to film various vignettes on set that were made to look as if they were captured on 8 mm film, 90's digital video, and VHS. These were combined with old photographs and documents that Perception's team created and manipulated to tell the story.[145]\n\nIn mid-March 2020, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[146] In early April, Disney announced that Black Widow would be released on November 6, 2020, and the rest of their Phase Four slate of films were shifted to accommodate this.[147] In September 2020, Disney pushed the release back again to May 7, 2021,[148] followed by a third shift in March 2021 to July 9, 2021.[149] In April 2021, following Julia Louis-Dreyfus's appearance as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in the Marvel Studios television series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021), Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair reported that Louis-Dreyfus had been expected to first appear in Black Widow before the delays pushed its release to after The Falcon and the Winter Soldier's premiere on Disney+.[150] Feige later confirmed this, explaining that Black Widow's post-credits scene was originally intended to be the character's introduction but instead became a reference to her appearance in the series. He said this was the only change to Marvel's Phase Four plans that was forced by the pandemic.[151] The post-credits scene was added after Hawkeye (2021) showrunner Jonathan Igla expressed interest in having Yelena Belova appear in his series. Pearson was asked to write the scene, in which De Fontaine assigns Clint Barton as Belova's next target, without knowing who the target would be.[152] Shortland considered the setting of the scene, at Romanoff's grave in a remote clearing, to be a response to fans who were upset that Romanoff did not receive a funeral in Endgame. Shortland said the character was private and would not have wanted a large funeral, so this scene allowed the character's ending \"to be the grief the individuals felt, rather than a big public outpouring\".[25][153] Shortland said in May 2021 that the film had been completed a year prior and had not been altered, despite the release delays.[154] Olga Kurylenko's role as Antonia Dreykov / Taskmaster was revealed with the film's release.[38]\n\nThe film's visual effects vendors included Cinesite, Digital Domain, Industrial Light & Magic, Mammal Studios, SSVFX, Scanline VFX, Trixter, and Wētā FX.[155] Digital Domain was responsible for the final battle sequence and completed around 320 visual effects shots for the film. They created the Red Room, an airborne fortress hidden in the clouds, which was inspired by the brutalist architecture of the Soviet Union.[156][157] A combination of practical and visual effects were used to create the sequence where the Red Room is destroyed and falls from the sky: actors and stunt performers were filmed in a wind tunnel against bluescreens while being held with wires and mechanical arms, and the surrounding environment of sky and debris was created digitally.[156][157] Cinesite primarily handled the Russian prison that Harbour's Alexei Shostakov / Red Guardian is found in.[158] Wētā FX created the mountain range that surrounds the prison, based on photography from Svalbard, Norway, as well as an avalanche. Wētā also created the Mil Mi-8 helicopter that is seen in that sequence,[159] while Cinesite created it for other sequences.[158] For the pigs on the farm of Weisz's Melina Vostokoff, Wētā filmed live Kunekune pigs as reference for the digital pigs in the final shots.[159]\n\nIndustrial Light & Magic completed approximately 800 VFX shots for the film, working on the opening airplane escape scene, the Budapest apartment fight and subsequent motorcycle and car chase, and the fight between Romanoff and a group of Black Widows in Dreykov's office. The opening airplane scene was created with half of an airplane rig on a hydraulic platform. Footage filmed on location in Atlanta was played on LED screens on the soundstage to create interactive lighting for the actors on set. To create the Budapest scenes, ILM worked with second unit director Darren Prescott. Romanoff and Belova's chase across the rooftops was a combination of practical and visual effects, while scenes involving smokestacks were created using virtual actors. The car chase scene in Budapest features a practical tank driven by Taskmaster that was created by Paul Corbould, the film's special effects supervisor. Digital cars were added to the scene to make it appear more dangerous and for better interaction with the tank. For the fight scene in Dreykov's office, ILM worked on the graphic displays in the background as well as the lighting that interacts with the Widows' bodies.[160] In addition to creating the film's opening credits sequence, Perception designed the graphics for Dreykov's screens and other Red Room technology, researching Soviet Union technology for inspiration.[161] Trixter created Taskmaster's mask and worked on several action sequences as well.[158]\n\nAlexandre Desplat was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.[162] Late in post-production, Lorne Balfe replaced Desplat as composer, which Desplat confirmed in May 2020.[163][164] Balfe briefly references Alan Silvestri's motif for Romanoff and main theme for the Avengers from The Avengers in the score,[165][166] but otherwise wanted to focus on creating a new identity for Romanoff. His discussions with Shortland led to him writing an original piece in the style of Russian folk music that he thought Romanoff and Belova may have grown up listening to. The rest of his score developed from that piece, and also took inspiration from Russian composers Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky. Balfe completed recording for the score at Abbey Road Studios as the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact studio recording sessions.[165]\n\nThe film's opening credits sequence features a cover of Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" by Think Up Anger, featuring Malia J,[16] which was suggested by Perception.[145] \"American Pie\" by Don McLean and \"Cheap Thrills\" by Sia are also featured in the film.[167] A soundtrack album featuring Balfe's score was released digitally by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records on July 9, 2021.[168]\n\nThe film was officially announced at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con by Feige, Shortland, and members of the cast. They discussed the film and introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.[19] Some of that footage was included in a teaser trailer for the film that was released in December,[169][170] with several commentators highlighting its spy thriller tone[171][172] and calling the film \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans.[169][170][173] Rachel Leishman of The Mary Sue said finally seeing a trailer for the film was \"surprisingly emotional\". She felt that setting it between Civil War and Infinity War would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film after earlier MCU films had depicted her in a supporting role to the male Avengers.[173] Scott Mendelson of Forbes compared the trailer's story and tone to the films Atomic Blonde (2017), Red Sparrow (2018), and Anna (2019), but felt Black Widow had a commercial advantage over those films since it stars a familiar character. Mendelson thought this familiarity could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to Marvel Studios' Thor (2011).[172] The Hollywood Reporter's Richard Newby found noticeable differences in Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer compared to the styles of Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon, and the Russo brothers, all directors who helped define Black Widow in previous MCU films, indicating a move away from the MCU's \"house style\".[174]\n\nWhat was intended to be the final trailer for the film debuted in March 2020. Nicole Carpenter of Polygon said it was the most in-depth look at the film yet with a more \"intimate look\" at the relationship between Romanoff and Belova.[175] Josh Weiss of Syfy Wire enjoyed the trailer's quieter moments in addition to the expected action sequences.[176] Mendelson found the trailer to be an improvement over the teaser, attributing this to its theme of \"found families (the Avengers), forced families ([the Black Widows]) and actual family\" portrayed by Pugh, Harbour, and Weisz.[177]\n\nDisney's president of marketing Asad Ayaz said that after Black Widow was delayed from its original May 2020 release date, the marketing team paused their campaign for the film. Once they began working towards a new release date in 2021, they were able to use character looks and story points they had not revealed in the initial campaign to build a new approach to the film. Ayaz explained that they did not want it to feel like they had returned to the same marketing campaign, which focused on the Black Widow symbol and her traditional black costume. The marketing team differentiated the new campaign by instead featuring the character's new white costume from the film, and by focusing on her legacy as an Avenger.[178] The campaign featured 30 brands, including co-branded opportunities with GEICO, Ziploc, BMW, and Synchrony Bank. Additional custom partnerships occurred with Fandango, YouTube, Roku, TikTok, and Amazon, with a Twitter E3 gaming sponsorship as well as announcements, posters, and collectibles for premium theater experiences such as IMAX.[5]\n\nIn September 2020, Barbie released two Black Widow dolls featuring Romanoff's black and white outfits from the film.[179] Marvel released another trailer in April 2021, which Austen Goslin at Polygon described as a new \"final\" trailer for the film's new release date. He said it only had a few new scenes in it but provided the best look yet at the villain Taskmaster. Goslin highlighted the Russian-inspired version of The Avengers theme music used at the end of the trailer.[180] Germain Lussier of io9 also highlighted the use of The Avengers theme, feeling that the music combined with footage from previous MCU films as well as flashback moments of Romanoff and her family made the trailer feel more epic than the previous \"final\" trailer. Lussier said it was a trailer that \"gets you excited for the return\" of MCU films after the pandemic delays.[181] Ethan Anderton of /Film said the free-falling fight with Taskmaster showcased in the trailer \"looks like a sequence unlike any other\" in the MCU.[182] The trailer received over 70 million views in its first 24 hours.[183] On July 5, Moneymaker: Behind the Black Widow, a half-hour documentary special centered on Johansson's stunt double Heidi Moneymaker, premiered on ESPN+ as part of ESPN's E60 series. The special was directed by Martin Khodabakhshian and narrated by Johansson. A subsequent, eight-minute version of the special aired on ESPN's Outside the Lines on July 10.[184][185] An episode of the series Marvel Studios: Legends was released on July 7, exploring Black Widow using footage from her previous MCU appearances.[186]\n\nBlack Widow premiered on June 29, 2021, at various red carpet fan events in London, Los Angeles, Melbourne, and New York City.[187][188] It was screened at the Taormina Film Fest on July 3,[189] and was released in the United States on July 9, simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access for US$30.[149] It premiered in 46 territories over the course of its first weekend. In the U.S. it opened in 4,100 theaters, with 375 in IMAX, over 800 in premium large formats, 1,500 in 3D, and 275 in specialty D-Box, 4DX, and ScreenX theaters.[190] In IMAX screenings, approximately 22 minutes of the film appeared in IMAX's expanded aspect ratio.[191] Black Widow is the first film released in Phase Four of the MCU.[192][148] Release dates for China, Taiwan, India, parts of Australia, and other Southeast Asia and Latin America markets were not set by the film's opening weekend,[193] and by September the film was not expected to be released theatrically in China.[194] Black Widow was the first of several MCU films to not receive a theatrical release in China, a \"de facto ban\" that was not lifted until 2023.[195]\n\nThe film was originally scheduled for release on May 1, 2020.[19] In early March 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic had caused the closure of theaters in many countries, the release date for the film No Time to Die was shifted from April 2020 to November 2020. Commentators began speculating about the potential for other major films like Black Widow to be postponed as well. Deadline Hollywood reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that Black Widow would take the November release date of Marvel's Eternals, with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney said that it still intended to release Black Widow in May 2020.[196] After a trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at Forbes said the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed. He said this was \"the logical choice\" because it was an ideal release date for the film and there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect its performance in the U.S.[177] A week later, theaters across the U.S. were closed due to the pandemic and gatherings larger than 50 people were discouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Disney removed the film from its May release date.[146] Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly at Variety questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by pandemic delays than other franchises due to its interconnected nature. A Marvel Studios source told them that changing the film's release date would not affect the MCU timeline, and the pair speculated that this was due to the film being a prequel.[197] In April, Disney gave Eternals's November 6, 2020, release date to Black Widow and shifted all other Phase Four films back in the release schedule to accommodate this.[147]\n\nAnthony D'Alessandro of Deadline Hollywood reported in September 2020 that Disney was considering rescheduling Black Widow again,[198] with Variety also reporting this and attributing it to the low box office returns for Disney's Mulan in China and Warner Bros.' Tenet in North America.[199] Later that month, Disney pushed the release to May 7, 2021, rescheduling Eternals and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) as a result.[148] In January 2021, Feige said he still expected Black Widow to debut in theaters,[200] but Variety reported that Disney was considering releasing the film on its streaming service Disney+. There was also potential to delay the film's release again, or release it concurrently in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access—as was done with Disney's Raya and the Last Dragon (2021)—if the effects of the pandemic did not improve leading up to May 2021. Variety felt it would be \"insurmountably more challenging\" for Black Widow to become profitable if it did not have a traditional theatrical release.[201][202] In early February, Disney CEO Bob Chapek reaffirmed that Black Widow was intended to be solely released in theaters, but Disney was cognizant of theaters reopening, particularly in large cities such as New York and Los Angeles, as well as consumer desire to return to theaters.[203] According to Variety, Feige was opposed to a hybrid release for the film.[204] If the film was delayed again, the film distribution industry believed Disney would move it to July 9, 2021, which at that point was the release date for Shang-Chi.[205] Chapek reiterated the next month that Disney planned to release Black Widow in theaters on May 7,[206] while Deadline Hollywood again noted the possibilities of delaying the film, releasing it simultaneously on Disney+, or releasing it in theaters for a short time before making it available on Disney+.[206] Chapek soon stated that Disney was remaining flexible as they gauged consumer behavior, and they would make a final decision at the \"last minute\".[207]\n\nIn late March, Disney moved the film's release date to July 9, 2021, and announced that it would be released simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access. Shang-Chi was delayed again as a result. Kareem Daniel, the chairman of Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, said the simultaneous release gave fans options to see the film while serving the \"evolving preferences of audiences\".[149] Chaim Gartenberg at The Verge opined that Disney had to move forward with a simultaneous release because they could not afford to delay Marvel's Phase Four television series, which were some of the few \"high-profile, must-watch shows\" on Disney+ and once they began with WandaVision in January 2021 there was only so long that the films could be delayed before the interconnected nature of Marvel's storytelling began causing issues. For instance, the series Hawkeye was expected to be released later in 2021 and contain spoilers for Black Widow, so the film needed to be released before then. Gartenberg said Disney and Marvel were victims of their own success, but felt the potential revenue loss from the simultaneous release could lead to long-term positives such as fans who otherwise would not have watched Marvel's series potentially discovering them when signing up for Disney+ to watch Black Widow.[208]\n\nIn July 2021, Johansson filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court against The Walt Disney Company, alleging that the simultaneous release of Black Widow in theaters and on Disney+ breached a stipulation in her contract that the film be released exclusively in theaters.[101] The suit claimed that the simultaneous release exempted Disney from paying \"very large box office bonuses\" that Johansson would have been entitled to.[209] According to The Wall Street Journal, Johansson had been concerned about the possibility of the film being released on Disney+ as early as prior to the release of Avengers: Endgame when Black Widow was still in development.[210] Vulture contributor Chris Lee opined that not having any planned appearances in future MCU projects might have influenced Johansson's decision to move forward with filing the lawsuit.[211] Disney issued a statement in response to the suit, saying it had \"no merit whatsoever\" and that Johansson had shown a \"callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\". The company claimed that they had fully complied with Johansson's contract and that the Disney+ Premier Access release of the film had \"significantly enhanced [Johansson's] ability to earn additional compensation\" beyond the $20 million she had already received for the film.[101]\n\nBryan Lourd, Johansson's agent and co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency, condemned Disney's response as \"shamelessly and falsely accus[ing] Ms. Johansson of being insensitive to the global COVID pandemic\". He accused the company of \"leaving artistic and financial partners\" out of their streaming profits and denounced the disclosure of Johansson's $20 million earnings as \"an attempt to weaponize her success as an artist and businesswoman, as if that were something she should be ashamed of\".[212][213] The advocacy organizations Women in Film, ReFrame, and Time's Up jointly denounced Disney's response, calling it a \"gendered character attack\" and saying they \"stand firmly against Disney's recent statement which attempts to characterize Johansson as insensitive or selfish for defending her contractual business rights\".[214] TheWrap reported that Johansson was shocked by the tone of Disney's response,[215] while Disney chairman and former CEO Bob Iger was allegedly mortified.[216] Feige was reported to be angered and embarrassed by Disney's handling of the situation, and wanted the company to make it right with Johansson.[217] SAG-AFTRA president Gabrielle Carteris also condemned Disney's response, saying they \"should be ashamed of themselves for resorting to tired tactics such as gender-shaming and bullying\".[218] In response to these criticisms, Disney attorney Daniel Petrocelli called the suit a \"highly orchestrated [public relations] campaign to achieve an outcome that is not obtainable in a lawsuit\".[219]\n\nEriq Gardner at The Hollywood Reporter believed Johansson's case was potentially weak since disputes of this kind usually take place in arbitration, and that she had been forced into presenting a claim of tortious interference rather than a standard contract breach due to a clause in her contract. Gardner added that Disney could defend not waiting for the market to recover from the pandemic since they had already delayed the film's release by a year and needed Black Widow to be released so they could continue the MCU, considering the film introduces important new characters such as Yelena Belova who was expected to appear in future MCU projects.[220] Screen Daily editor Matt Mueller told BBC News that he expected the case would be resolved between Disney and Johansson before reaching court, and expressed surprise that Disney had let it get to this stage, given Warner Bros. had made agreements with stars for simultaneous releases in theaters and on HBO Max for films like Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). Mueller also believed the case would prompt other studios with streaming services to look at what contractual steps they would need to prevent further legal action like this.[221] Variety reported in July 2021 that the case had prompted other Disney actors to consider similar litigations.[213]\n\nIn August 2021, Disney filed a motion to move the lawsuit to arbitration, citing that Black Widow had outgrossed other MCU films in its opening weekend with an \"impressive pandemic-era showing\".[222] Johansson's attorney John Berlinski criticized this move as an attempt by Disney to \"hide its misconduct in a confidential arbitration\", while calling the company's initial response to the case misogynistic.[223] The suit was settled a month later under undisclosed terms, though Deadline Hollywood reported that Johansson would receive over $40 million from Disney.[224][225] The settlement came after Disney chose to give theatrical-only releases to subsequent 2021 films following the box office success of Shang-Chi and Free Guy (2021), which both received exclusive theatrical windows when initially released.[226] In November 2021, Johansson said in regards to the lawsuit that she felt \"very fortunate that nobody will have to go through what I went through\" and thought the case had made \"a positive impact in the industry and hopefully for artists and creatives' lives and livelihood[s].\"[227]\n\nBlack Widow was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on digital download in the U.S. on August 10, 2021, and was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on September 14. Deleted scenes, a gag reel, and behind-the-scenes featurettes were included. The film was made available to all Disney+ subscribers starting October 6.[228] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ on November 12.[229]\n\nBlack Widow grossed $183.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $196.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $379.8 million.[3][4] The film's opening weekend earned $226.2 million globally, which included $80.4 million at the domestic box office, $78.8 million at the international box office, and $67 million in Disney+ Premier Access global revenue.[6][7] The opening weekend gross was within or had exceeded various pre-release projections.[190][230] In June 2021, Fandango reported that the film had the most ticket presales in 2021, and surpassed other MCU films from previous years like Doctor Strange (2016) and Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).[231]\n\nBlack Widow earned $39.5 million on its opening day, including $13.2 million from Thursday night previews, which was the best preview night and opening day since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Its total weekend gross was $80.4 million, making it the top film of the weekend.[5][232][233] This was the largest box office opening since the COVID-19 pandemic began, surpassing F9's opening of $70 million,[193] and the largest opening weekend since Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019).[5] The domestic gross was within some of the pre-release projections for the film,[190][230] but it was below some updated industry projections that were made during the weekend after the opening night and preview grosses were known; Deadline Hollywood partially attributed this to the film's availability on Disney+ with Premier Access.[5] When the $80.4 million theatrical gross was combined with the domestic Premier Access revenue of $55 million, totaling over $135.4 million for its opening weekend, Disney noted that Black Widow was the only film to surpass $100 million in domestic consumer spend on opening weekend since the start of the pandemic, and it marked the third largest opening ever for an MCU origin film behind Black Panther ($202 million) and Captain Marvel ($153.4 million).[5][223] Following its opening weekend, Black Widow posted the largest non-holiday Monday ($7.16 million) and Tuesday ($7.6 million) gross in the pandemic.[234] The film passed $100 million at the domestic box office in six days, the fastest to do so in the pandemic.[235]\n\nIn its second weekend, the film grossed $25.8 million,[236] finishing second behind Space Jam: A New Legacy. Its 67% drop marked the largest sophomore week decline for an MCU film, passing Ant-Man and the Wasp (62%).[237] Box office analysts attributed Black Widow's second-week decline to its Disney+ Premier Access release, as well as widely reported piracies of the film online.[238][239] In its third weekend, the film earned a further $11.6 million and became the fastest film to reach $150 million in total domestic box office gross in the pandemic.[240][241] Black Widow was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2021 in the United States and Canada.[242]\n\nOutside of North America, Black Widow earned $78.8 million in its opening weekend, from 46 markets. It was the number one film in nearly all of these markets, including the markets in the Asia Pacific region where it opened—excluding Japan, where it was third[6][243]—and all markets in the Latin America region. Black Widow had the top pandemic opening weekend in 15 European markets. IMAX accounted for $4.8 million of the weekend gross, from 59 countries, 11 of which set opening weekend records for the pandemic. In South Korea, the film's opening day was the second-best of 2021, with $3.3 million, and Hong Kong had the best opening of the pandemic, with $3.2 million. The film had the largest opening day of the pandemic in Austria, the Czech Republic, Qatar, and Slovakia, while in Saudi Arabia, the film earned the highest opening day for a Disney release ever. It was the number one film on opening day in many other markets. As of October 2021, the top markets for the film outside of North America were South Korea ($26.3 million), the United Kingdom ($25.8 million), and France ($15.1 million).[3][6]\n\nWith Disney+ Premier Access, Black Widow earned $67 million worldwide in its opening weekend.[6][7] It was the first film that Disney revealed Premier Access revenue for, with the revenue skewing heavily towards the United States with $55 million.[5][223] Viewer tracking application Samba TV, which measures at least five minutes of viewership on smart televisions in over 3 million U.S. households, reported that 1.1 million households watched the film in its opening weekend. Deadline Hollywood noted that this viewership translated to about $33 million in revenue for Disney, considering the US$30 price of Premier Access, which lined up with the announced worldwide revenue.[244] The site also stated that Disney was receiving about 85% of the Disney+ Premier revenue, sharing the rest with platform providers such as Amazon Firestick and Apple TV+.[245]\n\nThe following weekend, Deadline Hollywood reported that Black Widow had become the most-pirated film of the past week,[237] while some industry sources believed it had become the most-pirated film of the pandemic.[246] Samba TV later updated the film's Disney+ Premier Access viewership, reporting that the film had been streamed over 2 million times in the U.S. over its first 10 days of release, which resulted in around $60 million in overall domestic revenue from Disney+. Samba TV also reported updates to 10-day viewership in the United Kingdom (258,000), Germany (116,000), and Australia (47,000).[245] In October, Samba TV reported that over 1.1 million U.S. households had watched Black Widow in the first five days of its availability to all subscribers on Disney+. They also reported viewership in the United Kingdom (190,000) and Germany (96,000) during that same time frame.[247] As of August 2021, Black Widow had earned $125 million through streaming and digital downloads.[222] In its first 30 days, the film was watched in over 2.8 million U.S. households. Deadline Hollywood reported the film had been pirated over 20 million times, resulting in at least $600 million in lost revenue for Disney.[248] In January 2022, tech firm Akamai reported that Black Widow was the third-most pirated film of 2021.[249]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 79%, with an average score of 6.9/10, based on 462 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Black Widow's deeper themes are drowned out in all the action, but it remains a solidly entertaining standalone adventure that's rounded out by a stellar supporting cast.\"[250] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 58 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[251] Critics commonly praised the cast, particularly Johansson and Pugh, as well as the action sequences.[252][253][254] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported that 88% of audience members gave it a positive score and 69% said they would definitely recommend the film.[5]\n\nOwen Gleiberman of Variety initially feared that Black Widow would just be two hours of Johansson fighting, but found the film to be more interesting than that despite still having fight sequences that would \"give a mainstream audience that getting-your-money's-worth feeling\". He praised Shortland's direction and said, \"from the opening credits, most of it has a gritty, deliberate, zap-free tone that is strikingly—and intentionally—earthbound for a superhero fantasy\".[16] Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney felt the film's move away from the superhero genre into a \"high-octane espionage thriller\" made it a more satisfying female-starring MCU film than the \"blandly bombastic\" Captain Marvel.[255] At IGN, Nicole Clark discussed the ambition of the film to go beyond the superhero genre to explore the abuse and \"intense tragedy\" from Romanoff's past.[256]\n\nAt The Hollywood Reporter, Rooney described the film as a \"stellar vehicle\" for Johansson and praised her vulnerability in the film,[255] while Gleiberman said Johansson \"holds the film together and gives it its touch of soul\" with her vulnerability which he said was unusual for a superhero film performance.[16] Several critics praised the film's supporting cast,[254] with the chemistry between Johansson and Pugh in particular a highlight.[252] Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood said \"Natasha's awkward shyness [is] counterpunched by the lively and cynical Yelena\", and praised Johansson's presence in her role. He felt Pugh was ready to lead her own franchise and also praised the performances of Weisz, Harbour, and Winstone.[257] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said the relationship between Romanoff and Belova was the \"real love story\" of the film,[258] and Nicole Clark felt the film was at its strongest in the scenes where the pair were fighting against or beside each other.[256] Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com said Pugh was the film's MVP and had found \"just the right shades of strength and vulnerability\".[259] Caryn James at the BBC also praised Pugh and said Belova was \"more lived-in than most action-movie characters\".[260]\n\nIndieWire's Eric Kohn gave the film a B grade, saying it delivered on action and praising the lower stakes. He positively compared the film's fight sequences to the Bourne franchise and said, \"If this is the last time we get to see Johansson mete out justice to her assailants with gymnastic velocity, it's an apt send-off.\"[261] Hammond of Deadline Hollywood agreed, writing that Johansson \"goes out with all guns blazing as this [film...] does not stint one bit on the action\".[257] Gleiberman also compared the film to the Bourne franchise,[16] while James compared it to the Mission: Impossible franchise and said it was \"the least Avenger-like movie in the [MCU] so far\". She gave the film four out of five stars, but did criticize the ending as being typical of the franchise.[260] Writing for Vanity Fair, Richard Lawson praised Shortland's direction of the action sequences and the film's more grounded physics.[262]\n\nDespite calling the film stylish and fun, Joshua Rivera of Polygon said it came across as \"hollow\" and like an \"apology\" for Romanoff's death in Endgame.[263] Similarly, Hoai-Tran Bui at /Film felt the film was \"too little, too late\" after the character's death,[264] and Matt Goldberg at Collider felt the film wasted the chance to further explore the Budapest mission in Romanoff's past in favor of introducing Belova as a replacement Black Widow.[265] Ann Hornaday at The Washington Post had similar thoughts, noting the set-up for Pugh to continue in the franchise and feeling the film did not make up for Johansson getting \"short shrift\" in earlier MCU installments.[266]\n\nBlack Widow was one of 28 films that received the ReFrame Stamp for 2021, awarded by the gender equity coalition ReFrame for films that are proven to have gender-balanced hiring.[267]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced. The specials go behind the scenes of the MCU films and television series with cast members and additional creatives. A special for this film, \"The Making of Black Widow\", featuring Johansson,[284] was released on Disney+ on October 20, 2021.[285]\n\nPugh reprised her role as Belova in the Disney+ series Hawkeye, continuing the storyline that is set up by the film's post-credits scene.[153] In June 2021, Shortland expressed interest in directing another film in the MCU, and noted that a potential sequel to Black Widow would likely revolve around a different character following Romanoff's death.[286] Weisz said she would be interested in a future storyline featuring Vostokoff assuming her Iron Maiden comic book persona.[55] In March 2023, Jeff Sneider at Above the Line reported that the in-development MCU ensemble film Thunderbolts* (2025) was being re-written after its initial script from Black Widow writer Eric Pearson had focused too much on the Black Widow characters that were confirmed to be returning for that film: Pugh's Belova, Harbour's Shostakov, and Kurylenko's Taskmaster, as well as Louis-Dreyfus's De Fontaine.[287][288]\n"

        "content": "\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a 2021 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Shang-Chi. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 25th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Destin Daniel Cretton from a screenplay he wrote with Dave Callaham and Andrew Lanham, and stars Simu Liu as Shang-Chi alongside Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu, Benedict Wong, Yuen Wah, Michelle Yeoh, Ben Kingsley, and Tony Leung. In the film, Shang-Chi is forced to confront his past when his father Wenwu (Leung), the leader of the Ten Rings terrorist organization, draws Shang-Chi and his sister Xialing (Zhang) into a search for a mythical village.\n\nA film based on Shang-Chi entered development in 2001, but work did not begin in earnest until December 2018 when Callaham was hired. Cretton joined in March 2019 and the film's title and primary cast were announced that July. This revealed the film's connection to the Ten Rings organization, which previously appeared throughout the MCU, and its leader Wenwu who was adapted from the problematic comic book characters Fu Manchu and the Mandarin. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the first Marvel Studios film with an Asian director and a predominantly Asian cast. Filming began in Sydney in February 2020 but was put on hold in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed in August and ended in October, with additional filming in San Francisco. Brad Allan and other members of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team coordinated the fight sequences.\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on August 16, 2021, and was released in the United States on September 3 as part of Phase Four of the MCU. It grossed over $432 million worldwide, making it the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2021. It set several box office records and received positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the exploration and representation of Asian culture which differentiated the film from the rest of the MCU, as well as the action sequences and Leung's performance. The film received various accolades, including a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 94th Academy Awards. A sequel is in development.\n\nA thousand years ago, Xu Wenwu discovers the mystical ten rings which grant godly powers including immortality. He establishes the Ten Rings organization, conquering kingdoms and toppling governments throughout history. In 1996, Wenwu searches for Ta Lo, a village said to harbor mythical beasts. He travels through a magical forest to the village entrance but is stopped by a guardian, Ying Li. The two soon fall in love, but the Ta Lo villagers reject Wenwu so Li chooses to leave with him. They marry and have two children, Shang-Chi and Xialing. Wenwu abandons his organization and locks away the ten rings.\n\nWhen Shang-Chi is seven years old, Li is murdered by Wenwu's enemies, the Iron Gang. Wenwu dons the rings once again, massacres the Iron Gang, and resumes leadership of his organization. He makes Shang-Chi undergo brutal training in martial arts but does not allow Xialing to train, prompting her to secretly teach herself. When Shang-Chi is 14, Wenwu sends him to assassinate the Iron Gang's leader. After completing his mission, a traumatized Shang-Chi runs away to San Francisco and adopts the name \"Shaun\".\n\nIn the present day, Shang-Chi works as a parking valet with his best friend Katy. They are attacked on a bus by the Ten Rings organization who steal a pendant that Li gave to Shang-Chi. Shang-Chi travels to Macau to find Xialing, fearing that the Ten Rings will go after her matching pendant. He reveals his past to Katy who insists on helping him. They find Xialing at a secret fight club which she founded after escaping from Wenwu at 16. The Ten Rings attack the fight club and Wenwu arrives to capture Shang-Chi, Katy, Xialing, and her pendant.\n\nAt the Ten Rings' compound, Wenwu uses the pendants to reveal a mystical map leading to Ta Lo. Wenwu explains that he has heard Li calling and believes she has been held captive in Ta Lo behind a sealed gate. He plans to destroy the village unless they release her. When his children and Katy object, he imprisons them. They meet former actor Trevor Slattery, whom the Ten Rings imprisoned for impersonating Wenwu,[a] and his hundun companion Morris. They escape and Morris guides them to Ta Lo, which exists in a separate dimension with various Chinese mythological creatures.\n\nThe group meet Li's sister Ying Nan who explains the history of Ta Lo: thousands of years ago, the village's universe was attacked by the soul-consuming Dweller-in-Darkness and its soul eaters, but was saved by a Chinese dragon called the Great Protector who helped seal the Dark Gate to the Dweller's world. According to Nan, the Dweller-in-Darkness has been impersonating Li so Wenwu will use the ten rings to open the Gate. Shang-Chi, Xialing, Katy, Slattery, and Morris join the villagers in training and preparing for Wenwu's arrival, using outfits and weapons crafted from dragon scales that are effective against the soul eaters.\n\nWenwu and the Ten Rings arrive and attack. Wenwu overpowers Shang-Chi, pushes him into the nearby lake, and attacks the Gate with the rings. This allows some of the Dweller's soul eaters to escape, with the Ten Rings allying with the villagers to effectively fight them. The Great Protector revives Shang-Chi and bears him from the lake to battle the soul eaters. Wenwu and Shang-Chi fight once more, and Shang-Chi gains the upper hand but chooses to spare Wenwu. The Dweller-in-Darkness escapes from the weakened Gate and attacks Shang-Chi. Wenwu saves Shang-Chi but is killed by the Dweller-in-Darkness; he bequeaths the rings to Shang-Chi before he dies. Shang-Chi, the Great Protector, Xialing, and Katy slay the Dweller-in-Darkness. Afterward, Shang-Chi and Katy return to San Francisco where the sorcerer Wong summons them to Kamar-Taj.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Wong introduces Shang-Chi and Katy to Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers and the group discusses the origins of the rings. They discover that the rings are acting as a beacon to something. In a post-credits scene, Xialing becomes the new leader of the Ten Rings, despite telling Shang-Chi that she would disband the organization, and begins training women alongside men.\n\nAlso appearing in the film are Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon, Xialing's right-hand man and announcer at her underground fighting club; Jodi Long as Mrs. Chen, Katy's mother; Dallas Liu as Ruihua, Katy's brother; Paul He as Chancellor Hui; Tsai Chin as Katy's grandmother;[17] Andy Le as Death Dealer, one of Wenwu's assassins who trained Shang-Chi in his youth;[37] Stephanie Hsu and Kunal Dudheker as Soo and John, married friends of Shang-Chi and Katy;[17] Zach Cherry as Klev, a bus rider who livestreams one of Shang-Chi's fights (after portraying a street vendor in 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming);[17][38] and Dee Baker as the voice of Morris, a hundun who befriends Slattery.[39] Jade Xu reprises her role as a Black Widow named Helen from Black Widow (2021),[40] while Tim Roth provides uncredited vocals for his The Incredible Hulk (2008) character Abomination.[41][42] Mark Ruffalo and Brie Larson appear, uncredited, in the mid-credits scene, reprising their respective MCU roles of Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel.[43]\n\nAccording to Margaret Loesch, former president and CEO of Marvel Productions, Stan Lee discussed a potential film or television series based on the Marvel Comics character Shang-Chi with actor Brandon Lee and his mother Linda Lee during the 1980s, with the intention of having Brandon Lee star as the character.[44] Brandon's father, martial arts legend Bruce Lee, was the visual inspiration for artist Paul Gulacy when drawing Shang-Chi during his tenure on the Master of Kung Fu comic book in the 1970s.[45] In 2001, Stephen Norrington signed on to direct a Shang-Chi film entitled The Hands of Shang-Chi.[46][47] By 2003, it was in development at DreamWorks Pictures with Yuen Woo-Ping replacing Norrington as director and Bruce C. McKenna writing the screenplay.[48] Ang Lee joined the project as a producer in 2004, but it did not materialize and the rights to the character reverted to Marvel.[47] In September 2005, Marvel chairman and CEO Avi Arad announced Shang-Chi as one of ten properties being developed as films by the newly formed Marvel Studios,[49] after the company received financing to produce the slate with Paramount Pictures as distributor.[50] Marvel thought the character could make a great film, despite being relatively unknown, because he has a \"very Disney story\" in the comic books.[13]\n\nThe Ten Rings organization was introduced in Marvel Studios' first Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film, Iron Man (2008), without its leader the Mandarin. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige felt they could not do the character justice in the Iron Man films because they focused on Tony Stark / Iron Man, and planned to introduce him in a later film instead.[51] According to Chris Fenton, former president of the Chinese-based film production company DMG Entertainment that was in talks with Marvel Studios to co-produce their films, Marvel offered to create a teaser featuring either Shang-Chi or the Mandarin for the Chinese market that would be featured at the end of The Avengers (2012). DMG balked at the offer since the Mandarin's negative stereotypical portrayal in the comics could potentially prevent the film from being released in China and risk DMG being shut down. The Mandarin would eventually appear in the DMG co-produced film Iron Man 3 (2013) portrayed by Ben Kingsley, but he is revealed to be an actor named Trevor Slattery who was hired to pose as the Mandarin.[52] Feige felt this did not necessarily mean a more faithful version of the character did not exist in the MCU,[51] and this was confirmed in the Marvel One-Shot short film All Hail the King (2014) in which Kingsley reprised his role as Slattery.[53][54]\n\nBy December 2018, Marvel had fast-tracked development of a Shang-Chi film with the intent of making it their first film with an Asian lead. Marvel hired Chinese-American writer Dave Callaham to write the screenplay, and began looking at Asian and Asian-American filmmakers to potentially direct the film. The studios' goal was to have Asian and Asian-American filmmakers explore themes related to their culture, as they had done for African and African-American culture with Black Panther earlier in 2018.[55] Development of the film also came following the success of the film Crazy Rich Asians that was likewise released earlier in 2018 and led to several other Asian-led properties being developed by Hollywood studios.[56] Callaham's script was expected to modernize elements of the comic book story, which was first written in the 1970s, to avoid what modern audiences would consider to be negative stereotypes.[55] When Callaham began work on the script, he became emotional realizing it was the first project where he was asked to write \"from my own experience, from my own perspective\".[11] Jessica Gao, who would later become the head writer of the Marvel Studios television series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022), also presented a pitch for the film.[57] Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter said the film could \"break out in a way similar to Black Panther\" by bringing a new perspective to the character. Newby felt Shang-Chi could have worked well as a television series, and said it \"speaks volumes\" that Marvel would decide to make a feature film about the character instead. Newby concluded that the film was an opportunity to avoid stereotypes about Asian martial artists and be \"more than Marvel's Bruce Lee\".[58]\n\nMarvel Studios hired Japanese-American filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton to direct the film in March 2019. Deborah Chow—who previously directed episodes of Marvel Television's Iron Fist (2017–2018) and Jessica Jones (2015–2019) series—Justin Tipping, and Alan Yang were also considered.[59] Cretton had previously not been interested in directing a superhero film, but was drawn to the project to help create a world and character that Asian children could look up to and see themselves in.[7] His pitch included visual inspiration from Chinese, South Korean, Japanese, and other Asian cinema, including anime, to highlight a tone that showed \"the drama and the pain of life, but also show[ed] the humor of life\".[60] In April, Marvel Studios and Australian Arts Minister Mitch Fifield announced that an upcoming Marvel film, believed to be Shang-Chi, would be filmed at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney and on location throughout the state of New South Wales. The production received AU$24 million (US$18 million) in one-off funding from the Australian government, as well as backing from the AU$10 million (US$8 million) \"Made in NSW\" state fund. The production was expected to generate AU$150 million (US$113 million) for the Australian economy as well as 4,700 new jobs, while taking advantage of around 1,200 local businesses.[61] Don Harwin, the New South Wales Arts Minister, confirmed in July that this film was Shang-Chi and it would be produced back-to-back with Marvel Studios' Thor: Love and Thunder (2022).[62] Production on Shang-Chi was set to begin in early 2020 and be completed later that year.[62][63]\n\nMarvel Studios began testing actors in their 20s for the role of Shang-Chi in mid-July 2019,[64] including Lewis Tan and Simu Liu;[6][65] Tan previously portrayed Zhou Cheng in Iron Fist.[65] The studio was adamant that actors be of Chinese descent to audition for the character.[64] Liu was considered earlier in the audition process and was brought back in for a second audition when the creatives were finding it difficult to cast the role.[51] He tested again on July 14 and was officially cast on July 16.[6] Awkwafina, who was the first actor cast for the film, had chemistry tests with the potential actors and said \"it was apparent that [Liu] was Shang-Chi from the jump\".[9] Liu and Awkwafina's castings were announced by Cretton and producer Feige at Marvel Studios' San Diego Comic-Con panel on July 20, where the film's full title was announced to be Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Feige noted the connection between this title and the Ten Rings organization that had appeared throughout the MCU. He said the group's leader, the Mandarin, would be introduced in this film and Tony Leung had been cast in the role.[6] Cretton had wanted to cast Leung but was doubtful he would accept the part. Despite this hesitation, producer Jonathan Schwartz decided to contact Leung and he accepted the role after a meeting with Cretton.[66]\n\nIn December, Feige said the film would feature a predominantly Asian cast.[67] A month later, Michelle Yeoh entered talks for a role in the film. This was for a different character than Aleta Ogord, who Yeoh had briefly portrayed in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017).[68] Jessica Henwick, who previously portrayed Colleen Wing in Marvel Television's Netflix series, was asked to audition for the role of Xialing in the film,[69] but was concurrently offered the role of Bugs in The Matrix Resurrections (2021). After being given an ultimatum to select one of the roles by the respective studios, Henwick chose the Resurrections part.[70] This was partially because she hoped to reprise the role of Wing in a future MCU production.[69] Newcomer Meng'er Zhang was eventually cast in the role.[17] Kingsley reprises his role as Slattery in the film.[71] The character's inclusion was planned early on to help fully explore the \"context of who the Mandarin is in the MCU\".[72] Schwartz called Slattery a \"secret weapon\" whose introduction part-way through the film moves it in a different direction and provides comic relief.[32]\n\nIn addition to Callaham, Cretton and Andrew Lanham also contributed to the screenplay for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings from a story by Callaham and Cretton.[28][73] The film was described as a \"sweeping superhero epic that combines emotional family drama with gravity-defying martial arts action\". Schwartz said much of Shang-Chi's arc within Marvel Comics is a family drama, and Cretton wanted to focus on that element for the film, exploring Shang-Chi's broken and abusive family background. Liu noted that the comic book backstory for Shang-Chi is not widely known like those for comic book characters such as Batman or Spider-Man, and that gave the film's writers freedom to take more creative liberties with the story. Cretton and Callaham were cognizant of some of the racial stereotypes surrounding the character in the comics, with Liu saying everyone involved was \"very sensitive to not have it go into stereotypical territory\". Cretton believed the resulting script was a \"really beautiful update\" to the character from what began in the comics.[7]\n\nCretton felt the film told an authentic story about Asian identity.[7] Callaham said there is \"no single Asian American voice\", and he and Cretton contemplated how the film could speak to \"the wider Asian diaspora\" and would be generally entertaining but also \"personal to all these people\".[11] Cast members Liu, Leung, and Zhang contributed their own experiences coming from Canada, Hong Kong, and mainland China, respectively, to add to the authenticity of the film. Some aspects that were discussed regarding each scene were whether characters should be speaking in Chinese Mandarin or English and the type of food served in the different households to ensure it felt authentic to whose house it was. The film's opening begins with narration entirely in Mandarin, which Nancy Wang Yuen, writing for io9, said was a striking decision for an MCU film to \"begin in a language other than English and continue to do so for an extended period\". Regarding the use of Mandarin in the film, Cretton said the choice of which language to use when was \"always rooted in just the logic of the characters and who would naturally be speaking what language\". Zhang, whose first language is Mandarin, served as a dialect coach for the other actors. Shang-Chi further deals with some of the negative characterization around Asian-Americans and languages by portraying its characters as having varied knowledge of Asian languages, as demonstrated by an exchange with Katy and the character Jon Jon when Jon Jon says he speaks \"ABC\" (American-born Chinese). Another such moment is when Shang-Chi teaches Katy how to pronounce his name, which serves as a meta moment to also aid the audience on learning the proper pronunciation of \"Shang-Chi\".[74]\n\nCretton felt it was important to have \"many strong women\" around Shang-Chi that were \"kicking his butt into gear\" in contrast to the relationship between Shang-Chi and his father Wenwu (the film's version of the Mandarin). These supporting characters also have their own narrative arcs.[24] Cretton's three sisters and his wife helped inspire the characters Katy, Xialing, Ying Nan, and Ying Li.[75] Speaking to the relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy, Cretton enjoyed being able to show a strong, \"deeply caring\" friendship that is rarely seen in superhero films, adding that it would have felt forced to have the two characters end up in a romantic relationship together.[76] Yeoh requested a scene be added between her character Ying Nan and Zhang's Xialing that would empower Xialing to \"step out of the shadows for the first time\"; this scene became an important part of Xialing's journey in the film and was one of the many scenes that also addressed the sexism presented in the story.[24] Cretton felt seeing Xialing become the new head of the Ten Rings organization in the film's post-credits scene was reflective of her beginning to take control of her life. Various versions of the scene existed throughout the production before it was moved to be after the credits since they thought it was \"a juicy idea for where the story might go in the future\".[43]\n\nSue Chan served as production designer for the film. The first location that she and the crew scouted was San Francisco, where Chan previously lived. She suggested Clement Street, \"the old Chinatown of San Francisco\", as the characters' home because it does not have the expected Chinatown cliches. The film's San Francisco apartment set was one of Chan's favorites due to its accuracy to real Asian-American houses. Another favorite was a restaurant set where Wenwu kills his enemies, for which Chan took inspiration from Hong Kong gangster films. Cretton wanted Xialing's fight club to be fun and show her character rather than be scary and dangerous. Chan noted that Xialing's office combines imagery of skulls with flowers and bold colors, and the sets incorporate the character's feminist views. The fighting arena is an octagon because the number eight is significant in Asian cultures.[77]\n\nFor Ta Lo, Chan researched ancient Chinese culture and designs and took elements from many eras since the village is not from a specific time in Chinese history. These elements includes symbolism, styles, and colors from the Tang and Song dynasties. Key symbols for the village were the five Chinese elements of wood, water, fire, metal, and earth, with metal being replaced with dragon scales for the film. These elements were used as the basis of the village set, along with traditional construction elements such as bamboo (both real and artificial bamboo was used). The village itself was built in an open area by a reservoir outside of Sydney and all of the buildings in the village were planned, built, and dressed as they would be used by the inhabitants. These include a pottery shed, a cooking shed, and a schoolroom, all built around the central temple which is open on all sides and contains the history of Ta Lo.[77][78] Ta Lo's universe is inhabited by various Chinese mythological creatures, including dragons, fenghuang, shishi, hundun, jiuwei hu, and qilin.[79][80] Andy Park led Marvel Studios' visual development team for the film, and specifically designed Shang-Chi's hero costume. The costume combines elements of his own style with those from both his parents: the jacket is made from the Ta Lo dragon scales and is a gift from his mother, he receives the ten rings from his father at the end of the film, and he wears his own American shoes.[81] Costume designer Kym Barrett also researched ancient Chinese designs and then adapted these to suit the film's stunt needs.[82]\n\nThe Ten Rings logo that was originally designed for the MCU featured a circle of ten interlocked rings with characters from the Mongolian language. The logo's appearance in Iron Man 3 drew ire from the Mongolian government who felt the Mongolian scripts \"offensively tied the country's intangible cultural heritage to a terrorist group\". The logo was updated for Shang-Chi to use \"inoffensive\" Chinese characters instead, including synonyms for strength or power written in ancient seal script. Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, Mongolia's former minister of culture, sports and tourism, believed the change was more to appease the Chinese market than the Mongolian government.[83] The actual ten rings are portrayed as bangles worn on the wrist rather than as finger rings like they are in the comics. Schwartz said multiple approaches to the rings were discussed, and the comic-accurate design looked \"a little goofy in practice\" and was too similar to the Infinity Stones that appear throughout the MCU.[84] The Ten Rings compound goes through four stages in the film that reflect Wenwu's character: it begins as a \"cold\" fortress that prominently features the Ten Rings logo; the compound then becomes a family home with bright colors, gardens, design elements from the Ta Lo village, and a mosaic of a phoenix replacing the Ten Rings logo; the color was then stripped from the sets to make it a \"desolate shell\" as Wenwu mourns the death of his wife; and finally elements of Xialing's fight club are introduced in the post-credits scene as she takes over the compound and makes it her own.[77][78]\n\nPrincipal photography began in February 2020,[85][86] shooting at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney and on location throughout the state of New South Wales,[61] under the working title Steamboat.[87] William Pope served as cinematographer for the film, shooting on the Arri Alexa LF.[88] Cretton chose Pope because he felt the cinematographer's style could be both naturalistic and heightened, and because of Pope's work on The Matrix (1999) which Cretton believed had the right tone for an MCU film focused on Asian and Asian-American characters.[63] Pope already wanted to work with Cretton after being impressed by his film Short Term 12 (2013).[89] Cretton was inspired for his direction by Jackie Chan's filmography, the Ip Man series, Tai Chi Master (1993), and Kung Fu Hustle (2004) among others in the martial arts and kung-fu genres,[12] as well as anime and video games.[74]\n\nOn March 12, after studios had started halting production on films due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cretton decided to have himself tested for coronavirus after working closely with people who had potentially been exposed to it.[86][90] This was a precaution due to Cretton having a newborn baby, and he self-isolated while awaiting these results;[90] the test later came back negative.[86] While Cretton was self-isolating, Marvel suspended first unit production for the film but intended for other aspects such as second unit to continue as normal.[90] On March 13, the rest of the film's production was paused as Disney halted filming on most of its projects.[91] Before the shut down, Ronny Chieng joined the cast in an undisclosed role.[92] In early April, Disney shifted much of the MCU's Phase Four slate of films due to the pandemic, moving Shang-Chi's release date to May 7, 2021.[93]\n\nWork building sets for the film resumed at the end of July 2020, and by August 2 all cast and crew members had arrived to begin shooting \"in the coming days\".[94] Any cast and crew returning to Australia had to be quarantined for two weeks upon arrival before returning to work, according to Australia's COVID-19 guidelines.[95] Later in August, Yeoh was confirmed to be appearing in the film.[96] The next month, the film's release date was pushed back to July 9, 2021, after Black Widow was shifted to the May 2021 date.[97] In October, filming took place in San Francisco, also under the working title Steamboat.[98] Due to the pandemic, crew in Australia could not travel to San Francisco for this filming.[77] Shooting locations included the Russian Hill, Noe Valley, and Nob Hill neighborhoods, as well as Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardelli Square.[99][100] Filming wrapped on October 24, 2020.[101]\n\nCretton wanted to use a range of different fighting styles in the film due to Shang-Chi being trained in different types of martial arts. These include the \"elegant, almost ethereal wushu style\" from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) and the \"kinetic\" fights of Jackie Chan's films. Supervising stunt coordinator Brad Allan along with other members of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team became responsible for making the different styles feel consistent,[7] as well as containing elements of Hong Kong action cinema.[60] Schwartz said there was a meaning for each fighting style in the film, and they helped to tell the story visually.[7] Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is dedicated to Allan, who died in August 2021.[102][103]\n\nThe bus fight sequence was part of Cretton's initial pitch for the film. He called it a \"what-if scenario\" that helped explain the kind of fight sequences he enjoyed, \"ones where the stakes just keep rising as the fight continues\". Once it was decided to include the sequence in the film and planning for it began, Cretton credited Allan for bringing the \"Buster Keaton-like physical comedy [to the fight], mixed with setups and payoffs, and stakes rising ... to almost ridiculous levels\".[42] The stunt team added a specific reference to Jackie Chan, who is known for this style of fighting, in which Shang-Chi takes off his jacket, spins it around while fighting, and puts it back on.[104] Fight coordinator Andy Cheng said the whole sequence took over a year to plan, going through as many as 20 different iterations, with most of the differences pertaining to the fighting within the bus. He said figuring out how the bus would be sliced in half and choreographing a fight around that was the most difficult part.[105] The stunt team put together 10 to 15 different \"stuntviz\" edits planning out the sequence.[88]\n\nTwo buses were shipped to Sydney for filming the sequence's interior shots. These buses were taken apart and re-assembled on a 15 feet (4.6 m) high gimbal and a 3.3 feet (1.0 m) high gimbal, with the windows and seats removed most of the time for safety.[77][105] The sequence was partially completed when the production shut down for COVID, requiring those involved to \"retune\" once production resumed.[105] Filming for the interior shots took around six weeks.[88] The exterior shots were filmed in San Francisco, with a different crew due to the pandemic.[77] The visual effects team planned out the shoot remotely so the unit could get the footage that was needed.[88] Four more buses were used for this portion of the sequence, including one that was filmed crashing down a hill into several cars.[104] The entire sequence was shot in 48 fps to help with tracking and making adjustments, and was then converted back to 24 fps. The shots in slow-motion were shot at 250 fps using a Phantom Camera.[88] The sequence ends at a real intersection in San Francisco that was partially filmed in Sydney and combined with footage from San Francisco by the visual effects team.[77] Cretton said there were some \"fudges\" in how accurate the sequence was to San Francisco—\"you can't go downhill for six minutes straight\"—but was mostly based on a real route,[104] suggested by Chan.[77] The bus is meant to be a Muni bus but different branding was used due to that company not wanting to be associated with a crashing bus.[104]\n\nCretton initially told Leung that he would not need to fight due to Wenwu's use of the ten rings, but the actor did ultimately have several fight sequences and only had two weeks to prepare for them. He said this was not difficult due to his experience acting in action films.[21] The character's first action scene, where he falls in love with Ying Li, took specific inspiration from the wuxia-style of films such as Hero (2002) which Leung starred in,[21][89][106] and he said filming the scene reminded him of his early career.[21] The fight in Macau on scaffolding outside Xialing's fightclub was filmed against bluescreen on several sets of scaffolding, including one that was built on a 45-degree gimbal to achieve a specific shot with Xialing.[88] The Kamehameha attack from the anime series Dragon Ball Z was an inspiration for the final fight between Shang-Chi and Wenwu, which Cretton also included in his pitch.[60]\n\nNat Sanders and Elísabet Ronaldsdóttir served as co-editors on the film,[107] alongside Harry Yoon.[108] In December 2020, Marvel revealed roles for several cast members, including Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's friend Katy, Yeoh as Jiang Nan, and Chieng as Jon Jon. They also announced the casting of Zhang as Xialing, Fala Chen as Jiang Li, and Florian Munteanu as Razor Fist;[109] Munteanu was cast after Marvel Studios was impressed with his role in Creed II (2018).[110] In March 2021, the film's release date was pushed back once again to September 3, 2021, when Black Widow was shifted to the July 2021 date,[111] and Dallas Liu was revealed to be appearing.[112]\n\nThe film's official trailer in June 2021 revealed that Benedict Wong would reprise his MCU role of Wong, and the character Emil Blonsky / Abomination would be appearing alongside him;[29][113] the Abomination first appeared in The Incredible Hulk (2008) portrayed by Tim Roth,[114] and Roth returned to provide uncredited vocals for the character in Shang-Chi.[41][42] Feige enjoyed returning to the Abomination after over a decade since his last MCU appearance, especially with the fans recognizing and embracing the reference in the trailer.[29] The characters were added to the film after Gao created a storyline for them in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, so the audience could be reminded of Abomination and get excited for their upcoming appearances in the series.[115][116] Wong was thrilled to be part of the film and its Asian cast, expressing excitement to be \"sat at a table of Asian excellence\".[117][118]\n\nThe film's mid-credits scene, which features Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and Brie Larson as Carol Danvers, was conceived late in production by Cretton to tease the origins of the ten rings. Several origins were written for the rings, but Callaham said none of these made a difference to the film's story so they decided to leave the origin ambiguous which meant it could be addressed in a later MCU project.[43] Cretton hoped they could feature Wong in the scene and have him go to karaoke with Shang-Chi and Katy to sing \"Hotel California\", but was unsure which additional Avengers characters would appear until late in post-production.[119] Banner and Danvers were chosen since they each represent the science and space aspects of the MCU, respectively,[43] and because their appearances align with other events in the MCU happening around the time of the scene.[119] Cretton also jokingly acknowledged that Larson's appearance continued her streak of appearing in his films after the pair worked together on Short Term 12, The Glass Castle (2017), and Just Mercy (2019).[42][43] Ruffalo and Larson filmed their roles in early 2021 during the film's additional photography.[119] Feige said the scene indicated how important Shang-Chi is to the MCU, likening it to Nick Fury's appearance in the post-credits scene of Iron Man.[120]\n\nChristopher Townsend was hired to be the visual effects supervisor for the film. He worked with eleven different vendors, and also hired the Australia-based Joe Farrell to serve as an additional supervisor working with another five vendors. They created more than 1,700 visual effects shots for the film. Farrell supervised the bus sequence in Sydney (and remotely for the San Francisco portion of shooting) and said it was one of the most complicated sequences he and Townsend had worked on. The scene featured 168 shots, with 40 to 50 of them being mostly digital. The environment required digital pieces for the bus, buildings, and people. Farrell said the sequence's motion made editing difficult, especially in regards to the nine passengers. They were mapped out to know where they were at all times and sometimes were digitally moved around. Because the Macau fight takes place on scaffolding outside a glass building, Rodeo FX had to rotoscope around the actors and replace the entire background. A digital version of downtown Macau was created based on reference filming that Farrell again supervised remotely.[88]\n\nThe map to Ta Lo went through many iterations to determine how that information should be conveyed. Cretton felt the completed scene, which uses water effects, connected well to the story and was \"visually beautiful\".[42] The film's main-on-end title sequence, designed by Perception, also focuses on the movement of water.[121] Rising Sun Pictures contributed more than 300 visual effects shots to the film and was primarily responsible for creating Ta Lo. They based the geography of the forest on different locations in Southeast Asia, and integrated this digital environment with some practical elements from material shot in Sydney. The team also worked with the Australian Institute for Machine Learning to develop an advanced technique for facial replacement, powered by artificial intelligence, which was used to replace the stunt double's faces with those of the principal actors for the action scenes.[122] The hundun Morris was inspired by Cretton's family dog, a 15-year-old dachshund. Images of hunduns, which do not have faces, were included during early development as potential inspiration for the film and Cretton wanted to feature one in the film in some way after seeing them. Morris was a green screen \"blob\" during filming, with Cretton crediting Kingsley for helping to \"breathe life into him\", making it feel as if Morris was a real character. Multiple different designs were tested for the character, including one that had him looking \"like a plucked chicken\", but the creatives wanted to ensure Morris remained cute, which was challenging since a character's eyes and face help convey their emotion. As such, they relied on the look of his fur and feathers.[123]\n\nWētā FX contributed more than 305 visual effects shots to the film, including creating the ten rings. Wētā visual effects supervisor Sean Walker said creating realistic-looking rings digitally was not complicated, but getting the correct movements for each character was; Shang-Chi uses the rings defensively while Wenwu uses them in an aggressive manner. Feige initially wanted the energy of each ring to have its own color as a reference to the comic book rings, which each have a different ability, but they found this to be too distracting.[124] Instead, the energy of the rings is based on who is using them, with warmer orange energy for Shang-Chi and a cooler blue color for Wenwu.[125] Wētā also created the Great Protector and the Dweller-in-Darkness for the final action sequence. The Great Protector's scales were initially based on quartz, porcelain, and shells before the team found images of albino lizards, alligators, and snakes that they thought were the perfect reference for the creature. The dragon's hair was then simulated on top. In contrast, the Dweller-in-Darkness was based on rhino and elephant hides and armored lizards. The souls that the Dweller-in-Darkness and its soul eaters consume were intended to be colorful visualizations of chakras but this was ultimately toned down to a more subtle effect.[124][126]\n\nJoel P. West, who scored Cretton's four previous films, returned to compose the score for Shang-Chi;[127] he acknowledged that this was the biggest film he had ever worked on. West began working on the film when Cretton was hired and developed his ideas throughout the filmmaking process. He wrote \"ominous\" and \"dominating\" music for Wenwu and more \"ethereal\" music for Ying Li, and then combined these to create Shang-Chi's music since the story is about him accepting both sides of his family. West spent months researching Chinese music so he could incorporate traditional Chinese elements into the score, primarily for Ying Li and Ta Lo.[128] Recording took place with a 70-piece London orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London by June 2021,[127][128] with the UK Chinese Ensemble also providing traditional Chinese instruments and performances for the score.[128]\n\nAn album featuring the film's score was released digitally by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records on September 1, 2021.[129] Marvel Music, Hollywood Records, and Interscope Records also released four separate singles inspired by the film ahead of its release: \"Lazy Susan\" by 21 Savage and Rich Brian,[130] \"Every Summertime\" by Niki,[131] \"Run It\" by DJ Snake, Rick Ross, and Rich Brian,[132] and \"In the Dark\" by Swae Lee & Jhené Aiko.[133] A soundtrack album was released on September 3 containing these in addition to songs by JJ Lin, Saweetie, Anderson .Paak, and other members of the \"next generation of Asian artists\". This was produced by Sean Miyashiro and 88rising, who worked with Cretton to tell a story in the album about the Asian-American experience with particular inspiration from San Francisco because that city is featured in the film.[134][135]\n\nOn April 19, 2021, which was Liu's birthday, he shared the first teaser poster for the film. This was shortly followed by Marvel releasing the first teaser trailer.[73] Adam B. Vary of Variety felt it was \"gratifying to finally see Liu in action as Shang-Chi\" and highlighted how the teaser provided further insight into details such as how the film would depict the Mandarin wearing the ten rings.[18] Cole Delbyck at HuffPost said the \"eye-popping\" action was unlike anything seen in past MCU films.[136] Writing for io9, Rob Bricken felt the teaser did not disappoint with its action, but the family drama was what made the film look compelling to him.[137] Collider's Adam Chitwood called the teaser \"pretty fantastic\", comparing its story and tone to Black Panther and saying Shang-Chi looked to be \"an exciting, fresh, and new Marvel Cinematic Universe experience\" based on the teaser.[73] Reactions to the poster and trailer in Chinese speaking regions in East Asia were more critical, with commentators believing both presented a stereotypical view of Chinese people and culture.[138]\n\nThe film's first full trailer was released on June 24, 2021, during ESPN's NBA Countdown. Sean Keane at CNET enjoyed seeing more of Leung in the trailer and called the fight sequences \"super-impressive\". He was surprised by the inclusion of Abomination at the end of the trailer and noted that the character looked more like his design from the comics than when he appeared in The Incredible Hulk.[139] Digital Spy's Gabriella Geisinger felt the Abomination's role in the film would just be a cameo appearance to set up the character's story in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law but also felt it could have \"wide-reaching implications\" for the MCU.[140] Germain Lussier of io9, Susana Polo of Polygon, and Jennifer Ouellette of Ars Technica all felt the trailer was a better showcase for Shang-Chi than the teaser was,[141][142][143] with Ouellette highlighting the different narration for the trailer that expanded on Shang-Chi's family background.[143] Lussier also noted a lot of new visual effects in the trailer that were not in the teaser, and felt Shang-Chi would soon become a big star despite not being a well-known character.[141]\n\nOn August 15, 2021, Ron Han created a GoFundMe drive to raise money for Asian American Pacific Islander (API) children at the Boys & Girls Club in San Gabriel Valley to see Shang-Chi, as well as a larger \"Shang-Chi challenge\" for other people to create similar drives for their communities; the challenge was inspired by a similar one created for Black Panther.[144][145] By the end of the month, API nonprofit organization Gold House partnered with GoFundMe to create the Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings Gold Open Community Fund to raise money for private screenings of the film for the API community and non-profit groups.[145] An episode of the series Marvel Studios: Legends was released on September 1, exploring the Ten Rings organization using footage from its previous MCU appearances.[146] Beginning September 3, Shang-Chi and Death Dealer began appearing in Disneyland's Avengers Campus.[147] Promotional partners for the film included Sanzo beverages, which released a limited edition version of lychee flavor; Microsoft;[148] BMW, which acted as the film's global car sponsor and had the BMW iX3 and BMW M8 appear in the film;[148][149] Old Spice;[150] and international sponsors including Visa, Virgin Plus, Gruppo TIM, Mikron Group, and BGF.[148]\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings had its world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre and TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on August 16, 2021,[151][152] and was screened at CinemaCon on August 25.[153] The film was released in international markets beginning on September 1, and had been released in 66% of its markets by the end of its first weekend.[154] The film was released in the United States on September 3,[155] in over 4,200 theaters, of which 400 were IMAX, over 850 were premium large format, 1,500 were 3D, and an additional 275 were the D-Box, 4DX, and ScreenX formats.[154] Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[156]\n\nShang-Chi was previously scheduled to be released on February 12, 2021,[6] the first day of the Chinese New Year,[157] before it was shifted to May 7,[93] and then to July 9, delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[97] The film shifted once again in March 2021 to the September 2021 date after Black Widow was moved to the July 9 release date.[111] In Australia, Shang-Chi was released on September 2, with a planned release in New South Wales, Victoria, and Australian Capital Territory on September 16 because of COVID-19-related state lockdowns;[158] it was ultimately released in New South Wales on October 11 when theaters in the state reopened.[159]\n\nThe film had a 45-day exclusive theatrical release, rather than being released simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access like Black Widow was.[155] In August 2021, with the increase of COVID-19 Delta variant cases, Disney CEO Bob Chapek explained that the film would stay theatrical-only for its 45-day window due to logisitical reasons and said this window was an interesting experiment for the company to learn more on how consumers wished to view their films;[160][161] Liu took issue with Chapek calling the film an experiment, but Feige later stated that Liu's response appeared to be based on a misunderstanding of Chapek's intention.[162]\n\nIn May 2021, a Chinese state media report excluded Shang-Chi, as well as Marvel's Eternals, from its list of upcoming MCU films being released. Variety noted that this added to rumors that the films would not be released in China.[138] In September 2021, Deadline Hollywood reported that a theatrical release in China was unlikely due to comments Liu made in an interview with the CBC in 2017 which referenced his parents' negative experiences living in China.[163] Disney still listed the film's release in China as \"to be determined\" in October,[164] but it ultimately did not receive a theatrical release in the country.[165]\n\nThe film was released on digital download on November 12, 2021,[166] as well as on Disney+ as part of the service's \"Disney+ Day\" celebration.[167] Disney+ also received the IMAX Enhanced version of the film.[168] It was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on November 30. The home media of the film includes audio commentary, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and various behind-the-scenes featurettes.[166]\n\nFollowing the release of Shang-Chi on Disney+, viewer tracking application Samba TV reported that over 1.7 million U.S. households watched the film within its first weekend of availability. Samba TV also reported viewership numbers for the United Kingdom (250,000), Germany (85,000), and Australia (17,000),[169] while TV Time reported that it was the most-streamed film in the United States during that same time frame.[170] Nielsen stated that it was the second-most-streamed film, behind Netflix's Red Notice, with a viewership of 1.072 billion minutes in its first week. Asian Americans made up 10% of the audience, the highest percentage for any title on the chart.[171] The film remained in the top five on Nielsen and TV Time's charts in the following weeks,[172][173] and TV Time stated that it was the sixth most-streamed-film globally in 2021.[174] The film was number one on the NPD Videoscan First Alert chart, which tracks combined sales of DVDs and Blu-rays, and the dedicated Blu-ray sales chart for two weeks.[175][176] It was the third most-selling title on disc for December 2021 according to the NPD Group.[177]\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings grossed $224.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $207.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $432.2 million.[4][5] It became the highest-grossing film ever released on Labor Day weekend,[148] and earned $13.2 million worldwide from IMAX, another Labor Day weekend record.[178]\n\nShang-Chi earned $29.6 million on its opening day (which included $8.8 million from its Thursday night previews), the third-best opening day since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The Thursday night previews gross was the second-highest of the pandemic, behind Black Widow ($13.2 million). It grossed $75.5 million over its three-day opening weekend, the second-largest of the pandemic behind Black Widow ($80.3 million). IMAX contributed $8 million, which was a record for a Labor Day weekend release. The film earned $94.67 million over the four-day Labor Day weekend, surpassing Halloween's (2007) $30.6 million to become the largest Labor Day weekend opening ever.[148] The film surpassed $100 million in five days, the fastest film to reach that milestone since Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) did it in its opening weekend.[179] Shang-Chi remained the number one film in its second weekend, earning $35.8 million which was the largest second weekend gross of the pandemic,[180] and in its third weekend when it earned $21.7 million, the second-largest third weekend gross for a September release behind It (2017).[181] It was the third MCU film following Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Black Panther to remain the top film for four consecutive weeks,[182] and was the first film of the pandemic era to surpassed $200 million in the United States and Canada when it did so on September 30.[183] It was the third-highest-grossing film in its fifth weekend,[184] the fourth-highest in its sixth weekend,[185] and remained in the top ten at the box office for two additional weekends.[186][187] The film ended its run at the United States and Canada box office as the second highest-grossing film of 2021 behind Spider-Man: No Way Home.[188]\n\nThe film earned $56.2 million from 41 markets in its opening weekend, opening number one in many.[178] The United Kingdom release had the largest opening day of the pandemic,[148] and the largest three-day opening weekend of the pandemic with $7.7 million. In Hong Kong, the film produced the largest September opening weekend, as well as the second-best opening during the pandemic. Nancy Tartaglione of Deadline Hollywood noted South Korea's $6.5 million opening was an underperformance for the market and an MCU film, though it was the first Hollywood film to open at number one there in several weeks.[178] In its second weekend, the film earned $35.2 million from 42 markets, remaining number one in several.[189] In its third weekend, the film earned an additional $20.3 million from 43 markets and was still the top film in territories such as Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and the UK.[190] The film remained at number one in all of the territories in its fourth weekend, when it opened in Indonesia. It was number one there as well with $1.2 million.[191] Shang-Chi was the top film in Australia for nine weekends, with its highest-grossing day coming on October 31, 2021.[192] As of October 2021, the film's largest markets are the United Kingdom ($27.1 million), South Korea ($14.9 million), and France ($11.5 million).[164]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 92%, with an average score of 7.5/10, based on 344 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings isn't entirely free of Marvel's familiar formula, but this exciting origin story expands the MCU in more ways than one.\"[193] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[194] Critics commonly praised the film's representation of Asian culture which differentiated it from other MCU films, as well as the performances and action sequences.[195] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 91% of audience members gave it a positive score and 78% said they would definitely recommend it.[148]\n\nPeter Debruge at Variety said the decision to give the \"second-tier\" Shang-Chi the same \"over-the-top treatment\" as major Marvel heroes had broadened Marvel Studios' cultural representation and would empower audiences of Asian descent in a similar way to what Black Panther did for audiences of African descent.[28] Angie Han of The Hollywood Reporter felt the film did not combine its martial-arts, fantasy elements, and exploration of Chinese and Asian-American culture \"as smoothly as [it] should\", but did find it to be a fresh and fun superhero film.[196] Giving the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, RogerEbert.com's Nick Allen said the film fit within Marvel's formula but had a soulfulness that other MCU films, as well as superhero and action films in general, did not have. He concluded that Shang-Chi was not an experiment for Marvel and Disney but rather \"a promising template for how they can get it right again\".[8] Writing for Empire, Laura Sirikul said the film was \"a winning blend\" of Chinese culture and the Marvel formula that avoided Asian stereotypes and called out some of Marvel's past \"racial errors\".[102] Francesca Rivera at IGN felt the film had successfully balanced the \"real-life complicated conflict between first-gen Asian American children and the wishes of their immigrant parents\" with the needs of an MCU film.[197]\n\nAlexis Nedd said Liu was \"flawless\" as Shang-Chi and compared his casting to that of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man and Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America in the MCU.[198] Jake Cole of Slant Magazine was more critical, giving the film 1.5 out of 4 stars and criticizing Liu's performance as being \"curiously affectless\". Cole also criticized the film's flashbacks which he felt slowed the overall story down, but praised Leung as \"effortlessly convey[ing] the calm malice with which Wenwu asserts his absolute power as well as the anguish that the man feels over the loss of his wife\".[199] Allen said Leung was the film's most brilliant casting,[8] and Han praised his performance for bringing sincerity to Wenwu which made him a \"supervillain with a soul\".[196] Katie Rife at The A.V. Club said Leung \"exudes the type of movie-star charisma critics sometimes complain is on the decline\". Rife felt Leung was not being challenged by the material in the film but was still able to bring emotional depth to Wenwu.[200] Sirikul praised the performances of Liu, Awkwafina, and Leung, but felt some of the character arcs were undermined by the film's convoluted story and rushed ending.[102] Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt highlighted Zhang, who she felt deserved her own spin-off, and Awkwafina.[201]\n\nRivera praised the film's action sequences as the best of the MCU so far, focusing on the choreography and cinematography and particularly highlighting the wuxia-style fight between Wenwu and Li at the start of the film, but criticized the digital backgrounds in Ta Lo.[197] Wenlei Ma at News.com.au also said the film's action had some of the best choreography of the MCU.[202] Greenblatt praised the bus fight, fight club, and skyscraper fight sequences as \"astonishing set pieces\",[201] while Matt Goldberg at Collider also praised the action set pieces for combining classic kung-fu movie influences with MCU visual effects.[203] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle said the bus fight was \"one of the best car chases in San Francisco movie history\".[204] Allen enjoyed the various fight sequences, saying Cretton changed the height, light, reflections, and staging for each. He described the film's final act as \"such an over-the-top, giddy, rollercoaster ride that you can't help but root for it\".[8] In contrast, Cole took issue with the amount of visual effects in the action sequences and said the final act \"devolves into loud and chaotic visual nonsense\".[199] At /Film, Hoai-Tran Bui also criticized the visual effects-heavy third act but said the film had \"one of the more forgivable ones, if only because it verges on full fantasia\", and praised the wuxia moments.[205]\n\nIn December 2021, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings received the Vanguard Award at Unforgettable Gala's 19th Annual Asian American Awards, an honor previously held by The Farewell (2019).[206]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced. The specials go behind the scenes of the MCU films and television series with cast members and additional creatives.[231] A special for this film, \"The Making of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\", goes behind the scenes of the making of the film and was released on Disney+ on November 12, 2021.[232]\n\nBy December 2021, development on a sequel had begun with Cretton returning to write and direct.[233] Liu was also expected to return as Shang-Chi by the following month. He wanted the sequel to explore what his character would do with the \"newfound power\" of the ten rings, as well as how he fits into the larger MCU.[234] Liu said in July 2023 that he was unsure when the film would be made.[235] By that November, Cretton stepped down as director of the planned film Avengers: The Kang Dynasty to focus on his commitments to other MCU projects, including the Shang-Chi sequel.[236] Filming was reported in April 2024 to be scheduled to begin in March 2025.[237][third-party source needed] Later that month, Liu confirmed that the film was in development when responding to fans who were concerned about the lack of news on the sequel.[238]\n"

        "content": "\n\nEternals is a 2021 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics race the Eternals. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 26th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Chloé Zhao, who wrote the screenplay with Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo. It stars an ensemble cast including Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Kit Harington, Salma Hayek, and Angelina Jolie. In the film, the Eternals, immortal alien beings, emerge from hiding after thousands of years to protect Earth from their ancient counterparts, the Deviants.\n\nIn April 2018, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige announced that a film based on the Eternals was in development and would explore the group as ancient aliens living throughout human history. Ryan and Kaz Firpo were hired to write the script, and Zhao was set to direct in September. She was given significant creative freedom to rewrite the script, taking particular inspiration from Terrence Malick's films, and to use more locations and natural lighting than previous MCU films had. Casting began in early 2019 and Burleigh joined to work on the script ahead of principal photography, which took place from July 2019 to February 2020 at Pinewood Studios and on location in England and the Canary Islands.\n\nEternals premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on October 18, 2021, and was released in the United States on November 5 as part of Phase Four of the MCU. The film grossed $402 million worldwide and received some awards and nominations, but it also became the first MCU film to not receive generally positive reviews. Particular criticism went to the screenplay and pacing, with commentators feeling it did not live up to Zhao's previous work or to previous MCU films. It received some praise for its themes and visuals.\n\nIn 5000 BC, ten superpowered beings known as Eternals—Ajak, Sersi, Ikaris, Kingo, Sprite, Phastos, Makkari, Druig, Gilgamesh, and Thena—are sent to Earth by Arishem, a Celestial, on the starship Domo. They are charged with exterminating invasive entities known as the Deviants. After the last Deviants are killed in 1521, the group's opinions differ over their continued relationship with humankind. Over the next 500 years, they mostly live apart, waiting for Arishem's orders.\n\nIn the present, Sersi and Sprite live together in London. After Sersi's partner Ikaris left her without explanation centuries earlier, she is now in a relationship with human Dane Whitman who works at the Natural History Museum. When the trio is attacked by the Deviant Kro, Ikaris arrives and chases the creature away. The three Eternals travel to South Dakota to reunite with their leader, Ajak, only to find her dead. Sersi is posthumously chosen by Ajak as her successor, granting her the ability to communicate with Arishem.\n\nSersi learns that the Eternals' mission was actually to prepare Earth for the Emergence of a new Celestial. Arishem explains that, for millions of years, he has been planting Celestial seeds inside planets where the energy from large populations allows new Celestials to be born. The Deviants were sent to destroy the apex predators of each planet to ensure the development of intelligent life, but when they evolved and began hunting the planets' native populations, Arishem created the Eternals to counter them. With the recent end of the Blip restoring Earth's population,[b] humankind has reached the necessary size to allow the Celestial Tiamut to be born, which will result in Earth's destruction.\n\nHoping to delay the Emergence, the Eternals reunite. At Druig's residence in the Amazon rainforest, they are attacked by the Deviants. They kill them all except for Kro, who kills Gilgamesh before fleeing. Phastos proposes they use the Uni-Mind, a connection between all the Eternals that would give Druig enough power to put Tiamut to sleep with his mind-control abilities. However, Ikaris is loyal to Arishem and refuses to help stop the Emergence. He reveals that Ajak wanted to stop the Emergence and save humanity, so he led her to the Deviants and allowed them to kill her. Sprite joins Ikaris due to her unrequited love for him while Kingo chooses to leave.\n\nMakkari locates the place of the Emergence, an active volcano in the Indian Ocean, where Ikaris and Sprite attempt to stop them. Druig knocks out Sprite, and Phastos restrains Ikaris. Kro arrives and is killed by Thena. Druig is unable to put Tiamut to sleep, and Sersi instead attempts to turn him into marble. Ikaris breaks free of his restraints and goes to kill Sersi, but is unable to due to his love for her. Both he and Sprite join with the others in the Uni-Mind, and Sersi gains enough power to turn Tiamut into marble. Guilt-ridden, Ikaris flies into the Sun. Sersi uses the remaining Uni-Mind energy to turn Sprite into a human, ending her permanent childlike state.\n\nThena, Druig, and Makkari depart on the Domo to warn Eternals on other planets of the Emergences. Whitman professes his love for Sersi and is about to reveal a secret about his family history when she, Phastos, and Kingo are lifted into space by Arishem. Displeased with their treason, Arishem says he will spare humanity if the Eternals' memories show that humans are worthy of living. He vows to return for judgment and takes the trio into a singularity.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Thena, Makkari, and Druig meet the Eternal Eros and his assistant Pip the Troll. In a post-credits scene, an unseen person[c] questions whether Whitman is ready to wield the Ebony Blade.\n\nAdditionally, Bill Skarsgård provides the voice of Kro, one of the Deviants,[21] and David Kaye voices the Celestial Arishem.[22] Harish Patel appears as Karun Patel, Kingo's human valet;[23] Haaz Sleiman and Esai Daniel Cross respectively portray Phastos's husband Ben and son Jack;[24] and Zain Al Rafeea plays a villager who comes across the Eternals when they first arrive on Earth.[25] Harry Styles appears in the mid-credits scene as Eros / Starfox, the brother of MCU character Thanos, while Patton Oswalt voices Eros's assistant Pip the Troll.[26] Mahershala Ali has an uncredited voice-only cameo as Blade in the post-credits scene ahead of starring in his own film.[7]\n\nIn April 2015, Marvel Television was working with screenwriter John Ridley to craft a new television series for ABC, \"reinventing\" an existing Marvel character or property,[27] which was revealed years later to be the Eternals.[28] Through its development, which ultimately had eventually been abandoned during the folding of Marvel Television in December 2019,[29][28] Ridley stated that he was trying to make a superhero television series that viewers had not necessarily seen before, with hopes that it could occupy \"a space that [was] not currently being filled\" by Marvel.[30] His approach to the characters would have been \"a really weird story\", though he stated the characters are \"a really hard property\" to adapt while conceding that while he believed his series would have been good it may not have been entertaining for everyone.[28]\n\nMarvel Studios president Kevin Feige said in April 2018 that the studio was actively developing a film based on the Marvel Comics series Eternals, created by Jack Kirby, to be released as part of their Phase Four slate of films. Marvel Studios had met with multiple screenwriters and was believed to be focusing on the character Sersi in the film.[31] Marvel set Ryan and Kaz Firpo to write the script a month later,[32] with their outline including a love story between the characters Sersi and Ikaris.[33] In June, Feige said Marvel was interested in exploring the \"ancient aliens kind of sci-fi trope\" by having the Eternals be the inspiration for myths and legends throughout the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).[34]\n\nDuring late August, Marvel's director search for Eternals narrowed to a shortlist that included Chloé Zhao—who had also been in the running to direct Marvel's Black Widow (2021)—Nicole Kassell, Travis Knight, and the pair of Cristina Gallego and Ciro Guerra.[33] Zhao approached Marvel Studios about making the film as she had been a fan of the MCU. She wanted to work with the studio to bring her own take and world-building to the franchise,[35] and impressed them with a presentation that Feige described as fascinating, with \"reams of visuals\".[36] Zhao worked with producer Nate Moore to develop her pitch.[37] The presentation left Marvel concerned that she might take on a different big-studio project instead of Eternals, forcing them to move quickly to secure her, and Zhao was hired as director in September.[33][38] Zhao hoped to push the scope of the film further than Marvel's Avengers: Endgame (2019),[36] but also wanted it to have intimacy.[39] Zhao described the film as a melting pot of influences, from Kirby's original work, Neil Gaiman's 2006 run, previous MCU projects, Zhao's fandom of the MCU, and her love of science fiction and fantasy films and manga.[37] Speaking specifically to her love of manga, she hoped those influences would create a \"marriage of East and West\".[36] Zhao cited the TV series Ancient Aliens, the Final Fantasy video game series, the concepts from Yuval Noah Harari's book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, and the films of Terrence Malick as her inspirations for the film.[40]\n\nMarvel considered Eternals to be a perfect transition into its next phase of films along with projects such as Captain Marvel (2019),[38] allowing the studio to cast a diverse group of actors to portray the various Eternals.[33] Moore's initial planning documents for the project including the swapping of genders, sexualities, and ethnicities of some characters from the comic books, with Zhao further advocating for this approach.[10] In February 2019, Feige reiterated that Marvel was interested in the Eternals due to Kirby's epic, century-spanning story,[41] with the film version spanning 7,000 years and exploring humanity's place in the cosmos.[37] Zhao noted that the Eternals \"have lived among us for so long, [they have] the same struggles like identity, purpose, faith, personal freedom versus greater good — all the duality and flaws that make us human\". When trying to develop a story that spanned so many years, Marvel realized that the characters would likely be a family unit, with a friendship that would \"turn into frenemies, and then turn into enemies, and then come back to friendship\". Zhao also looked to the Earth as an eleventh character in the film, chronicling its journey alongside the Eternal characters.[9] Marvel also wanted to create more ensemble films that were not crossover films, like Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), while introducing relatively unknown characters to audiences as they did with that film's title characters and the Avengers.[41]\n\n\"I wanted it to reflect the world we live in. But also I wanted to put a cast together that feels like a group of misfits. I didn't want the jocks. I want you to walk away at the end of the movie not thinking, 'This person is this ethnicity, that person is that nationality.' No. I want you to walk away thinking, 'That's a family.' You don't think about what they represent.\"\n\nThroughout early 2019, Zhao began working on a draft of the script, building upon the multiple drafts submitted by the Firpos. Approximately four months ahead of filming, the script was not finalized, so Moore introduced Patrick Burleigh, who had been part of Marvel's writers program, to Zhao in the hopes he could assist with the writing. Zhao hired him to work on the screenplay, which he did for about three months ahead of filming. Burleigh believed Zhao needed to write on the film as well as direct to \"process the film through her own filter\", and noted her draft showed she was \"trying to make the Terrence Malick version of a Marvel film\"; Zhao citing his film The Tree of Life (2011) as an inspiration. Burleigh called his work with Zhao on the script mostly \"structural\" to find \"the flow of the film\", likening the story to a road trip film.[42]\n\nAngelina Jolie joined the cast in March 2019, reportedly as Sersi,[43][44] with Kumail Nanjiani and Don Lee cast in undisclosed roles the next month.[44][45] At that time, the film was expected to feature Marvel Studios' first gay superhero.[46] In May, Richard Madden entered negotiations for the role of Ikaris,[47] and Salma Hayek had entered early negotiations for an undisclosed role the following month.[48] In July, Variety reported that the cast included Jolie, Madden, and Millie Bobby Brown, but Brown denied that she had been cast.[49][50]\n\nAt the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige officially announced The Eternals with a release date of November 6, 2020. He officially announced the casting of Jolie as Thena, Nanjiani as Kingo, Lee as Gilgamesh, Madden as Ikaris, and Hayek as Ajak, along with Lauren Ridloff as Makkari, Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, and Lia McHugh as Sprite.[51] Zhao looked for actors for each role that could \"find a bit of themselves in their character\".[9] Feige added that one of these actors was portraying an LGBTQ character,[52] with actor Haaz Sleiman later revealing that Phastos is depicted as gay in the film. Sleiman portrays the character's husband, and the pair have a child in the film. Sleiman felt it was important to depict \"how loving and beautiful a queer family can be\" rather than the \"sexual or rebellious\" depiction in some previous media.[18] Feige said the relationship was \"always sort of inherent in the story\" and he felt it was \"extremely well done\" in the film,[36] while Sleiman said it was a \"thoughtful\" depiction.[53]\n\nEternals is set around eight months after the events of Avengers: Endgame,[54] and addresses why the Eternals did not interfere in any previous conflicts in the MCU. Both Feige and Moore said the film would have \"major ripple effects\" on the future of the MCU, and at times, it was \"a challenge\" to balance the grounded nature of the MCU with the \"mythic grandeur\" of the Eternals property.[9]\n\nBy the time of the film's official announcement in July 2019, principal photography had begun at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England.[55][56] Ben Davis served as director of photography, after doing so on several previous MCU films.[10][57] Zhao said Marvel Studios allowed her creative freedom to shoot the film on location, \"exactly the way [she] wanted to shoot\" it. She was able to use a similar style to her previous films, including 360° shots and working with the same camera and rigs as were used for her film Nomadland (2020),[36] which Zhao was set to complete back-to-back with Eternals.[37] Zhao felt that she \"got lucky in that Marvel wants to take risks and do something different.\"[36] Zhao cited The Revenant (2015) as a primary influence when composing the film's action sequences.[58]\n\nGemma Chan and Barry Keoghan were in talks to join the cast in August 2019.[59][60] Chan previously portrayed Minn-Erva in Captain Marvel, but reports noted that she was potentially being looked at by Marvel to play a separate character in this film.[59] Since Minn-Erva dies in that film, Chan had felt that it was unlikely she would return to the MCU, but after working on the film she was told by Feige that the studio wanted to \"make better use\" of her in a future project. This led to Chan auditioning for Sersi, one of the last actresses to be considered for the role. Chan later described Sersi as the most difficult role for the film to cast.[61] Chan and Keoghan were confirmed to be cast in the film at the D23 Expo in August, in the roles of Sersi and Druig, respectively, along with Kit Harington as Dane Whitman.[62] Chan said she and Marvel Studios were surprised by how soon after Captain Marvel her new MCU role came, with both assuming that it would have been a project further in the future.[61] Harish Patel was cast at the end of August as Karun, Kingo's manager,[63][64] and filmed his role from September 2019 until January 2020.[63]\n\nBy early November, filming had taken place in the Canary Islands. The cast and crew, including Jolie and Madden, had to be evacuated from a shooting location on the island of Fuerteventura when an explosive device, thought to be a remnant armament from a Nazi base, was found there.[65] Later that month, Zain Al Rafeea joined the cast.[25][66] In early January 2020, filming took place outside the Oxford University Museum of Natural History in Oxford, England,[67] as well as Hampstead Heath and in Camden in London,[68][69] under the working title Sack Lunch.[69][70] Chan said the filming process felt very different from what she experienced on Captain Marvel, explaining that Eternals shot more on location and utilized natural light while Captain Marvel had more studio work and bluescreens.[61] Filming wrapped on February 4, 2020.[71]\n\nIn March 2020, Scanline VFX, one of the companies working on the film's visual effects, confirmed that they would be working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[72] Industrial Light & Magic, Luma Pictures, RISE, and Weta Digital also worked on the film's visual effects.[73] In early April, Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the pandemic, moving The Eternals' release date to February 12, 2021.[74] In August, the film's title was officially shortened from The Eternals to Eternals,[75] and the next month, the release date was pushed back to November 5, 2021.[76] Reshoots had taken place by mid-November 2020.[77]\n\nAdditional filming occurred in Los Angeles in early February, also under the working title Sack Lunch.[78] Dylan Tichenor and Craig Wood serve as co-editors of the film.[37] Tichenor said Zhao usually edits her own films and has \"strong opinions\", but on Eternals she was relying on Tichenor and Wood due to the size of the production and the ongoing awards season for Nomadland. Tichenor added that Zhao respected the pair's editing experience and point of view, and they made their first cut of the film without much input from her. They began adjusting the film based on Zhao's feedback and were still working on the editing in April 2021.[79] At the end of the month, Zhao said editing for the film was in its \"final stretch\",[37] and Jashaun St. John was revealed to appear in the film, after previously starring in Zhao's film Songs My Brothers Taught Me (2015).[80]\n\nAt the end of May 2021, with the release of the first teaser trailer and poster for the film, the official writing credits were revealed: Zhao was credited as the screenwriter, both as a solo contributor and as part of a writing team with Burleigh, while Ryan and Kaz Firpo received story credit.[1][81] Additionally, Gil Birmingham was revealed to have been cast in the film,[82] although he was absent in the final film.[citation needed] In July 2021, Writers Guild of America West presented the film's final writing credits, awarding Ryan and Kaz Firpo screenplay credit along with Zhao and the team of Zhao and Burleigh, in addition to their story credit.[2][42] Moore believed the studio had \"bit off as much as we could chew\" with the film, creating one that \"felt urgent and present and had [a fast] pace, but also took time to reflect back over the centuries\".[9]\n\nAt the film's world premiere, Matt Donnelly of Variety tweeted that Harry Styles made an appearance in a post-credits scene as Eros, Thanos' brother in the comics, which was not shown in early press screenings of the film.[83] Zhao later revealed that she \"kept tabs on [Styles]\" since his appearance in Dunkirk (2017), believing that he \"makes me think of Eros as a character\".[84] WWE wrestler Becky Lynch had a role in the film for a planned post-credits scene that was intended to set up a future project. The scene was removed for being reportedly \"too depressing\".[85]\n\nRamin Djawadi composed the score for the film, after previously doing so for Marvel's Iron Man (2008).[86] Two songs from the film's soundtrack, \"Across the Oceans of Time\" and \"Eternals Theme\", were released as singles on October 22, 2021, while the full album was released on November 3.[87][88]\n\nThe first footage of the film was released in May 2021, as part of a promotional video from Marvel Studios celebrating their films and a return to theaters in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.[89][90] Though the footage was limited and \"vague\", Hoai-Tran Bui at /Film still felt it was \"very exciting\".[91] Chaim Gartenberg of The Verge felt one of the biggest moments of the footage was seeing Jolie wielding a sword made of light. He was also encouraged that Eternals appeared to be one of Marvel's first films to \"deliver on [their] years-long promise of creating films with more diverse casts\".[89] Nerdist's Michael Arbeiter said the footage was quick, but felt that it \"manages an air of wonderment\".[90]\n\nThe first teaser for the film was released on May 24, 2021. Gartenberg felt the teaser was light on plot elements, with it instead focusing on the \"civilization-spanning scope of the superhero team and its members throughout human history\". He also believed the film was \"a big swing\" from Marvel Studios to entice audiences with a lesser-known comics property, but believed that it would succeed due to its diverse cast of well-known actors and Zhao's status as \"one of the most exciting directors around\".[92] io9's Charlies Pulliam-Moore felt the trailer was a \"multiple millennia-spanning recap of Earth's history\", and said it was unclear how much the larger MCU would impact on the film outside of a brief reference to the Avengers at the end of the trailer.[93] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Nick Romano felt the teaser was a combination of \"thrilling, goosebump-inducing moments\" and some jokes.[94] Erik Adams of The A.V. Club felt the spot teased some fresh angles for the MCU in a similar way to Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and he enjoyed the images of Kingo's Bollywood dance, Sprite performing karaoke, and the end scene of the Eternals eating together and joking about the Avengers.[95] After seeing the teaser, Variety's Adam B. Vary described the film as \"unquestionably a Chloé Zhao movie\", but wished more action set pieces were featured in the teaser to see how Zhao would approach them in the film.[1] Adele Ankers of IGN discussed the poster that was released at the same time as the trailer, highlighting how the Eternals appear in silhouette against a sunlit background which she described as \"another taste of Chloé Zhao's signature filming style and the use of natural light to illuminate a frame\" that would be seen in the film.[96] Upon release, the teaser quickly became the number one trending video on YouTube and amassed 77 million global views in its first 24 hours.[97] Disney's president of marketing Asad Ayaz said the teaser was designed to just be an introduction to the characters and tone and not give much of the film away, adding the marketing team would be \"very judicious\" on when more material would be revealed, while also using the releases of Black Widow and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings before Eternals to help expose audiences to the characters.[98]\n\nThe final trailer was released in August 2021, with Ethan Shanfeld and Manori Ravindran of Variety feeling it was \"more serious in tone\" than the teaser with the Eternals \"grappling with the prospect of emerging after centuries living apart in order to help humans\".[99] Entertainment Weekly's Devan Coggan felt that the trailer was the \"best glimpse yet\" of the film and gave a \"sense of the vast scale and scope of the film\", while answering \"one important question\" about the absence of the Eternals during the conflict against Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.[100] Aaron Couch at The Hollywood Reporter said the trailer \"reveals much of [the film's] plot as well as its characters' powers, teasing the answers to key questions about who the Eternals answer to, their relationship to Earth and why they ultimately didn't intervene\" in the conflict against Thanos.[101]\n\nIn October 2021, Lexus released a commercial promoting the film and its Lexus IS 500 sports sedan starring Nanjiani as Kingo, with frequent MCU directors Joe and Anthony Russo guiding its development and Framestore working on the visual effects.[102] Lexus created ten concept cars based on the ten Eternals characters from the film.[103] The LS 500h and NX are featured in the film.[102] Beginning on November 20, 2021, select costumes from the film were part of the Futures exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution's Arts and Industries Building, which ran through July 2022. Behind-the-scenes content looking at the evolution of the film's visuals as well as an augmented reality experience were also included in the exhibit.[104]\n\nEternals had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on October 18, 2021,[105] and was screened at the Rome Film Festival on October 24.[106] The film was released theatrically in many European countries on November 3, and in the United States and the United Kingdom on November 5 in RealD 3D and 4DX.[106] In September 2021, Disney announced that the film would have an exclusive theatrical release for a minimum of 45 days.[107] Eternals was previously set for release on November 6, 2020,[108] before it was shifted to February 12, 2021,[74] and then to the November 2021 date, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[76] It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[109]\n\nIn May 2021, a Chinese state media report excluded Eternals, as well as Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, from its list of upcoming MCU films releasing, which Variety noted \"added to rumors\" that the films would not be released in China, especially since Zhao had become \"an unexpected persona non grata\" in the country after she was scrutinized by Chinese netizens over her remarks in a 2013 interview with Filmmaker magazine in which she described China as \"a place where there are lies everywhere\".[110][111][112] By September 2021, Deadline Hollywood reported it remained \"an open question\" if the Chinese government or Zhao would attempt to \"rehabilitate\" the situation, but it \"seems likely\" the film would not be released in China following the country's response to Nomadland as well as Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings likely not being released in the country either following backlash to comments made by star Simu Liu in 2017.[113]\n\nThe film was not released in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman due to the depiction of a gay couple. Theaters in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Lebanon, and Egypt were set to show an edited version of the film which is missing all the love scenes.[114]  Angelina Jolie criticized the countries' decision to ban the film, saying: \"I'm sad for [those audiences]. And I'm proud of Marvel for refusing to cut those scenes out. I still don't understand how we live in a world today where there's still [people who] would not see the family Phastos has and the beauty of that relationship and that love. How anybody is angry about it, threatened by it, doesn't approve or appreciate it is ignorant.\"[115] Lebanese actor Haaz Sleiman, who played Phastos' husband Ben in the film, also voiced the same reaction towards the matter: \"They stood their ground and said, 'Nope, we are not going to compromise the integrity of our film.' It made these Arab countries looks [sic] so ignorant and pathetic. I have no respect for those governments. They have displayed to the world that they are not only a disgrace to humanity, but to God. Hopefully this will inspire the Saudi people, the Kuwaiti people and the people in Qatar to fight back.\"[116] Marvel later agreed to cut any kind of love scenes, including the gay couple kiss for the film's release in Indonesia, which received praise from the Indonesian Film Censorship Board (LSF).[117]\n\nEternals began streaming on Disney+ on January 12, 2022, with the option to view the theatrical version of the film or an IMAX Enhanced version.[118] Audio commentary and additional bonus features for the film were added to Disney+ in March 2022.[119] It was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on February 15. The home media includes audio commentary, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and various behind-the-scenes featurettes.[120]\n\nAccording to Samba TV, Eternals was watched by 2 million U.S. households during its first five days on Disney+.[121] Eternals was also the top streaming film for viewers in the United States for the week ending January 16, 2022, according to Whip Media's TV Time.[122]\n\nEternals grossed $164.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $237.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $402.1 million.[5][6] The film's opening weekend earned $162 million globally, which was the second-largest worldwide opening weekend in the COVID-19 pandemic for a Hollywood film, of which IMAX contributed to over $13.6 million.[123]\n\nAdvanced ticket sales for Eternals were estimated to be $2.6 million in its first 24 hours, outpacing those for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings ($1.4 million) and Black Widow ($2 million) during the same time frame, while AMC Theatres had the largest first-day sales of 2021 for the film.[124] In November, Fandango reported that pre-sales for Eternals were the second-largest of 2021, behind Black Widow.[125] In October, Boxoffice Pro initially projected that the film would earn $82–102 million within its opening weekend, and around $210–280 million in total domestic box office.[126] At the end of the month, Boxoffice Pro modified their projections to $67–92 million for the film's opening weekend, and around $165–215 million in total domestic box office, due to mixed early critical reception.[127] According to Deadline Hollywood, Eternals was expected to earn $75 million within its domestic opening weekend, and around $150 million globally.[128]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Eternals earned $30.7 million on its opening day, which included $9.5 million from Thursday night previews, marking the third-largest opening day of the pandemic, behind Black Widow and Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Its opening weekend earned $71.3 million from 5.5 million theater admissions, making it the top film of the weekend.[129] IMAX accounted for over $7.6 million over the weekend. This marked the fourth-largest opening weekend of the pandemic. The domestic opening weekend gross was lower than various pre-release projections. Deadline attributed this to the film's overall mixed reception from critics and audiences.[123] In its second weekend, Eternals remained the top film, grossing over $27.5 million.[130] Eternals became the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2021 in the United States.[131]\n\nOutside of North America, Eternals earned over $90.7 million within its opening weekend from 46 markets. It was number one in nearly all of these markets. The international opening weekend gross had exceeded various pre-release projections. IMAX contributed to $6 million of the opening gross, from 58 countries. The film scored the largest opening of the pandemic in Italy, Brazil, and Hong Kong. In South Korea, Eternals earned $14.4 million, marking the largest debut for a Hollywood film amid the pandemic.[132] In Russia, the film earned an opening of $5.4 million through six days. In its second weekend, Eternals earned $48 million from 49 markets, a drop of 49%. It remained number one in many of these territories.[133] The following weekend, the film earned $22.7 million. It was the top film of the weekend internationally, remaining the top film in many territories, including all markets across Latin America, except for Mexico.[134] As of November 28, 2021, the film's largest markets were South Korea ($26.4 million), the United Kingdom ($18.7 million), France ($14.9 million), Mexico ($14.3 million), and Brazil ($11.1 million).[135]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 47% based on 417 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An ambitious superhero epic that soars as often as it strains, Eternals takes the MCU in intriguing—and occasionally confounding—new directions.\"[136] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[137] Upon release, it became the lowest-rated MCU film on both websites and the first installment to be classified as \"rotten\" on Rotten Tomatoes.[138] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest grade for an MCU film, and PostTrak reported 78% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it.[123]\n\nCharlotte O'Sullivan of the Evening Standard described the film as \"lavish\" and \"ambitious\", and praised the fight sequences as \"astounding, beautifully paced and crammed with detail\".[139] Robert Abele of TheWrap commended the cinematography and felt \"an earnestness to the operatic stakes\".[140] Oliver Jones of the Observer called it \"full of wonder and romance and fueled by an agenda and audacity all its own\".[141] Owen Gleiberman was disappointed over Zhao's missing filmmaking style that shaped her films The Rider (2017) and Nomadland (2020) to \"embrace the straight-up expository conventionality of Marvel filmmaking\", but felt that the film was a \"squarely fun and gratifying watch\".[142] Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times thought \"it's got some pretty slow spots midfilm and it's desperately in need of a bit more wit ... what it does have is a palpable, artful mood; this is a movie full of superheroes who spend time thinking and feeling, and of special effects that aren't just zippy but often delicately elegant\".[143]\n\nLinda Marric of The Jewish Chronicle described it as \"a mishmash of well-meaning, yet jarringly verbose and bafflingly incoherent nonsense which is only just about saved by some half decent performances\";[144] Nicholas Barber of BBC Culture called Zhao's direction \"workmanlike\";[145] and Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent said that it \"strives for the same expansive soulfulness\" as Nomadland \"but discovers there's room enough only for the occasional burst of it\".[146] Brian Truitt of USA Today praised Zhao's \"penchant for naturalistic environments\", but wrote that the narrative \"struggles to juggle its many subplots and tries to do too much\".[147] Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press criticized the dialogue and fight scenes, but praised the visual effects and Nanjiani's performance.[148] Shirley Li of The Atlantic felt that \"Zhao's delicate examination of her characters outshines Eternals' duller and more convoluted moments\".[149]\n\nRobbie Collin wrote the film was \"constantly engaged in a kind of grit-toothed authenticity theatre, going out of its way to show you it's doing all the things proper cinema does, even though none of them bring any discernible benefit\";[150] Kevin Maher felt \"a strange self-sabotaging energy at the heart\";[151] and Steve Rose of The Guardian missed \"the breezy wit of Marvel's best movies ... like coming into Avengers: Endgame cold without having seen any of the preceding installments\".[152] K. Austin Collins of Rolling Stone felt that the film was \"good at telling us where to look, at impressing us with its manufactured sense of grandeur\", but lacked \"any credible sense of what's actually worth seeing\".[153] Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times had a \"depressing realization that you've just seen one of the more interesting movies Marvel will ever make, and hopefully the least interesting one Chloé Zhao will ever make\".[154] Brian Lowry of CNN thought \"the movie's structural flaws offset its stunning visuals and strong performances\".[155] Kyle Smith of National Review was harsher, describing it as \"one of the dumbest, cheesiest, most trite, and least human\" of the MCU films.[156]\n\nThe mixed reception surprised some commentators, given the MCU's positive track record and the acclaim of Zhao's previous work. Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \"much of the criticism of Kirby's work\", which was divisive for its subject matter and relationship to the wider Marvel Universe, \"has followed Zhao in her adaptation.\" He compared the divisive response to that of Zack Snyder's DC Extended Universe films Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), writing that they and Eternals share \"a deconstructive approach to superheroes and force them to question their purpose in the world, through meditative and melancholy narrative beats, and a tragic yet hopeful ending.\" This approach, he felt, subverted critics and audiences' expectations, which made them review the film more harshly.[157] Zhao addressed some of the criticisms of the film, believing some of the divisiveness came from everyone \"having an existential crisis\" because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the film being an \"existential crisis, both for humanity and God\". She also felt the reactions to how the film incorporated her filmmaking sensibilities with Marvel's were \"a testament to how much we had merged with each other; how uncomfortable that might make people feel\".[158]\n\nThe film was given the Seal of Authentic Representation from the Ruderman Family Foundation for Ridloff's role as Makkari. The seal is given to films and series that feature actors with disabilities who have at least five lines of dialogue.[159] Eternals was also one of 28 films that received the ReFrame Stamp for 2021, awarded by the gender equity coalition ReFrame for films that are proven to have gender-balanced hiring.[160]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced.[173] The special on this film, \"The Making of Eternals\", was released on Disney+ on February 16, 2022.[174]\n\nIn October 2021, Zhao said she was open to making a sequel.[175] The next month, Kaz and Ryan Firpo expressed interest in making a prequel series for Disney+ that would focus on one Eternal in a different time period each episode, such as an episode about Thena in Ancient Greece and one about Kingo in 1890s Mumbai where he balances his life as a film star with Mahatma Gandhi's campaign for India's independence from British rule. They also felt there were opportunities to continue the film's story by further exploring Dane Whitman and showing the Eternals confronting the Celestials.[176] Chan said in January 2022 that she would reprise the role of Sersi in the future.[177] Feige was asked about Styles's future in the MCU that July and said Marvel Studios was excited to further explore the characters Eros and Pip as part of the MCU's more cosmic stories.[178] A month later, Oswalt said a sequel had been confirmed by Marvel Studios and Zhao was returning to direct. He hoped it would further explore Eros and Pip, and expressed interest in a spin-off film for the characters.[179] In October, Moore said Marvel intended to bring back the Eternals characters in the future of the MCU.[180] Nanjiani said the following month that he was unaware of a sequel and believed Oswalt was mistaken, but expressed interest in reprising his role as Kingo.[181] Don Lee's talent agency indicated in December that he would reprise his role as Gilgamesh in an Eternals sequel.[182] Oswalt clarified his statements in February 2023, saying a sequel was not in development at that time and that he had been misled.[183] In July 2024, Feige said there were no plans for a sequel at the time.[184]\n"

        "content": "\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home is a 2021 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. It stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei, Andrew Garfield, and Tobey Maguire. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) to use magic to make his identity as Spider-Man a secret again after it was revealed to the world at the end of Far From Home. When the spell goes wrong because of Parker's actions, the multiverse is broken open and several visitors from alternate realities are brought into Parker's universe.\n\nA third MCU Spider-Man film was planned during the production of Homecoming in 2017. Negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal—in which they produce the Spider-Man films together—ended with Marvel Studios leaving the project in August 2019, but a negative fan reaction led to a new deal between the companies a month later. Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return, and filming took place from October 2020 to March 2021 in New York City and Atlanta. No Way Home serves as a crossover between the MCU and the previous Spider-Man films directed by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb. Several actors reprise their roles from those films, including previous Spider-Man actors Maguire and Garfield. The pair's involvement was the subject of wide speculation and numerous leaks despite Sony, Marvel, and the cast's efforts to conceal their involvement until the film's release.\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home premiered at the Fox Village Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on December 13, 2021, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 17, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $1.952 billion worldwide, surpassing its predecessor as the highest-grossing film released by Sony Pictures. It became the highest-grossing film of 2021, the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing Spider-Man film, and set several other box office records, including those for films released during the COVID-19 pandemic. The film received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 94th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. An extended version of the film, subtitled The More Fun Stuff Version, had a global theatrical release in September 2022. A sequel is scheduled for release in July 2026.\n\nAfter Quentin Beck frames Peter Parker for his murder and reveals that Peter is Spider-Man,[a] the Department of Damage Control interrogates Peter; his girlfriend, Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson; his best friend, Ned Leeds; and his aunt, May Parker. Lawyer Matt Murdock gets Peter's charges dropped, but the group grapples with negative publicity. After Peter's, MJ's, and Ned's MIT applications are rejected, Peter goes to the New York Sanctum to ask Dr. Stephen Strange for help. Strange starts casting a spell that would make everyone forget Peter is Spider-Man, but it is corrupted when Peter repeatedly requests alterations to let his loved ones retain their memories. Strange contains the corrupted spell.\n\nAt Strange's suggestion, Peter tries to convince an MIT administrator to reconsider MJ's and Ned's applications. He is attacked by Otto Octavius, who rips nanotechnology from Peter's Iron Spider suit. This bonds with Octavius's mechanical tentacles and allows Peter to take control of them. As Norman Osborn arrives and attacks, Strange teleports Peter back to the Sanctum and locks Octavius in a cell next to Curt Connors. Strange explains that the corrupted spell summoned people from other universes within the multiverse who know Spider-Man's identity. He orders Peter, MJ, and Ned to find and capture the others; they locate and retrieve Max Dillon and Flint Marko at a military research facility.\n\nOsborn reclaims control of himself from his split Green Goblin personality and destroys the Goblin mask. He gets help from May until Peter retrieves him. While discussing their battles with Spider-Man, Osborn, Octavius, and Dillon realize they were pulled from their universes just before their deaths.[b] Strange prepares to reverse the contained spell and send the villains back to their respective universes, but Peter argues that they should first help each villain to possibly change their fates upon their return. When Strange refuses, Peter steals the spell, traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and takes the villains to Happy Hogan's apartment. He uses Stark Industries technology to cure Octavius. Before Peter can cure anyone else, his Spider-Sense is triggered and he realizes that the Goblin persona has retaken control of Osborn. Goblin convinces the other villains to betray Peter and fatally wounds May as Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape; before she dies, May tells Peter that \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\".\n\nNed discovers that he can create portals using Strange's sling ring, which he and MJ use to try to locate Peter. They instead find alternate versions of Peter who were also summoned from the villains' universes by Strange's spell and are nicknamed \"Peter-Two\" and \"Peter-Three\". The group finds this universe's Peter, nicknamed \"Peter-One\", who is mourning May and ready to send the villains home to die. The alternate Peters share stories of losing loved ones and encourage Peter-One to fight in May's honor. The three Peters develop cures for the villains and lure them to the Statue of Liberty. Peter-One and Peter-Two cure Connors and Marko while Octavius helps cure Dillon. Ned accidentally frees Strange from the Mirror Dimension. The Goblin unleashes the contained spell, breaking the barriers between universes and pulling in countless others who know Peter's identity. Strange attempts to hold them off while an enraged Peter-One tries to kill the Goblin. Peter-Two stops him but gets stabbed by the Goblin. Peter-Three helps Peter-One inject the Goblin with his cure, restoring Osborn's sanity.\n\nPeter-One realizes that the only way to protect the multiverse is to erase himself from everyone's memory and requests Strange do so while promising MJ and Ned that he will find them and remind them who he is. Strange reluctantly casts the spell, and everyone returns to their respective universes—including Eddie Brock,[c] who unknowingly leaves behind a piece of the Venom symbiote. Two weeks later, Peter visits MJ to reintroduce himself to her and Ned, but he decides against it. While mourning at May's grave, he has a conversation with Hogan and is inspired to carry on, making a new Spider-Man suit and resuming his vigilantism in New York City.\n\nRhys Ifans reprises his role as Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard, an Oscorp scientist from Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) who transformed into a large reptilian monster while trying to regrow his missing arm. Thomas Haden Church reprises his role as Flint Marko / Sandman, a small-time thief from Raimi's Spider-Man 3 who received an ability to transform into sand.[22] Both Ifans and Church returned to voice the characters, though footage at the end of the film when they revert to their human forms was archival footage from The Amazing Spider-Man and Spider-Man 3, respectively.[39] Watts served as a stand-in for Church on-set by providing motion-capture reference to the uncredited body double who physically replaced Church in the role.[40] Charlie Cox reprises his role as Matt Murdock from Marvel Television's Netflix series,[41] and Tom Hardy reprises his roles as Eddie Brock / Venom from Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) in an uncredited cameo appearance in the mid-credits scene.[42]\n\nReprising their roles from previous MCU Spider-Man films are Angourie Rice as Betty Brant, Parker's classmate and Ned's ex-girlfriend;[43] Hannibal Buress as Coach Wilson, Midtown School of Science and Technology's gym teacher;[44] Martin Starr as Roger Harrington, Parker's academic decathlon teacher;[45] J. B. Smoove as Julius Dell, Parker's teacher;[46] J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the host of The Daily Bugle;[47][48] and Gary Weeks as Department of Damage Control (DODC) agent Foster.[49] Jake Gyllenhaal appears as Quentin Beck / Mysterio via archival footage from Far From Home.[50] Also appearing in the film are Paula Newsome as an MIT administrator,[45] Arian Moayed as DODC agent Cleary,[50] Mary Rivera as Ned's grandmother,[45] and Cristo Fernández as a bartender serving Brock.[42] Tom Holland's brother Harry Holland was set to make a cameo as a thief, but his scenes were cut from the original theatrical release.[51] Lexi Rabe, who portrayed Stark's daughter Morgan in Avengers: Endgame (2019), also had an appearance that was not included in the theatrical release.[52]\n\nDuring production on Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), two sequels were being planned by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures.[53] In June 2017, star Tom Holland explained that each film would take place during a different year of high school for Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the third being set during the character's senior year.[54] Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige noted in July 2019 that the third film would feature \"a Peter Parker story that has never been done before on film\" due to the ending of the second film, Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), which publicly reveals that Parker is Spider-Man.[55]\n\nDevelopment on third and fourth MCU Spider-Man films had begun by August 2019, with Sony hoping Holland and director Jon Watts would return for both;[56] Holland was contracted to return for one more film, while Watts had completed his two-film deal and would need to sign on for any more films.[57][58] By then, Marvel Studios and its parent company The Walt Disney Studios had spent several months discussing expanding their deal with Sony. The existing deal had Marvel and Feige produce the Spider-Man films for Sony and receive 5% of their revenue. Sony wanted to expand the deal to include more films while keeping the same terms of the original agreement. Disney expressed concern with Feige's workload producing the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchise already and asked for a 25–50% stake in any future films Feige produced for Sony.[56][59][58] Unable to come to an agreement, Sony announced that it would be moving forward on the next Spider-Man film without Feige or Marvel's involvement. Their statement acknowledged that this could change in the future, thanked Feige for his work on the first two films, and said they appreciated \"the path [Feige] has helped put us on, which we will continue.\"[59] Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers were writing the screenplay for the third film by the time of Sony's announcement, after also doing so for Far From Home, but Watts was receiving offers to direct large films for other studios instead of returning to the franchise, including potentially working on a different property for Marvel Studios and Feige.[58]\n\nIn September 2019, Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman Tony Vinciquerra said that \"for the moment the door is closed\" on Spider-Man returning to the MCU and confirmed that the character would be integrated with Sony's own shared universe—Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU)—moving forward. Responding to backlash from fans following the announcement, Vinciquerra added that \"the Marvel people are terrific people, we have great respect for them, but on the other hand we have some pretty terrific people of our own. [Feige] didn't do all the work ... we're pretty capable of doing what we have to do here.\"[60] However, after this fan reaction continued at Disney's biennial convention D23, and at the urging of Holland who personally spoke to Disney CEO Bob Iger and Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group chairman Tom Rothman,[61] the companies returned to negotiations.[62] Sony and Disney announced a new agreement at the end of September which would allow Marvel Studios and Feige to produce another MCU Spider-Man film for Sony with Amy Pascal, scheduled for July 16, 2021.[5] Disney was reportedly co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of its profits, while retaining the character's merchandising rights.[5][62] Feige said he was \"thrilled\" that the character would remain in the MCU and said \"all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working\" on the franchise. The agreement also allowed Holland's Spider-Man to appear in a future Marvel Studios film as well as crossing over to Sony's own shared universe,[5] with the latter interaction described as \"a 'call and answer' between the two franchises as they acknowledge details between the two in what would loosely be described as a shared detailed universe\". Sony described their previous films with Marvel Studios as a \"great collaboration\", and said \"our mutual desire to continue was equal to that of the many fans.\"[62] At the time of the new agreement, Watts was in final negotiations to direct the film.[63]\n\nDiscussing the new deal in early October, Iger attributed it to the efforts of Holland as well as the fan response to the end of the original deal. He felt that both Sony and Disney had initially forgotten that \"there are other people who actually matter\" while they were negotiating.[64] Rothman said the deal was a \"win-win-win. A win for Sony, a win for Disney, a win for the fans.\" He felt the initial reports on the negotiations did not necessarily line up with the actual discussions that were taking place, and said the final deal would have eventuated without the reports and fan discourse.[65] By the middle of the month, Zendaya was confirmed to be reprising her role as Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson from the previous films in the sequel.[9][10]\n\nMcKenna and Sommers began working on the script in earnest by December 2019.[31][16] They considered featuring Kraven the Hunter as the film's main antagonist,[31] an idea that Watts had expressed interest in and pitched to Holland,[66][67] but was abandoned because Sony wanted to first feature the character in a solo film before any other projects.[68] The plot subsequently gravitated towards a story idea similar to It's a Wonderful Life (1946) in which Parker makes a wish regarding his now public identity. That idea introduced Dr. Stephen Strange to the story, and the duo began exploring the idea of the multiverse and potentially revisiting characters from past Spider-Man films. Initially they thought this would just be a tease for fans, but they ultimately decided to fully integrate the past characters into the plot. Sommers said, \"Once it was collectively decided that we were going to take this swing, we had to commit and we had to do what was right for the story.\" They optimistically wrote for all the characters they wanted in the film before those actors were confirmed to be returning.[31] Initial drafts of the film included every major character from past Spider-Man films returning, but this was narrowed down because the pair felt they had \"bit[ten] off more than [they] could chew\". The duo worked hard to prevent the film from just being \"a bunch of fan service\" by using the returning characters to help tell Peter Parker's story instead of just creating \"curtain calls for everybody\".[16] Norman Osborn / Green Goblin from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy was not the main villain of the film in the first version of the script, despite still appearing as an antagonist; after the film lost \"other characters\", McKenna and Sommers concluded that the Green Goblin \"had to be\" the main villain and rewrote the script to give him a second chance to replicate his actions in Spider-Man (2002), but in a darker way related to Holland's version of Spider-Man.[69] America Chavez had been considered to appear in the film at one point to serve in the sorcerer's apprentice-type role that eventually became part of Ned Leeds's role in the film; she would go on to appear in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022).[70]\n\nBy the end of 2019, filming was expected to begin in mid-2020.[71] By March 2020, McKenna and Sommers were still working on the first draft of the script.[16] In April, Sony rescheduled the film's release to November 5, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[72] Although the film was originally meant to be set after the events of Multiverse of Madness, release date changes meant the film would be released first which meant aspects of the plot had to be rewritten,[73] including Strange no longer having firsthand knowledge of the multiverse. McKenna felt this made it \"even more frightening, to start fooling around with these things, because it's the fear of the unknown\".[16] In June, Marisa Tomei confirmed that she would return as May Parker along with Watts as director. She was hopeful that May's work as a community organizer would be featured in the film.[30] Also in June, Charlie Cox, who portrayed Matt Murdock / Daredevil in Marvel Television's Netflix series, was contacted by Feige about reprising his role in upcoming Marvel Studios projects starting with appearances in No Way Home and the Disney+ series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022).[74][75] While working on the script, McKenna and Sommers discussed the possibility of giving Murdock a larger role in the film than they had originally planned, though the duo ultimately decided against it to avoid shifting the film's focus away from Parker.[76] The next month, Holland said production was planned to take place from late 2020 to February 2021,[77] and Sony shifted the film's release date to December 17, 2021.[78] Tony Revolori was also confirmed to be reprising his role as Flash Thompson.[29] In early October, Jacob Batalon and Benedict Cumberbatch were set to reprise their MCU roles of Ned Leeds and Strange, while Jamie Foxx was set to return as Max Dillon / Electro from Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), with filming beginning later in the month.[17][12] Immediately prior to the beginning of filming, several other key actors in the film had yet to sign on. According to Holland, the film needed \"all or none\" of the actors to be produced.[73]\n\nSecond unit filming occurred from October 14 to 16, 2020, in New York City,[79][80][81] under the working title Serenity Now,[82][80] to capture visual effects plates and establishing shots.[79] Filming occurred in the Astoria, Sunnyside, and Long Island City neighborhoods in Queens.[83][81] On October 23, filming occurred in Greenwich Village in Manhattan.[84]\n\nThe production moved to Atlanta by October 25, with Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya joining for principal photography,[85][86] after Holland finished shooting Sony's Uncharted (2022) two days earlier.[87][79][88] Mauro Fiore served as cinematographer on the film,[89] replacing Seamus McGarvey,[90] who had to leave the production after contracting COVID-19. McGarvey also had a conflict with Cyrano (2021) following the film's pandemic-caused production delay,[91] as principal photography was originally planned to start in July 2020.[92][93][77] Shooting in Atlanta occurred at Trilith Studios, with strict safety measures in place on the soundstages to prevent exposure to COVID-19.[94] To reduce interactions between cast and crew members on set during the pandemic, the production reportedly relied on \"innovative new technology\" that scanned actors into a visual effects system that can apply make-up and costumes to actors during post-production.[95] A light system was also in-place to signal when the cast could take off their masks for filming and when masks would be required for the cast and crew members to wear while set work was being done.[96] Cumberbatch began shooting his scenes in Atlanta by late November, before beginning work on Multiverse of Madness which began filming that month in London.[97][98] Filming ran for seven-to-eight weeks using the working titles Serenity Now and The November Project, before a break during the 2020 Christmas season.[99][88][100]\n\nBy December 2020, Alfred Molina was set to reprise his role as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 (2004),[25] with Tobey Maguire reprising his role as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Raimi's Spider-Man film trilogy and Andrew Garfield returning as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films.[31] A cameo appearance of Maguire and Garfield alongside Holland as their respective Spider-Men had previously been considered for the Sony Pictures Animation film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), but was cut then because Sony felt at that moment that it would be too risky and confusing.[101] At that time, Collider reported that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film alongside Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson from Raimi's Spider-Man film trilogy and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy from the Amazing Spider-Man films.[102] The first draft of the script included other characters from the Spider-Man and Amazing Spider-Man films, such as Sally Field's May Parker, but the writers felt that including too many characters would negatively affect the story.[16] The rumors about returning actors led to speculation and commentary, with Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter believing that a crossover-style film could \"lessen the impact\" of Sony's successful animated Into the Spider-Verse film.[103] His colleague Graeme McMillan felt a \"Spider-Verse\" crossover would allow Marvel to \"clean up some loose ends ... and fulfill some fan dreams in the process\", especially if Marvel and Sony's negotiations meant that they wanted to separate Spider-Man from the MCU.[104] /Film's Hoai-Tran Bui feared the film was becoming over-crowded and wished that Holland could lead a Spider-Man film without a \"bigger A-list star showing him the ropes\",[105] while Adam B. Vary of Variety noted that these reports were not confirmed and questioned whether the returning actors would be making more than cameo appearances.[106] Shortly after, Holland denied that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film.[88] Many of the actors returning from previous Spider-Man films were brought to set in cloaks to help prevent their involvements in the film from leaking.[107] Around Christmas 2020, McKenna and Sommers rewrote the introductions of Maguire and Garfield as well as much of the third act in time for those actors to start filming. They had not been able to focus on those scenes earlier because they were busy during filming of much of the first and second acts in the previous months.[16]\n\nFeige confirmed in December 2020 that the film would have connections to Multiverse of Madness.[108] A month later he discussed the fact that the film's title had not yet been announced, acknowledging that it was being referred to by some as Spider-Man 3 and revealing that Marvel was referring to it as Homecoming 3 internally.[109] Cox had shot material for the film by then.[41] An Atlanta set photo indicated that the film would be set during the Christmas season.[110] Filming occurred at Frederick Douglass High School from January 22 to 24.[111][112] The next month, Holland described it as \"the most ambitious standalone superhero\" film,[99] and again denied the rumors that Maguire and Garfield would appear.[113][8] At the end of February, the film's title was revealed to be Spider-Man: No Way Home, continuing the naming convention of the past two films of featuring \"home\" in the title.[114] Filming took place at Midtown High School from March 19 to 21.[111][115] The Atlanta Public Schools system had stopped allowing buildings in the district for use as filming locations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but gave this film an exception since both the Frederick Douglass and Midtown schools were previously used as filming locations in Homecoming.[111] Hannibal Buress was revealed to be reprising his role as gym teacher Coach Wilson,[115] with Buress releasing a music video in August 2021 revealing that he had filmed scenes in Atlanta.[44] Holland said No Way Home had more \"visceral\" fight sequences than the previous two films, with more hand-to-hand combat.[27] Filming wrapped on March 26, 2021.[116][117]\n\nIn April 2021, Molina confirmed that he was appearing in the film, explaining that he had been told not to talk about his role in the film during production but he realized that his appearance had been widely rumored and reported on.[26] Later that month, J. B. Smoove revealed that he was returning as Julius Dell from Far From Home,[46] while Cox stated that he was not involved with the film.[118] In early May, Garfield denied that he had been asked to appear in the film, but later said \"never say never\",[119][120] while Angourie Rice was revealed to be returning as Betty Brant in the film, reprising her role from previous MCU media.[43] Later that month, Stone denied her involvement in the film.[121]\n\nSony Pictures Group President Sanford Panitch acknowledged in May that there had been confusion and frustration from fans regarding the relationship between the SSU and the MCU but stated that there was a plan to clarify this. He believed it was already \"getting a little more clear for people [as to] where we're headed\" at that time and added that the release of No Way Home would reveal more of this plan. Vary commented that the apparent introduction of multiverse elements in No Way Home could be what would allow Holland to appear in both the MCU and the SSU.[122] The official trailer for No Way Home confirmed the involvements of Jon Favreau as Harold \"Happy\" Hogan and Benedict Wong as Wong, reprising their roles from past MCU films,[19] as well as J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson from Far From Home (Simmons previously played a different version of the character in the Raimi trilogy as well).[47] It was also confirmed that the characters Electro and Green Goblin would appear in the film,[19][20][123] with the implication that this incarnation of Green Goblin would be Willem Dafoe's version from the Raimi films.[123] In September 2021, Garfield again denied he was in the film, saying, \"No matter what I say... it's either going to be really disappointing for people or it's going to be really exciting\".[124] Garfield later described his denials as \"rather stressful but also weirdly enjoyable\".[125]\n\nIn early October, many commentators expected Tom Hardy to reprise his roles as Eddie Brock and Venom from Venom (2018) and Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021), after the Let There Be Carnage mid-credits scene showed the characters being transported from their universe (the SSU) to the MCU.[126][127][128] Feige said there was a lot of coordination between the Let There Be Carnage and No Way Home teams to create the scene,[129] which was directed by Watts during the production of No Way Home.[16] Hardy ultimately appeared as Brock in the film's mid-credits scene,[42] though there had been discussions about integrating him into the film's final battle,[16] as well as bonding Holland's Parker to a symbiote.[130] Later that month, Empire's issue on No Way Home stated that the film would include the returns of Doctor Octopus, Electro, Dafoe's Green Goblin, Thomas Haden Church's Flint Marko / Sandman from Raimi's Spider-Man 3 (2007) and Rhys Ifans's Curt Connors / Lizard from Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man (2012).[131] Church's role in the film was originally meant to be larger, counting with a subplot of his own about Sandman's relationship with his daughter Penny (who was previously portrayed by Perla Haney-Jardine), but the COVID-19 pandemic and the script being rewritten led to his role's reduction, only providing scratch dialogue and some motion-capture at a San Antonio, Texas parking lot.[132] Watts said these were still unconfirmed rumors and was in \"no hurry to confirm or deny appearances\" of the characters,[131] while Feige said the rumors were fun for fans but audiences should not expect them all to come true.[133] The film's second trailer confirmed the involvements of Dafoe, Church, and Ifans.[22] Paul Giamatti's Aleksei Sytsevich / Rhino from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Jake Gyllenhaal's Quentin Beck / Mysterio from Far From Home were also considered for inclusion, with McKenna and Sommers playing with the idea of a Sinister Six forming; Rhino, Mysterio, and the Sinister Six ultimately did not appear in the film,[134] though archival footage of Gyllenhaal as Beck from Far From Home was used in No Way Home.[50] A cameo appearance by the version of Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Insomniac Games's Spider-Man video game series was also considered for No Way Home.[130] Concept art of Doctor Octopus for No Way Home revealed that in addition to his original outfit from Spider-Man 2, there were plans for the character to wear a green-and-yellow comics-accurate costume in the film, but the idea was scrapped.[135]\n\nAt the beginning of November, Jorge Lendeborg Jr. revealed that he would be reprising his role as Jason Ionello from Homecoming and Far From Home in a similar role to those films that would have \"very little to do with the core\" story.[136] By the middle of the month, additional photography had been completed for the film.[137] Pascal described No Way Home as \"the culmination of the Homecoming trilogy\",[138] and Arian Moayed revealed that he had a role in the film,[139] playing Department of Damage Control (DODC) agent Cleary.[50] At that time, Dunst confirmed that she would not appear in the film,[140] but also stated that she would \"never say no\" to reprising her role as Mary Jane Watson.[141] In mid-December, Martin Starr was confirmed to be appearing as Roger Harrington in the film, reprising his role from previous MCU media.[45] A teaser trailer for Multiverse of Madness was included at the end of the film as a post-credits scene,[142] before being released online shortly after No Way Home's theatrical release.[143] Jeffrey Ford and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as the film's editors.[144] The visual effects were provided by Cinesite, Clear Angle Studios, Crafty Apes, Digital Domain, Folks VFX, Framestore, Luma Pictures, Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies, Mr. X, Perception, Secret Lab, Sony Pictures Imageworks, and SSVFX.[145] The scene of Holland's Parker's first confrontation with the Green Goblin in Hogan's apartment went through several different iterations, including one that featured Michael Keaton's Adrian Toomes / Vulture from Homecoming, and another in which the Goblin bombs Hogan's apartment with May still inside, presumably killing her in a different manner than how it was depicted in the final film.[146][147][130]\n\nIn November 2020, Homecoming and Far From Home composer Michael Giacchino was confirmed to be returning for No Way Home.[148][149] The film's score album was released digitally on December 17, 2021, with a track titled \"Arachnoverture\" released as a single on December 9 and another titled \"Exit Through the Lobby\" released the following day.[150] Giacchino references themes from previous Spider-Man films by Hans Zimmer, James Horner, Christopher Young,[151] and Danny Elfman, as well as his own themes from Doctor Strange (2016).[152] Regarding the use of these other themes, Giacchino did not want their use to be fan service and finding ways to include them in a \"very targeted\" way. He and Watts were \"very much in alignment in terms of when to use them and when not to use them for their maximum effect\".[153]\n\nIn May 2020, Sony entered a promotional partnership with Hyundai Motor Group to showcase their new models and technologies in the film;[154] Hyundai later released a commercial, titled \"Only Way Home\", that was directed by Watts to promote the film and the Ioniq 5 electric-powered SUV (which appears in the film along with the Hyundai Tucson), with Holland and Batalon starring.[155] In late February 2021, Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya released three stills featuring their characters from the film alongside fake logos with the titles Spider-Man: Phone Home, Spider-Man: Home-Wrecker, and Spider-Man: Home Slice, respectively.[156] The film's official title was announced the next day with a video showing Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya leaving Watts's office (where they supposedly received the fake titles). Batalon and Zendaya note that Holland could not be trusted with the actual title since he had \"accidentally\" revealed the second film's title. The video ends on a whiteboard showing the film's true title, among various other titles featuring the word \"home\" that were apparently considered.[114] Jennifer Bisset of CNET suggested the fake titles and logos could represent the villains in the film, including Foxx's Electro and Molina's Doctor Octopus,[156] while TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez called them funny \"bait-and-switch fakes\", and noted the Phone Home title referenced a line from E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).[157] Gregory Lawrence of Collider felt the Home-Wrecker title could point to the film feeling like a 1990s thriller film, and said the fake titles were a \"solid goof\" to excite fans. He also compared the stills to the \"terrifying/awe-inspiring wonder\" of Steven Spielberg films and The Goonies (1985),[158] while Germain Lussier from io9 said they gave off \"subtle National Treasure, Indiana Jones vibes\".[159] In July 2021, Marvel revealed various toys and figurines for the film, including Funko Pops, Marvel Legends figures, and Lego sets.[160]\n\nAt the end of August 2021, when asked about the lack of trailer and official images or descriptions for the film, Feige stated that the film was not being \"any more or less secret than any of our other projects\" and reaffirmed that a trailer would be released before the film's premiere in theaters.[161] Though Sony handles the marketing for the film, their marketing team is in coordination with Disney's to ensure each knows when the other is releasing MCU-related content so it is a \"win-win for everybody\".[162] On August 22, an apparent leak of the first trailer was shared on social media,[163][164][165] which The Hollywood Reporter deemed \"legitimate\" after Sony worked to have various copies of the trailer taken down.[163] Adam Chitwood at Collider noted the built up online \"fervor\" surrounding the trailer and felt that it would not be able to \"live up to the hype fans have built up in their minds\". Chitwood continued that the other 2021 film releases from Marvel Studios had not seen a similar level of demand as No Way Home, pointing out that all of the rumored castings had positioned the film to be a \"once-in-a-lifetime moviegoing experience\" if they were accurate. He also wondered if Sony was wary of committing marketing that noted the film's December 2021 release date amid the resurgence of the COVID-19 Delta variant.[166]\n\nThe film's teaser trailer was officially released on August 23 during Sony's CinemaCon 2021 panel.[20] Entertainment Weekly's Devan Coggan noted that the trailer confirmed the multiverse's role in the film, including elements from the Raimi and Webb films,[6] while Ethan Anderton from /Film called the trailer \"nothing short of thrilling\" since it confirmed many of the previous rumors about the film.[167] Austen Goslin at Polygon conversely felt much of what had been rumored did not get revealed in the trailer, feeling that the rumors were either false or Marvel was still intending to keep them a secret.[168] Anderton's colleague Joshua Meyer called the trailer \"a doozy... packed with jaw-dropping moments\" and noted how the film would be adapting the \"One More Day\" comic book storyline;[169] Newby had previously noted the apparent adaption of \"One More Day\" and \"One Moment in Time\" storylines following the reveal of Cumberbatch's casting.[103] Many commentators noted the possible teases of Spider-Man villains Sandman and the Lizard in the trailer as an indication of the Sinister Six forming in the film.[47][123][170] Vinnie Mancuso at Collider was excited to see the return of Molina and the potential for Dafoe's involvement, but called it a \"cheap pop\" since it was doing \"a disservice to the stories you're trying to tell in the present by reminding the audience how much better things used to be\". He also felt the trailer played into \"Marvel's ongoing reluctance to let Tom Holland's Spider-Man star in his own Spider-Man movies\" since the trailer gave Parker \"zero memorable moments\" among all of its elements.[171] The trailer had 355.5 million global views in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period. This surpassed the record of Avengers: Endgame (289 million views) and more than doubled the views for the Spider-Man: Far From Home trailer (135 million). It also generated the largest 24-hour social media conversation volume of all-time globally with 4.5 million mentions, made up of 2.91 million in the United States, and 1.5 million internationally; these both exceeded Avengers: Endgame's mentions (1.94 million in the United States, 1.38 million internationally).[172]\n\nThe second official trailer premiered at a fan screening at the Regal Sherman Oaks theater in Los Angeles on November 16, 2021.[173] Goslin felt the trailer \"reveals the full extent of Marvel's Spider-Man multiverse\",[174] while his colleague Matt Patches noted the missing appearance of Maguire's or Garfield's Spider-Man in the trailer but felt that it was \"entirely possible the actors appear in No Way Home\".[175] Jason Robbins of Collider was disappointed by the trailer, saying it was \"what we expected, but less\", since it just showed the returning villains and had no confirmation of Maguire or Garfield or \"further insight into the multiverse\".[48] Some commentators said parts of the trailer appeared as though Maguire and Garfield had been edited out of the footage, such as a shot in which the Lizard appears to be struck by an invisible force.[176][177] On November 24, Sony began releasing several videos on TikTok as part of their The Daily Bugle viral marketing campaign featuring Simmons and Rice.[178] In December 2021, the first minute of the film premiered exclusively on Late Night with Seth Meyers,[179] while a newsstand for The Daily Bugle was set up in New York City in partnership with Liberty Mutual to promote the film.[180] Other marketing partners include the video games Fortnite and PUBG Mobile, which featured special in-game Spider-Man themed props and costumes, Asus, whose Republic of Gamers (ROG) laptop is used by Ned in the film, Xiaomi, iQOO, Continental AG, and Tampico Beverages. The film had a total promotional marketing value of $202 million.[181]\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home had its world premiere at Fox Village Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on December 13, 2021.[182][183] The film was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on December 15,[184] and in the United States on December 17, where it opened in 4,325 theaters including in RealD 3D[185] and IMAX and other premium large formats.[186] It was previously set for release on July 16, 2021,[5] but was pushed back to November 5,[72] before it was further pushed back to the December 2021 date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[78] It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[187]\n\nIn August 2021, Sony and CJ 4DPlex announced a deal to release 15 of Sony's films over three years in the ScreenX format, including No Way Home.[188] In November 2021, the film was reported to be getting a theatrical release in China, making it the first Phase Four film to do so as Black Widow, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, and Eternals were not released in the country,[189] though as of February 2022[update], there had been no release date,[190] in part because of diplomatic tensions between the country and the United States,[191][190] which stemmed in part from the U.S. diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.[191] In May 2022, Chinese authorities had reportedly requested for the Statue of Liberty to be removed from the film for it to be released in the country, but Sony refused.[192]\n\nIn March 2024, Sony announced that all of their live-action Spider-Man films would be re-released in theaters as part of Columbia Pictures' 100th anniversary celebration. Spider-Man: No Way Home was re-released on June 3, 2024.[193]\n\nAn extended cut of the film, subtitled The More Fun Stuff Version, was announced in June 2022. The re-release celebrated 60 years of Spider-Man in comics and 20 years of Spider-Man in film,[197] and featured approximately 13 minutes of additional and deleted scenes. The additions included: an introduction by Holland, Maguire, and Garfield; additional scenes of Parker and May being interrogated by the Department of Damage Control; the scene with Holland's brother Harry as a thief that was cut from the original release; Daily Bugle reports of Parker's first day back at school and the arrivals of Dillon and Marko; additional scenes of Parker at school; Brant interviewing Parker, his teachers, and his classmates; additional scenes in the basement of the New York Sanctum; a scene featuring May, Parker, and the villains in an elevator while on the way to Hogan's apartment; an additional scene with Murdock and Hogan; additional scenes of the three Parkers; and a new post-credits scene, replacing the teaser trailer of Multiverse of Madness, which showcases the effects of Strange's second spell.[198]\n\nThe More Fun Stuff Version was released in theaters beginning August 31, 2022, in Indonesia, followed by the United States and Canada, among other countries, on September 1, and later in a number of other markets through October 6.[199][200] The poster for the extended cut was considered an improvement on the original release's marketing, since it was able to feature all of the characters who were previously kept  secret in the lead up to the film's release.[194][195][196] Shrishty Mishra at Collider said it was an \"Avengers-style poster [with] a perfect blend of multiverse feels, combined with the 'Where's Waldo' effect\".[194] Anthony Lund of MovieWeb called it an \"epic poster that [the fans] have been calling out for\".[201] ComicBook.com's Russ Burlingame said the poster was what \"we've all been waiting for\" and \"a big change in the way [Sony] initially promoted the movie\" since they \"continued to play coy\" on the cameos after the film had released.[196]\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on digital download on March 15, 2022,[202] and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on April 12. Digitally, the film was also available in a three-film bundle including all of Marvel Studios' Spider-Man films, as well as an eight-film bundle including Holland, Maguire, and Garfield's films.[203] Sony moved the digital release up to March 15 from March 22, following Blu-ray versions of the film being leaked to torrent sites.[204][202] The home media includes a gag reel and various behind-the-scenes featurettes, including two roundtable discussions: one with Dafoe, Molina, and Foxx, and another with Holland, Maguire, and Garfield.[205] It has the most pre-release digital purchases on Vudu, surpassing the purchases for Endgame. To announce the home media release dates, Sony and the film's social media accounts posted a photo of Holland, Maguire, and Garfield recreating a popular meme from the 1967 Spider-Man television series of multiple Spider-Men pointing at one another; the tweets of the image garnered more than 10,000 retweets within minutes of being posted.[206] Within its first week of release, the film sold over 2.1 million digital units in the United States, equaling $42 million; this was a record for a film's first week available on digital release.[207] It was also the highest-selling film on physical media for 2022 in the US according to The NPD Group.[208]\n\nThe film was released on Starz following its theatrical and home media releases, the last film released by Sony with an exclusive limited streaming video on demand (SVOD) release on Starz. Following films would be released on Netflix after their theatrical and home media releases, through 2026.[209][210] Additionally, Sony signed a deal with Disney in April 2021 giving the latter access to Sony's legacy content, including past Spider-Man films and Marvel content in the SSU, to stream on Disney+ and Hulu and appear on Disney's linear television networks. Disney's access to Sony's titles to be released from 2022 through 2026 would come following their availability on Netflix.[211][212] In February 2022, Sony expanded their pre-existing deal with WarnerMedia for making their films available on HBO Max and HBO across Central and Eastern Europe, which included No Way Home.[213] The More Fun Stuff Version was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on digital on October 18, 2022, as Spider-Man: No Way Home – Extended Cut,[214] when it also began streaming on Starz.[215]\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home grossed $814.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.108 billion in other territories for a worldwide total of $1.923 billion.[3][4] It is the highest-grossing film of 2021,[216] the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time,[217] the third-highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada,[218] the highest-grossing Spider-Man film, and the highest-grossing film released by Sony.[219] No Way Home is also the first film since Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) to gross over $1 billion,[220] becoming the third-fastest to reach that milestone and the first to do so during the COVID-19 pandemic.[221] It surpassed Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) to become Sony Pictures' highest-grossing film in North America.[219] Based on a final projected worldwide gross of $1.75 billion (a figure that was surpassed), Deadline Hollywood estimated the film's final net profit at $610 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs versus box office grosses and home media revenues.[222] It returned the global revenue of Cineworld, the world's second-largest cinema operator, to 88% of 2019 levels.[223]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, No Way Home earned $121.85 million (which included $50 million from its Thursday night previews) on its opening day, becoming the second-highest opening film after Endgame ($157.4 million) and the highest-opening film for a December release. In its opening weekend, it grossed $260 million, surpassing Infinity War ($257.7 million) to become the second-highest domestic box office opening of all time.[224] As of January 9, 2022[update], an estimated 54.4 million people have seen No Way Home in theaters in the United States and Canada.[225] The film remained at the top of the box office for three additional weekends until it was dethroned in its fifth weekend by Scream.[226][227][225][228] In its sixth weekend of release, No Way Home reclaimed the top spot at the box office.[229] The film once again held onto the number one spot in its seventh weekend of release.[230] In March 2022, the film surpassed $800 million in the United States and Canada, becoming the third film to do so after Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and Endgame. Comscore Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian called the film \"arguably the most important movie to the movie theater industry ever\", as it helped show the viability of the movie theater industry and the benefit of theatrical release windows while the industry recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic.[207] The film dropped to the 11th spot on its 15th weekend.[231] No Way Home returned to first place at the box office, earning $1.8 million on the first day of the release of The More Fun Stuff Version,[232] and went on to finish third with $6.5 million over the four-day Labor Day weekend, finishing behind Top Gun: Maverick (2022) and Bullet Train (2022).[233] It was the highest opening weekend box office gross for a re-released MCU film, surpassing Endgame ($5.5 million) and Far From Home ($4 million).[234]\n\nNo Way Home earned $43.6 million from 15 markets on its opening day, with Sony holding the best opening-day record in South Korea, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Italy, and Taiwan. In South Korea, the film grossed $5.28 million on its opening day, thereby beating Far From Home's opening day in the country by over 11% and the biggest day-one figure for any film during the pandemic. In the United Kingdom, the film beat No Time to Die's opening box office record at £7.6 million ($10.1 million).[235] In India, the film's box office on its opening day was ₹320 million (equivalent to ₹360 million or US$4.2 million in 2023) to ₹345 million (equivalent to ₹390 million or US$4.5 million in 2023), beating Endgame and the Indian film Sooryavanshi (2021).[236] In its five-day opening weekend, the film grossed $340.8 million from 60 markets.[237] In Latin America as of January 16, 2022, it became the all-time highest-grossing film in Mexico ($72 million), and the second all-time highest in Brazil ($50.4 million), Central America ($12.6 million) and Ecuador ($7.9 million).[238] As of February 27, 2022[update], the film's largest markets are the United Kingdom ($127.3 million), Mexico ($76.2 million), Australia ($67.9 million), France ($65.2 million), and South Korea ($63.1 million).[239]\n\nTickets went on sale the midnight of November 29, 2021, with several ticket websites such as Fandango and AMC Theatres crashing due to the high influx of users attempting to purchase tickets.[240] Ticket sales on Fandango surpassed those for Black Widow in just two hours, and by the end of the day it became the best first-day advance ticket sale since Endgame,[241] while also surpassing the 24-hour ticket sales of Infinity War, Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), Far From Home, The Rise of Skywalker and Rogue One (2016).[242] No Way Home had the second-highest one-day ticket sales on AMC, with CEO Adam Aron attributing this to Spider-Man-themed non-fungible tokens (NFTs).[242]\n\nThe film also set records in Mexico with $7 million in the first-day ticket sale, which was 40% above Endgame. In the United Kingdom, the film outsold No Time to Die three times in the same twelve-day span before their release, while Brazil's ticket sale was 5% above Endgame at the same point. The film also passed the presale records of The Rise of Skywalker in Poland and No Time to Die in Portugal. Other markets with the best presale records include Spain, Brazil, and Central America.[243]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 93%, with an average score of 7.9/10, based on 432 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A bigger, bolder Spider-Man sequel, No Way Home expands the franchise's scope and stakes without losing sight of its humor and heart.\"[244] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 60 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[245] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the first live-action Spider-Man film and the fourth MCU film overall to earn the score after The Avengers (2012), Black Panther (2018), and Avengers: Endgame.[224] PostTrak reported 96% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 91% saying they would definitely recommend it.[224]\n\nAmelia Emberwing of IGN gave the film 8 out of 10, stating that its \"impact on the universe as a whole, as well as the overall emotional beats, all feel earned\" while praising the performances of Dafoe, Molina, and Foxx.[246] Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood praised Watts's direction and wrote, \"Holland, Zendaya, and Batalon are a priceless trio, and the various villains and 'others' who pop in and out make this pure movie fun of the highest order. Fans will be in heaven\".[247] Peter Debruge of Variety praised Garfield's and Maguire's performances and felt the film \"provides enough resolution for the past two decades of Spider-Man adventures that audiences who've tuned out along the way will be rewarded for giving this one a shot\".[33] Writing for Den of Geek, Don Kaye gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, for its action sequences, performances and chemistry of the cast, stating that \"No Way Home channels the entire spectrum of Spider-Man movies while setting the character on a course all his own at last\".[248] Jennifer Bisset of CNET praised the action sequences, performances, and story, writing: \"A Russo Brothers influence can almost be felt ushering Holland's third Spider-Man movie into new, weightier territory. If the character is to become the next Tony Stark, this is the way to etch a few more scars into a more interesting hero's facade. If you came for the biggest movie of the year, you'll definitely leave satisfied\".[249]\n\nKevin Maher of The Times gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, saying that it was \"As satisfying to watch as it is perilous to discuss\", and described it as \"a dynamite blast of smarty-pants postmodernism that never once abandons its emotional core.\"[250] Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, praising Watts for \"bringing back numerous baddies from the previous Spider-Man universes, delivering a propulsive, slickly choreographed adventure that will appease a broad fanbase this Christmas\" but feeling that the script \"lacks the expected fizz, that sense of shaggy fun struggling to break through a more robotic plot\".[251] Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a \"B−\", feeling that Watts's work was \"satisfying, emotional, and occasionally unsteady\". She found that the script spent \"far too long dwelling on the machinations of people and plans we already know, throwing in some awkward misdirection and simply delaying the inevitable\".[252] The Hollywood Reporter's John DeFore felt that the inclusion of \"multiversal mayhem\" addressed the \"Iron Man-ification of the character\" that made Holland-centric films \"least fun\".[253]\n\nCNN's Brian Lowry praised the humor and wrote, \"What's already apparent, though, is that this movie was conceived to be savored and enjoyed. And in what has become an increasingly elusive phenomenon, that will include whoops and hollers from appreciative fans in theaters, where Spider-Man will first reveal its secrets, and then, more than likely, shows off its legs.\"[254] Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 and praised the performances of Holland and Zendaya, writing: \"There's nothing new or particularly memorable about the serviceable CGI and practical effects, but we remain invested in the outcome in large part because Holland remains the best of the cinematic Spider-Men, while Zendaya lends heart and smarts and warmth to every moment she's onscreen. We continue to root for these two to make it, even if the multiverse isn't always on their side.\"[255] In contrast, Bilge Ebiri of Vulture called the film \"aggressively mediocre\", criticizing the action, comedy and writing, but praising Dafoe – describing him as \"once again gets to have some modest fun with his character's divided self\" – and Garfield, calling him a \"genuine delight\" and naming his the film's best performance.[256] Hannah Strong of Little White Lies criticized the film for poor character development particularly in regard to Holland's Peter Parker character stating, \"It's grating seeing the same character repeatedly fail to learn any lessons or show even a modicum of personal growth\". The same review was also generally critical of the film prioritizing fan service over good storytelling.[257]\n\nNo Way Home was nominated for an Academy Award,[258] three Visual Effects Society awards (winning one),[259][260] a Costume Designers Guild Award,[261] a Golden Reel Award,[262] three Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards (winning all),[263] five Critics' Choice Super Awards (winning three),[264][265] and nine Saturn Awards (winning one),[266] among others. The film was disqualified from consideration for the 75th British Academy Film Awards because it was not made available on BAFTA's streaming service, reportedly due to Sony being concerned about piracy.[267] As part of the ceremony's \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest, the three Spider-Men teaming up was one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment,[268] and the film was the favorite to win the \"Fan Favorite\" film contest according to a Morning Consult survey.[269] It ended up finishing second and fourth, respectively.[270]\n\nBy August 2019, a fourth film in the franchise was in development alongside No Way Home.[56] In February 2021, Holland said No Way Home was the final film under his contract but he hoped to continue playing Spider-Man in the future if asked.[271] That October, Holland said No Way Home was being treated as \"the end of a franchise\" that began with Homecoming, with any additional solo films featuring the MCU Spider-Man characters to be different from the first trilogy of films and feature a tonal change.[27] A month later, Holland said he was unsure if he should continue making Spider-Man films and felt he would have \"done something wrong\" if he was still portraying the character in his thirties. He expressed interest in a film focusing on the Miles Morales version of Spider-Man instead. Despite this, Pascal hoped to continue working with Holland on future Spider-Man films.[73] Later in November, Pascal said there were plans for another trilogy of Spider-Man films starring Holland, with work on the first of those about to begin,[138] though Sony did not yet have official plans for further MCU Spider-Man films.[272]\n\nFeige confirmed in December that he and Pascal, along with Sony and Disney, were actively beginning to develop the story for the next Spider-Man film following Parker's \"momentous decision\" in No Way Home. He promised that the partnership between Sony and Disney would not break down again as it did during the development of No Way Home.[273] In April 2022, following Watts' exit as director of Marvel Studios' The Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025) to take a break from blockbuster films, Deadline Hollywood reported that Sony still expected Watts (along with Holland and Zendaya) to eventually return for the next MCU Spider-Man film.[274] Feige said in February 2023 that they had a story for the film with \"big ideas\" and that writers had begun work on it.[275] Pascal said at the end of May that the film was still in development but that work was put on hold because of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike that began earlier that month, and that work would resume after the strike concluded.[276] By that time, Holland reiterated that the film was in early stages of development and that he had been involved in meetings about it, which were also put on hold because of the writers' strike.[277] In November 2023, Holland again noted he was part of discussions surrounding the film and reiterated his desire to return only if it would \"do justice to the character\".[278] Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed the MCU film Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021), was in early talks to direct the sequel by September 2024.[279] The next month, Holland said filming would begin in mid-2025,[280] and the film was scheduled for release on July 24, 2026, with Cretton's hiring confirmed.[281]\n"

        "content": "\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a 2022 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Doctor Strange. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to Doctor Strange (2016) and the 28th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Sam Raimi, written by Michael Waldron, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange, alongside Elizabeth Olsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Xochitl Gomez, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Rachel McAdams. In the film, Strange must protect America Chavez (Gomez), a teenager capable of traveling the multiverse, from the Scarlet Witch (Olsen).\n\nDoctor Strange director and co-writer Scott Derrickson had plans for a sequel by October 2016. He signed to return as director in December 2018, when Cumberbatch was confirmed to return. The film's title was announced in July 2019 along with Olsen's involvement, while Jade Halley Bartlett was hired to write the film that October. Derrickson stepped down as director in January 2020, citing creative differences. Waldron and Raimi joined the following month and started over, adding elements of the horror genre that Raimi had worked with previously and making Wanda the villain of the film, continuing her story from the Disney+ miniseries WandaVision (2021). Filming began in November 2020 in London but was put on hold in January 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed by March 2021 and concluded in mid-April in Somerset. Shooting also occurred in Surrey and Los Angeles. With a production budget of $350.6 million, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on May 2, 2022, and was released in the United States on May 6, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $955.8 million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2022.\n\nA demon chases America Chavez and a version of Stephen Strange in the space between universes while searching for the Book of Vishanti. Strange is killed and Chavez accidentally creates a portal that transports herself and Strange's corpse to Earth-616,[a] where that universe's version of Stephen Strange rescues Chavez from another demon[b] with help from Wong, the Sorcerer Supreme. Chavez explains that the beings are hunting her because she has the power to travel through the multiverse.\n\nRecognizing witchcraft runes on the demon, Strange consults Wanda Maximoff but soon realizes that she is responsible for the attacks. After acquiring the Darkhold and becoming the Scarlet Witch, Wanda believes that taking Chavez's powers and traveling through the multiverse will allow her to reunite with Billy and Tommy, the children she created during her time in Westview.[c] When Strange refuses to surrender Chavez, Wanda attacks Kamar-Taj and kills many sorcerers. Chavez accidentally transports herself and Strange to Earth-838. Wanda uses the Darkhold to \"dreamwalk\", taking control of her Earth-838 counterpart who lives a suburban life with her own Billy and Tommy. After a surviving sorceress, Sara, sacrifices herself to destroy the Darkhold and break the dreamwalk, an enraged Wanda forces Wong to lead her to Mount Wundagore, the source of the Darkhold's power, to reestablish the dreamwalk.\n\nWhile searching for help, Strange and Chavez are apprehended by Earth-838's Sorcerer Supreme, Karl Mordo, and brought before the Illuminati, a group consisting of Mordo, Peggy Carter, Blackagar Boltagon, Maria Rambeau, Reed Richards, and Charles Xavier. They explain that through reckless use of their universe's Darkhold in an attempt to defeat Thanos, Earth-838's Strange triggered a universe-destroying \"incursion\". After defeating Thanos, the Illuminati executed their Strange to prevent him from causing more harm. Mordo believes that Earth-616's Strange is similarly dangerous, but Wanda reestablishes her dreamwalk at Mount Wundagore and arrives in her Earth-838 counterpart's body before the Illuminati can pass judgment. She brutally kills all the Illuminati except Mordo, whom Strange subdues before fleeing with Chavez. The two escape with help from the Earth-838 version of Strange's ex-fiancé, Christine Palmer, a scientist working with the Illuminati.\n\nStrange, Chavez, and Palmer enter the space between universes to find the Book of Vishanti, which is the antithesis of the Darkhold, but Wanda appears and destroys it. She then takes over Chavez's mind and uses her powers to send Strange and Palmer to an incursion-destroyed universe. Strange defeats the destroyed universe's Strange, who has been corrupted by his Darkhold, and then uses that Darkhold to dreamwalk into the body of his deceased counterpart on Earth-616. With Wong's help, Strange saves Chavez from Wanda and encourages Chavez to use her abilities. Chavez transports Wanda to Earth-838, where she sees Billy and Tommy fearfully recoiling from her while crying for their real mother. Realizing her errors, Wanda relents and uses her powers to bring down Mount Wundagore, simultaneously destroying all copies of the Darkhold throughout the multiverse and sacrificing herself in the process. Chavez returns Strange and Palmer to their respective universes.\n\nSome time later, Kamar-Taj is under repair and the surviving sorcerers, joined by Chavez, continue training. Strange develops a third eye as a result of using the Darkhold and dreamwalking into a corpse. In a mid-credits scene, Strange is approached by a sorceress[d] who warns that his actions have triggered an incursion that he must help repair. Strange follows her into the Dark Dimension.\n\nThe Illuminati of Earth-838 also includes Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier, portraying a different version of the character that he previously played in 20th Century Fox's X-Men film series; Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter / Captain Carter, after voicing another version in the animated series What If...? (2021); Lashana Lynch as Maria Rambeau / Captain Marvel, an alternate version of her character from Captain Marvel (2019); Anson Mount as Blackagar Boltagon / Black Bolt, an alternate version of his role from Marvel's ABC television series Inhumans (2017); and John Krasinski as Reed Richards, a member of the Fantastic Four.[27]\n\nJulian Hilliard and Jett Klyne portray the Earth-838 versions of Wanda's sons Billy and Tommy, reprising their respective roles from WandaVision,[42] while Topo Wresniwiro reprises his role from the first film as Hamir, a Master of the Mystic Arts.[43][44] Also appearing in the film are Sheila Atim as Sara, a Master of the Mystic Arts,[45] and Adam Hugill as the voice of Rintrah, a minotaur-like being from R'Vaal who is a student at Kamar-Taj.[46] Ross Marquand voices the Ultron drones that appear on Earth-838. Marquand previously voiced a different version of Ultron in What If...?,[47] replacing James Spader, who portrayed the Earth-616 Ultron in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015).[48] The character Clea is introduced in the mid-credits scene, portrayed by Charlize Theron,[8] and Waldron makes a cameo appearance as a guest at Palmer's wedding.[49] Bruce Campbell, a frequent collaborator with Raimi, briefly appears in both the main film and post-credits scene as the vendor of an Earth-838 food stall called Pizza Poppa.[50] Scott Spiegel, another frequent collaborator with Raimi, voices one of the Souls of the Damned that attack Strange when he possesses a corpse. Co-producer Richie Palmer also voices one of the Souls of the Damned.[51]\n\nDoctor Strange (2016) co-writer C. Robert Cargill stated in April 2016 that Marvel Studios felt some initial ideas for the film from him and director Scott Derrickson highlighted too much of the \"weird stuff\" associated with the comic book character Doctor Strange to feature in an origin story, but told the duo to hold onto them for potential future films.[52] Derrickson revealed in October that he had plans for a sequel, expressing his love for the character and the visual possibilities that come with him. Derrickson said the first film was \"the tip of an iceberg. There's so much progress that can be made.\" He wanted to follow the example of The Dark Knight (2008) and introduce a villain in the sequel that would allow them to \"go deep [and have] a more visceral experience\". Star Benedict Cumberbatch had signed on for at least one more Doctor Strange film.[53] Derrickson expressed interest in featuring the villain Nightmare,[54] and further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir after their small roles in the first film. He explained that he had been \"kept in the loop\" on how the Avengers films were using Strange due to his close relationships with Joe Russo—the co-director of Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019)—and Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige.[55] Doctor Strange co-writer Jon Spaihts expressed interest in seeing the character Clea appear in a sequel.[56] In April 2017, Derrickson was reported to be returning for a sequel, beginning work after fulfilling his commitments to the television series Locke & Key (2020–2022).[57]\n\nBy December 2018, Derrickson had quietly finalized a deal to direct the sequel, with Cumberbatch, Benedict Wong, and Rachel McAdams reprising their respective roles of Dr. Stephen Strange, Wong, and Christine Palmer. Marvel was beginning to search for a writer,[9][58] with The Hollywood Reporter stating that the script would be written throughout 2019 for a planned filming start in early 2020 and a potential release in May 2021.[9] Feige and Derrickson officially announced the sequel at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2019, revealing the title to be Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and confirming a release date of May 7, 2021.[19] Derrickson wanted the sequel to be the first scary Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film and explore more of the gothic and horror elements from the comic books than the first installment did,[19][59] with co-producer Richie Palmer explaining that the film would use the multiverse to explore \"each definition of the word madness\" and the idea that \"the scariest monsters are the ones that dwell within us\".[60] Feige revealed that the Disney+ series WandaVision (2021) would directly set up the film, with Elizabeth Olsen reprising her role of Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch from the series.[19][61] Additionally, the concept of the multiverse was introduced to the MCU in the first season of Loki (2021),[62] and explored further in the film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), which is set before Multiverse of Madness and sees Cumberbatch reprising his role as Strange.[63][15] After Loki's first-season finale was released, Tom Hiddleston was reported to be reprising his role as Loki in Multiverse of Madness,[64] but ultimately did not appear.[65]\n\nJade Halley Bartlett, an \"up-and-coming screenwriter\", was hired to write the sequel's screenplay in October 2019.[66] Barlett said she had developed the film alongside Derrickson, Feige, and other Marvel Studios executives Louis D'Esposito, Eric Hauserman Carroll, and Palmer for around a year, a process she felt was fun and exciting, and called the creative team scholars of the comic books. She was provided with a binder of every Doctor Strange comic book printed for reference to aid her writing.[67] In December, Feige described the multiverse as \"the next step in the evolution of the MCU\", and said this film would \"crack it wide open\" in a way that would have repercussions for the Disney+ series and the next films in Marvel Studios' Phase Four slate.[68] Later in the month, he clarified that the sequel would not be a horror film, as some reports had described it following the Comic-Con announcement, but it would be a \"big MCU film with scary sequences\". Feige compared these sequences to the films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Gremlins (1984), and Poltergeist (1982), and said Derrickson was good at being \"legitimately scary\" due to his background making horror films. Feige also revealed that the film would introduce several surprising new characters to the MCU, including one that Marvel Studios had been looking for a way to use in an MCU film for some time;[69] this was later revealed to be America Chavez, who was included because her powers are related to the multiverse.[34] Chavez's co-creator Joe Casey was not paid for the character's appearance in the film after he rejected a compensation offer from Marvel Comics that he described as a \"pittance\".[70]\n\nIn January 2020, Marvel Studios and Derrickson announced that he would no longer direct the film due to creative differences. In separate statements, they both said they were thankful for their collaboration so far and Derrickson would remain an executive producer on the film.[71] This was not expected to delay filming, which was set for May 2020.[71][72] Cargill explained that he and Derrickson conceived a story that went in a different direction from what Marvel wanted,[73] and the pair had not yet written a draft of the screenplay so the final film would not be derivative of their work.[74] Derrickson said leaving the film was a difficult decision, but he did not want to compromise on a film that was different from what he wanted to make. His choice to leave was made easier by the fact that he was able to immediately begin work on The Black Phone (2022), another film he wanted to make.[73] Cumberbatch was not consulted regarding the director change and said he was sad to hear about it, but he respected the decision and how it was handled.[75] Some reports suggested that Derrickson left the film because he wanted to make a \"no-holds-barred weird, gnarly, scary movie\" similar to A24's films The Witch (2015) or Hereditary (2018), and Marvel Studios did not want to go in that direction, but Feige denied this and said the studio loved that idea. He explained that it was their intention for the film to serve as a guide into a \"much creepier side\" of the MCU, even after Derrickson's departure,[76] and they wanted to explore the \"mind-bending frightening side\" of the multiverse.[77]\n\nSam Raimi entered negotiations to take over as director by early February.[31] At that time, Chiwetel Ejiofor was expected to reprise his role as Karl Mordo, McAdams was no longer expected to appear,[31] and Michael Waldron was hired to rewrite the film's script after serving as the head writer of Loki's first season.[78][79] Raimi signed on to direct the film a few weeks later.[12] He had been reluctant to direct another Marvel superhero film after the mixed critical reaction to Spider-Man 3 (2007),[80] feeling that he needed a break from that genre,[81] but he accepted the job because of the challenge of getting the film into production right away and because he was a fan of the Doctor Strange character and Derrickson's work on the first film.[80][81] Raimi was curious how making big-budgeted films had changed since his prior film, Oz the Great and Powerful (2013), and he also had to familiarize himself with the existing MCU storylines and characters for the film.[81] Waldron had three weeks to write a new script draft based on the work done by Derrickson and Bartlett. He said this was \"almost impossible\",[82] and Raimi felt \"very rushed and panicked\" trying to meet the May 2020 production start date.[83] The COVID-19 pandemic began to impact film productions during those first three weeks,[82] and pre-production started taking place remotely.[84] Filming was initially still on track to begin in May 2020,[72] until Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the pandemic, moving Multiverse of Madness's release date to November 5, 2021.[85] Raimi was relieved by this delay,[83] which allowed him and Waldron to start writing the script from scratch in a reasonable time, and make the film their own.[82][86] Bartlett had written a draft before the COVID-19 pandemic and said that Raimi and Waldron's version was different from the one she developed with Derrickson.[67]\n\nWaldron watched the director's Spider-Man films (2002–2007) so he could identify Raimi's strengths and write toward them.[87] He described Multiverse of Madness as Raimi's return to \"big superhero movies\", and said it would have every aspect of a Sam Raimi film,[88] including a \"slightly scarier direction\" which he felt Raimi had a strong track record with.[86][88] Palmer said Waldron's work introducing the multiverse in Loki allowed Marvel Studios to \"jump into telling a good story\" without having to re-explain those ideas for the audience, and helped bring \"a lot of heart to [the] sci-fi concepts\".[89] Waldron also used his experience from writing the series Rick and Morty (2013–present), which helped him \"introduce these big sci-fi concepts in ways that were digestible, palatable to the audience and without getting them bogged down in the boring details\".[90] Rather than just expanding the stakes of the film, Waldron saw the multiverse as the \"emotional heart\" of the story that could be used in personal ways, such as using \"what ifs\" and alternate versions of characters to reflect on the film's protagonists, and exploring the characters' right or wrong choices through their alternate versions. Waldron watched Doctor Strange several times, saying he became a \"student\" of that film, to understand Strange's story in the original. He also looked at how the character had developed through his other MCU appearances,[91] and Raimi praised how Waldron's imagination and knowledge of Marvel history contributed to the script.[83] The creative team saw early production work for the animated series What If...? (2021–present) to learn how Strange was portrayed in that series.[92]\n\nWaldron described Wanda as \"the biggest best bullet\" that they had,[93] and said she was destined to become a villain in the MCU, as she did in the comics, especially after the end of WandaVision revealed \"to her that the family she's built is not real. Then she gets the Darkhold... and learns that there is a real version of her children out there. And if you've got the Book of the Damned whispering in your ear long enough that your kids are out there and you could go get 'em, maybe that can push you to do some terrible things.\"[82] If she became a villain at the end of the film, he knew another project would get to have the \"fun\" of using her as a villain. He also wanted to avoid the film getting \"overstuffed\" by adding a different multiverse-related villain such as Jonathan Majors's Kang the Conqueror,[93] and felt that this would create a \"watered-down version of Wanda [who] wouldn't be the protagonist, and she wouldn't really be the antagonist\".[82] Olsen was hesitant about playing the villain after believing that she would just be \"in an ensemble thing\", but she came to feel that the combination of WandaVision and Multiverse of Madness gave her an opportunity to create a sympathetic character in the series who the audience would therefore have conflicted feelings about when seeing the film.[23] Waldron worked closely with Olsen and WandaVision head writer Jac Schaeffer to ensure Wanda's story was a satisfying continuation of the series,[72] while Raimi also studied the series despite not fully seeing it, particularly key moments that directly impacted their plans for the film, to make sure the film maintained \"a proper through line and character-growth dynamic\" for her character.[83] It was important to Olsen that the film not repeat what was done in WandaVision and instead be an evolution of the character, and she requested several adjustments to the script to avoid moments that she found too similar to the series. To justify the many killings that Wanda commits in the film, Olsen focused on the character's perspective of those people being in her way and not listening to her after the loss of her children in the series.[23]\n\nAfter a planned appearance by Cumberbatch in WandaVision was removed late in the development of the series, rewrites to the Multiverse of Madness script were required which Feige described as a \"wonderful combination of very dedicated coordination, and chaos\".[94] These changes include how Strange and Wanda meet in the film.[7] The story of Multiverse of Madness is still set up by WandaVision, but the film was developed to also work for viewers who did not watch the series.[95] For consistency with the Darkhold's appearance, the film's props department designed the prop that was used for WandaVision and then reused it for the film.[96] While writing his first draft, Waldron felt the film needed to \"get drunk [and] find the madness in the multiverse\" by introducing alternate universe versions of known Marvel characters. This led to the introduction of the Illuminati, a secret society from the comics. Waldron had been watching the film Aliens (1986) as inspiration for the script's thriller tone, and enjoyed how the \"badass\" space marines \"just get slaughtered\" by the titular aliens to set the latter up as scarier villains for the rest of that film. He wanted to do something similar with Wanda by introducing the Illuminati as a group of characters that fans would be excited to see and then have Wanda kill them all. The idea of Strange taking control of a dead body for the end of the film came from Waldron and Palmer discussing how he would be able to confront Wanda from a different universe, with the corpse of another version of Strange having been already established at the start of the film. Raimi, Feige, and Cumberbatch were all excited about the idea, despite Raimi initially wanting to avoid a zombie sequence to not repeat what he had done previously with zombie films.[82]\n\nThe film's release was shifted again at the end of April 2020, this time to March 25, 2022, after Sony Pictures rescheduled No Way Home to the November 2021 date.[97] Until then, Waldron had been writing the script expecting Multiverse of Madness to be released before No Way Home. He was in contact with No Way Home writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers throughout the writing process, and after the release date change they adjusted their respective scripts so instead of Multiverse of Madness \"blowing the lid on the multiverse\" it would pick up after No Way Home with Strange already having multiverse experience. This change had a \"knock-down effect\" on the rest of the script.[93] There had been early plans to include Strange's new costume from Multiverse of Madness and America Chavez in No Way Home,[98][70] while a brief cameo of Spider-Man was planned for Multiverse of Madness, but the pandemic ultimately prevented those plans from coming to fruition.[98] Raimi noted that where No Way Home saw characters from other universes enter the MCU, Multiverse of Madness features characters from the MCU entering the multiverse and exploring different universes.[26] Ejiofor confirmed his involvement in June,[99] and Xochitl Gomez joined the cast in October.[100] Cumberbatch revealed that month that filming would start in London by the beginning of November,[101][102] with the production not impacted by a national lockdown in England that was set for November 5 to December 2 due to increased COVID-19 cases.[103]\n\nPrincipal photography began in November 2020 in London,[104][105] under the working title Stellar Vortex.[106] Filming was delayed from an initial May 2020 start date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[72] Olsen began filming her scenes by November 25,[105] shooting back-to-back with WandaVision,[107] and found it odd to transition from the series back to starring in an MCU film.[108][109] At the beginning of December, filming was taking place at Longcross Studios in Longcross, Surrey,[110] where several New York City blocks and sets for the Sanctum Sanctorum were built by production designer Charlie Woods.[111] McAdams soon signed on to return as Palmer,[37] shortly before Feige officially confirmed her involvement on December 10 along with that of Ejiofor, Wong, and Gomez. He also revealed that Gomez would portray America Chavez.[112][113] Cumberbatch had begun filming his scenes by then, after completing his work on No Way Home.[105][114][115] He said the film was more collaborative than his previous MCU appearances, for which he felt like he was \"just along for the ride\".[116]\n\nMany of the actors, including Olsen,[117] Cumberbatch,[75] and Wong, were excited to be working with Raimi.[118] The director said many \"dimensionalized visuals\" were used during shooting to tell the film's story,[77] as he was able to use his preferred camera techniques such as using the camera and perspective to create a feeling of anxiety for audiences.[117][75][119] John Mathieson served as cinematographer,[12] and shot the film with Panavision DXL2 IMAX-certified cameras.[120] Raimi encouraged improvisation,[75][118] explaining that the cast could adapt their interactions due to their knowledge of their own characters and that the script often changed shortly before filming for those scenes began.[121] The ending of the film was still \"up in the air\" when filming began, and Cumberbatch said it took some time for the team to decide on one that tied together all of the characters' stories.[122] Waldron explained that they felt the ending was too happy following all the \"bad shit\" that occurs in the film and wanted to show that Strange would suffer consequences for his actions—including possessing the corpse of a different version of himself—which tied into Mordo's warning from the first film: \"The bill comes due.\" This led to them adding the ending scene where Strange develops a third eye in his forehead, and Waldron felt this was the sort of twist that horror films often end on.[82] Elaborating on that tone, Olsen said they were going for a \"horror show vibe\",[123] comparing it to Raimi's Evil Dead films with aspects of the horror genre such as \"constant fear\". She felt it was \"more than a glossy Indiana Jones movie\" and would be darker than those films,[124][119] with Raimi trying to make \"the scariest Marvel movie\"[108][109] and create \"as much tension for the audience\" as possible.[77]\n\nOlsen shot for three weeks before pandemic restrictions increased near the end of December due to a surge of COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom, with another lockdown in England announced from January 6, 2021.[125][126] The scenes of Scarlet Witch massacring the Illuminati were shot at the British Museum of London, with Marvel using CGI to add a new room with a glass entrance and a few statues for the background.[127] Filming resumed in early 2021, and at some point, Cumberbatch had to temporarily pause filming after being in close contact with a member of the production who had a false positive test.[75] In mid-March, Cumberbatch said they were in the middle of production,[114] and Ejiofor had begun filming his scenes in London by then.[128] Filming occurred at Broomfield Hill Car Park in Richmond Park for the week of March 25.[129] Shooting took place at Freemasons' Hall, London, for a few weeks in April.[130] On April 15, Feige said they were in the final week of filming,[131] with shooting taking place from that day until April 17 at Burrow Hill Cider Farm in Somerset. Jett Klyne and Julian Hilliard, who respectively portrayed Wanda's sons Tommy and Billy in WandaVision, were reportedly on set at the farm,[132] and were confirmed to be in the film in April 2022.[133]\n\nBob Murawski and Tia Nolan co-edited the film.[134] Some additional photography had been completed by mid-September 2021,[135] with Olsen and Wong completing their work.[135][118] The film was once again delayed in October, this time to May 6, 2022.[136] Later that month, Cumberbatch said they were in the middle of more additional photography, with further reshoots set for November and December,[137] over at least six weeks in Los Angeles. The Hollywood Reporter said this photography was \"significant\" and included two weeks dedicated to filming that could not be completed during principal photography because of actor availability issues and COVID-related slowdowns.[138] Cumberbatch confirmed the reshoots were being used to make adjustments to already shot material, while also filming parts that \"were just impossible to do [during principal photography] because of logistics, COVID etc.\"[139] The Hollywood Reporter later reported that the reshoots would allow the film to have \"more fun with the multiverse\" by adding more cameo appearances and variants of established characters, similar to No Way Home and the first season of Loki.[140] The film's teaser trailer was released in late December and confirmed the involvement of Michael Stuhlbarg as Nicodemus West, reprising his role from Doctor Strange.[36] It also revealed that Cumberbatch would portray multiple versions of Strange in the film.[15] The reshoots reportedly wrapped during the week of December 13,[140] but additional filming continued in early January 2022. The latter was completed on January 8.[141] By the end of the month, Raimi had assembled a cut of the film that would be presented to test audiences, and said there was potential for more reshoots to occur if the test screenings found that clarification or improvement were needed;[142] Cumberbatch was working on further reshoots in the United Kingdom by March 13.[143]\n\nPatrick Stewart, who portrayed Charles Xavier / Professor X in the X-Men film series, was revealed to be appearing in the film in an undisclosed role with the release of the full trailer in February 2022;[144][16] Stewart was believed to be reprising the role of Xavier,[145] which had previously been the subject of speculation.[16] A poster for the film, released at the same time, additionally teased the inclusion of Peggy Carter / Captain Carter, a character who was introduced in What If...?.[146] Stewart initially denied that he was in the film,[147] but soon admitted that he was.[148] The trailer also revealed that Topo Wresniwiro would reprise his role of Hamir from Doctor Strange.[44][43] A creature resembling prominent Doctor Strange villain Shuma-Gorath appears in the film, but it is given the name Gargantos, which comes from a different comic book character, because the rights to the name Shuma-Gorath belong to Heroic Signatures.[6] Gargantos' eye was modeled after that of Olsen's to foreshadow her role as the film's antagonist.[149] The cosmic entity the Living Tribunal also makes a brief appearance.[150] Discussing Stewart's involvement, as well as assumptions based on the trailer that the Illuminati would be appearing in the film, Palmer said returning actors would not necessarily be portraying characters that had been seen before, and if Marvel Studios were to introduce the Illuminati they would do a \"more MCU-driven\" version of the group.[151]\n\nThe Illuminati's appearance was officially confirmed in March;[152] and the team features actors portraying new versions of their characters from previous projects: Stewart plays a new version of Xavier that combines elements from his previous performances, including a line of dialogue from X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), with elements from X-Men: The Animated Series (1992–1997);[153] Ejiofor plays a new version of Mordo; Hayley Atwell portrays Captain Carter after voicing the What If...? version; Lashana Lynch plays a different version of Maria Rambeau / Captain Marvel from the one she portrayed in Captain Marvel (2019); and Anson Mount portrays an alternate version of Blackagar Boltagon / Black Bolt from his role in Marvel's ABC television series Inhumans (2017). Also in the group is John Krasinski as Fantastic Four member Reed Richards. Krasinski had been a popular suggestion for the role by fans for some time, especially since the announcement of a new Fantastic Four film set in the MCU.[27] When Lynch was approached to return, she assumed she would be playing an ancestor of Rambeau and was surprised to learn she would be an alternate version of Captain Marvel.[154] The Illuminati sequence was filmed in pieces, with many of the actors not being on set together. Krasinski's footage was filmed during reshoots to replace a planned cameo appearance by Daniel Craig, who chose not to film the role because he did not believe a single day of filming was worth the risk of catching COVID-19 and spreading it to his family.[155][156] Craig was reportedly set to portray the character Balder the Brave in the scene.[155] Olsen did not meet Krasinski while shooting the scene in which Scarlet Witch kills Richards, and she instead filmed the scene with a stand-in.[157] Due to safety protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Stewart and other leading actors filmed their scenes in isolation without other actors present, which he found to be frustrating and disappointing.[158]\n\nWaldron said the final line-up of the Illuminati was similar to the one in his first draft,[82] but with some other suggestions coming from Feige. Waldron considered including Namor, a member of the Illuminati in the comics, but Marvel Studios did not allow the character to appear in any MCU projects before the film Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022), in which he was played by Tenoch Huerta;[153][159] Waldron's first draft also included an Earth-838 counterpart of Evangeline Lilly's Hope van Dyne / The Wasp as a member of the Illuminati, who would have been killed by Wanda clapping her hands to kill her.[160] Storyboards by artist Soren Bendt for the Illuminati massacre scene suggest that, in addition to Balder the Brave, an Earth-838 counterpart of Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger, who was previously portrayed by Jeff Bridges in Iron Man (2008), was also considered for the group's lineup.[161] There were also rumors that Tom Cruise would be portraying an alternate version of Tony Stark / Iron Man known as Superior Iron Man in the film after being in contention for the role back in the 1990s before Robert Downey Jr. was cast as the title character in 2006. Waldron expressed interest in the idea, but Cruise was never approached due to his filming schedule for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning (2023) and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning (2025).[82] Other rumors about potential cameos included an appearance of Ryan Reynolds reprising his role as Wade Wilson / Deadpool from Fox's Deadpool (2016) and Deadpool 2 (2018);[162] Waldron confirmed there had been discussions about bringing Reynolds in to play Deadpool before they decided that the film was not \"the right place\" to feature him.[163] Another character introduced in the film is Clea, with Charlize Theron cast in the role. Waldron said they wanted to include her in the film but felt they needed to resolve Strange's relationship with Christine Palmer first, so the character's introduction was saved for the mid-credits scene to set her up as a potential new love interest in a future story.[41]\n\nIndustrial Light & Magic (ILM), Digital Domain, Framestore, Luma Pictures, Capital T, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Wētā FX, Trixter, Crafty Apes, and Perception worked on the visual effects of the film,[164][165] in which an estimated 2,000 VFX shots were created.[166] Framestore worked on the multiverse jumping sequence with Strange and Chavez, while Luma Pictures worked on the Gargantos fight scene.[164] Perception also designed the film's main-on-end title sequence, which employs colorful Rorschach test visuals because Raimi wanted the sequence to \"both complement and contrast the film\".[167] Animators from Disney worked to create another version of the Walt Disney Productions film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), with a different color palette, for a scene in Multiverse of Madness.[168] Graham Churchyard served as costume designer and created most of the costumes for the film, except for those worn by Black Bolt and Richards, both of which could not be completed in time due to travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. They were created through visual effects instead.[169] In late August 2022, Waldron revealed that one of the first drafts of the film's script included a post-credits scene involving a seemingly alive Richards, but the idea was scrapped.[170] Another draft of the script included a scene of Strange meeting a variant of himself named Melvin, who would have been depicted as a street magician with no mystical abilities.[168] Gomez noted that Marvel asked for numerous rewrites of the script from Waldron.[171]\n\nDoctor Strange composer Michael Giacchino was set to return for the sequel by October 2019, when Derrickson was set as director.[172] After Raimi took over, Danny Elfman was hired as composer; Elfman previously worked with Raimi on Darkman (1990), A Simple Plan (1998), Spider-Man (2002), Spider-Man 2 (2004), and Oz the Great and Powerful (2013).[173] By February 2021, Elfman had begun working on music to be used during filming, but would not begin work on the actual score for several months.[173] In January 2022, Elfman said he was completing work on the score,[174] including conducting an orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London.[174][83] Elfman's frequent collaborator Steve Bartek worked on the score remotely over Zoom.[174] A soundtrack album featuring Elfman's score was released digitally by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on May 4,[175] with three \"spoiler tracks\" that were excluded from the initial release being made available on May 20.[176]\n\nElfman referenced Giacchino's Doctor Strange theme in a similar way to how he used Alan Silvestri's theme from The Avengers (2012) when working on Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015).[177] The score also features the song \"WandaVision!\" by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, from the WandaVision episode \"Don't Touch That Dial\", when Wanda is first introduced; Silvestri's \"Captain America March\" theme from Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) for Atwell's Captain Carter appearance;[178] and the main theme from X-Men '97 by the Newton Brothers, which is an updated version of the main theme from X-Men: The Animated Series composed by Ron Wasserman, for the introduction of Xavier. For legal reasons, the latter theme is credited to The Animated Series music executives Haim Saban and Shuki Levy.[178][179]\n\nA teaser trailer for the film was played after the end credits of Spider-Man: No Way Home,[15] before being released online on December 22, 2021.[180] Matt Webb Mitovich of TVLine called it a \"rousing, thrilling trailer\" and noted the ending that revealed an alternate version of Strange. He believed this was Doctor Strange Supreme, an alternate version of the character introduced in What If...?.[181] Inverse's Alex Welch felt it was a \"suitably psychedelic teaser, full of revelations and fun moments that should leave Marvel fans gobsmacked\", and suggested the film would tie together \"many of the multiversal threads left hanging\" from No Way Home, WandaVision, and the first seasons of Loki and What If...?.[182] Writing for Decider, Alex Zalben believed the film was a \"direct result\" of What If...?, which \"instantly mak[es] the animated series far more important than Marvel fans might have originally realized\".[183] James Grebey at Syfy Wire said there was \"a very ominous aura to the whole trailer\".[184] Daniel Chin of The Ringer felt the trailer had \"creepy imagery\" and that it was \"expected to separate itself from other Marvel projects even further by weaving in horror elements\", while also noting how the film won't have to introduce the multiverse, and can instead explore it even further, and also how it'll be the \"first real attempt to blend existing story lines from its Disney+ series with its big-screen properties\", while he thought made it the \"first major crossover event in Phase 4\".[185] Also in December, merchandise began to be made available with the reveal of Marvel Legends figures based on the film.[186]\n\nA teaser aired during Super Bowl LVI on February 13, 2022, with the full-length trailer debuting online afterward.[16] Justin Carter at Gizmodo highlighted how the trailer continued the first film's \"visually trippy\" approach to alternate dimensions while adding more horror elements, and was also excited by the brief appearance of America Chavez,[144] while his colleague Germain Lussier felt, compared to the teaser, the trailer \"raised the stakes exponentially with all manner of wild revelations and images\".[187] Entertainment Weekly's Devan Coggan also felt the trailer was \"trippy\" and added that it \"seems to have more in common with Raimi's iconic horror films\".[188] The Verge's Charles Pulliam-Moore said the trailer did a better job conveying the film's plot than the teaser, and he felt the film would be the \"culmination of all the big-picture troubles\" teased in WandaVision and Loki.[189] Many commentators noted the revelation of Patrick Stewart's involvement in the trailer and the implication he could reprise his X-Men role of Charles Xavier / Professor X,[144][16][190][145] which led to speculation that Multiverse of Madness would introduce the MCU version of the Illuminati.[191][192][193][194] RelishMix reported that the trailer had 93.12 million views in 24 hours across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram, which was the top trailer among those airing during the Super Bowl according to their metrics. Disney reported 143 million online views across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, and Google searches, and 55 million broadcast views.[195]\n\nFunko Pops based on the film were revealed in March 2022.[196] In April, Procter & Gamble released a commercial promoting the film and Tide laundry detergent featuring Wong and the Cloak of Levitation.[197] Later that month, Disney showcased the opening sequence of the film at CinemaCon.[198] The film also partnered with G Fuel and Xbox, which created custom cobranded console kits and controllers inspired by the film, while also featuring a Jaeger-Le Coultre watch in the film. It also partnered with Mori Building Company, a Japanese urban landscape developer, which turned its café and menu into an interactive photo op experience to promote the film. Additional partnerships included Cadillac, Maybank, Shell US in the Asia–Pacific (APAC) region, and also Xiaomi and T-Mobile in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region.[199][200][201][202] Three episodes of the series Marvel Studios: Legends were released on April 29, exploring Doctor Strange, Wong, and Scarlet Witch using footage from their previous MCU appearances.[203] Eight VTubers from Hololive Production promoted the film in a special pre-premiere stream event on YouTube on May 3.[204] Disney spent a total of $150 million promoting the film.[205]\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on May 2, 2022.[206][207] The film was released in several countries, including Germany, Italy, Sweden, and South Korea on May 4, 2022, in the United Kingdom on May 5,[208] and in the United States on May 6.[136] It was released in 4DX, RealD 3D, IMAX, Dolby Cinema, ScreenX, and Superscreen formats.[209][210] It was originally set for release on May 7, 2021,[19] but was pushed back to November 5, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[85] before it was further shifted to March 25, 2022, after Sony rescheduled Spider-Man: No Way Home to November 2021.[97] In October 2021, it was shifted once again to its final May 2022 date.[136] The film is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[211]\n\nIn April 2022, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that the film would not be released in Saudi Arabia due to the inclusion of America Chavez, a gay character, given the region's censorship of LGBTQ references.[212] Nawaf Alsabhan, Saudi Arabia's general supervisor of cinema classification, said the film had not been banned from the country but revealed that Disney was \"not willing\" to grant their request of cutting \"barely 12 seconds\" of a scene in which Chavez refers to her \"two moms\".[213] The film had been set to release in several Persian Gulf countries on May 5, before advanced tickets were removed from cinema websites in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar. Tickets were still available in the United Arab Emirates, which The Hollywood Reporter stated was an indication that the film could still be released there.[212] IMAX Corporation also confirmed that the film would not be released in Egypt.[214] Cumberbatch was disappointed by the countries' decisions to not release the film, saying: \"We've come to know from those repressive regimes that their lack of tolerance is exclusionary to people who deserve to be not only included, but celebrated for who they are and made to feel part of a society and a culture and not punished for their sexuality. It feels truly out of step with everything that we've experienced as a species, let alone where we're at globally more as a culture, but frankly, it's just even more reason why this isn't tokenism to include an LGBTQ+ community member\".[215] Deadline Hollywood reported in late April that the film was unlikely to be released in China after a newspaper box for The Epoch Times, a newspaper that opposes the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), was noticed in the film's trailer. It had been submitted for review to Chinese officials by that time.[216] In mid-May, Disney CEO Bob Chapek said the situation was complicated but noted that the film was already commercially successful without a release in China.[217]\n\nThe film began streaming on Disney+ on June 22, 2022,[218] with the option to view the theatrical version of the film or an IMAX Enhanced version.[219] It was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on July 26. The home media includes audio commentary, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and various behind-the-scenes featurettes.[220] According to Samba TV, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was watched by 2.1 million U.S. households within its first five days of being available on Disney+; this was comparable to the viewership of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) and Eternals (2021).[221] According to the streaming aggregator JustWatch, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was the sixth most streamed film in the United States in 2022.[222]\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness grossed $411.3 million in the United States and Canada and $544.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $955.8 million.[3][4] It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2022.[223] Forbes estimated the film made a profit of $127.3 million.[2] The film grossed $42 million in ticket presales through Fandango, and sold the most tickets on the platform since Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), while also surpassing ticket presales for The Batman (2022) within 24 hours.[224][198] Its worldwide opening weekend of $452.4 million was the ninth-largest opening ever, and marked the highest May debut of all-time for IMAX ($33 million).[225]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film grossed $187.4 million in its opening weekend, surpassing the $151 million opening weekend gross of Spider-Man 3 (2007) to become the highest of Sam Raimi's career. It grossed $90.7 million on its opening day, which included $36 million from Thursday previews. The preview was the second-best preview during the pandemic behind Spider-Man: No Way Home and the overall eighth-largest preview performance, while the opening-day gross was the seventh-highest in industry history. The film's $90.7 million opening day tally is also the largest single-day gross in May of all time.[226] In its second weekend, the film grossed $61 million, becoming one of the MCU's biggest second-weekend box office drops. The 67% decline was attributed by Deadline Hollywood to the \"bad word of mouth\" on the film and its CinemaScore grade, while EntTelligence saw more than 17% downsize of available seats for the film, resulting in fewer showtimes which also led to the decline.[227] In its third weekend, the film grossed $31.6 million.[228] The film grossed $17 million in its fourth weekend for a running total of $376.1 million, passing The Batman's $369.3 million to become the highest-grossing film of 2022 (later surpassed by Top Gun: Maverick).[229][230] It ended up being the fourth highest-grossing film of 2022 in this region.[231]\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, Multiverse of Madness grossed $265 million from 49 markets within its opening weekend, landing at number one in numerous markets. The film grossed $27.2 million from 20 markets on its opening day, surpassing the first-day overall results of Doctor Strange (2016) by 153% and The Batman by 210%, but falling behind No Way Home by 4%. The film had the highest opening day gross for a film released during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines and Thailand, with $1.2 million in both markets, and the second-best ditto in France ($3 million), Italy ($2.2 million), and Germany ($1.8 million). In Malaysia, the film grossed $1.6 million on its opening day to become the second highest in the country's history. The film grossed $10.3 million from its previews in Latin America, including from Mexico ($3.5 million) and Brazil ($2.7 million).[232] As of June 12, 2022[update], the film's largest markets are the United Kingdom ($51.4 million), South Korea ($49.2 million), Mexico ($40.6 million), Brazil ($33.1 million), and France ($27.7 million).[233]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 74%, with an average score of 6.5/10, based on 465 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness labors under the weight of the sprawling MCU, but Sam Raimi's distinctive direction casts an entertaining spell.\"[234] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 65 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[235] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 82% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 69% saying they would definitely recommend it.[226]\n\nCritics had varied opinions on the film, though many praised Sam Raimi's direction for its distinctive style. Don Kaye of Den of Geek and Owen Gleiberman of Variety both noted Raimi's touch, with Kaye appreciating the comic book weirdness and Gleiberman acknowledging the excessive CGI but enjoying Raimi's flair.[236][237] Similarly, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly found Raimi's direction \"wildly refreshing\", and Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood likened the film's storytelling to Raimi's earlier horror works, such as The Evil Dead.[238][239] However, not all reviews were glowing. David Ehrlich of IndieWire felt that Doctor Strange's character had been diluted and offered a mixed view on Raimi's impact,[240] while Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com criticized the film's characterization and excessive reliance on CGI, labeling it a \"Frankenstein movie\".[134] Similarly, Alonso Duralde of TheWrap compared the film unfavorably to Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022), criticizing the writing and lack of character development, though he did appreciate the score and visuals.[241] Overall, while Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness received praise for its unique direction under Raimi and strong performances, particularly from Elizabeth Olsen, the film's heavy reliance on CGI, its plot complexities, and issues with character development left some critics divided.[242][243][244][245]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced.[265] The special on this film, \"The Making of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\", was released on Disney+ on July 8, 2022.[266]\n"

        "content": "\n\nThor: Love and Thunder is a 2022 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Thor. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and the 29th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Taika Waititi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, and stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor alongside Christian Bale, Tessa Thompson, Jaimie Alexander, Waititi, Russell Crowe, and Natalie Portman. In the film, Thor tries to find inner peace, but must return to action and recruit Valkyrie (Thompson), Korg (Waititi), and Jane Foster (Portman)—who is now the Mighty Thor—to stop Gorr the God Butcher (Bale) from eliminating all gods.\n\nHemsworth and Waititi had discussed plans for a sequel to Ragnarok by January 2018. Love and Thunder was announced in July 2019, with Hemsworth, Waititi, and Thompson all set to return, as well as Portman who did not appear in Ragnarok. Waititi wanted to differentiate Love and Thunder from Ragnarok, seeking to make a romance film and 1980s-inspired adventure. He adapted elements from Jason Aaron's run on Thor comic books during the 2010s, which similarly debuted Gorr and saw Foster take on the mantle and powers of Thor whilst under treatment for cancer. Robinson joined to contribute to the script in February 2020, and further casting was revealed later that year including the appearance of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Production was expected to begin in late 2020 but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming ultimately began in January 2021 in Sydney, Australia with Barry Idoine as the director of photography, and concluded at the beginning of June.\n\nThor: Love and Thunder premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 23, 2022, and was released in the United States on July 8, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film for its light-heartedness, action sequences, and the performances of Hemsworth, Bale and Portman, but criticized the screenplay and tonal inconsistencies; while its humor and visual effects were met with polarized responses,[6] many critics deemed the film inferior to Ragnarok. The film grossed $760.9 million worldwide, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2022, as well as the second-highest-grossing film in the Thor franchise.\n\nGorr and his daughter, Love, the last of their race, struggle in a barren desert. Despite their prayers to their god, Rapu, Love dies. The god-killing Necrosword calls to Gorr, leading him to Rapu's lush realm. After Rapu cruelly mocks and dismisses Gorr's plight, he renounces the god, causing Rapu to start strangling him. The Necrosword offers itself to Gorr, who kills Rapu with it and vows to kill all gods. Gorr is granted the ability to manipulate shadows and produce monsters but is cursed with impending death and corruption under the sword's influence.\n\nThor has joined the Guardians of the Galaxy after the Avengers' battle against Thanos.[a] He learns of a distress signal from Sif, so he parts ways with the team. He finds an injured Sif, who warns that Gorr's next target is New Asgard. Meanwhile, Dr. Jane Foster, Thor's ex-girlfriend, has been diagnosed with stage four terminal cancer. With medical treatment proving ineffective, she travels to New Asgard hoping that Thor's hammer Mjolnir, which was previously fractured by Hela,[b] might heal her.\n\nDue to an enchantment Thor unknowingly placed on it years earlier to protect Foster, Mjolnir reforges and bonds itself to her. Thor arrives in New Asgard just as Gorr's attack begins. Thor is surprised to find Foster wielding Mjolnir, but teams up with her, Valkyrie, and Korg to fight Gorr. The group thwarts Gorr, but he escapes, kidnapping several Asgardian children and imprisoning them in the Shadow Realm. The group travels to Omnipotence City to warn the other gods and ask for their help in creating an army. The leader of the gods, Zeus, is unwilling to help, thinking they can remain safe and hidden from Gorr in the city; he also believes that Gorr will not be able to achieve his stated goal of visiting the realm of Eternity, where he will be granted one wish, presumably to destroy all gods. As a security precaution, Zeus orders the group's capture to prevent them from exposing the city's location to Gorr. When Zeus injures Korg, Thor impales Zeus with his own thunderbolt, which Valkyrie steals before they escape to confront Gorr in the Shadow Realm. On the way, Thor learns of Foster's cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe group arrives at the Shadow Realm but are unable to locate the children. Foster sees ancient drawings that depict Thor's battle-axe Stormbreaker as a way to summon the Bifrost to enter Eternity, and deduces the trap laid out by Gorr. She throws away Stormbreaker to prevent Gorr from accessing it. However, Gorr overpowers the group and threatens to kill Foster, forcing Thor to summon it back. Gorr successfully steals Stormbreaker and injures Valkyrie before a weakened Foster collapses.\n\nUpon traveling back to New Asgard, Thor discovers that Foster's Thor form is not allowing her body to naturally fight the cancer. Due to this, Thor travels to Eternity's altar alone and using Zeus's thunderbolt, imbues the children with his power to fight Gorr's monsters while he battles Gorr. When Foster senses that Gorr is about to kill Thor, she joins the battle with Mjolnir to save him. They destroy the Necrosword, freeing Gorr from its influence, but the three are brought into Eternity's realm. With Gorr poised to make his wish, Thor implores Gorr to revive his daughter instead of destroying the gods. Thor then leaves Gorr to make his decision and attends to Foster, who succumbs to her illness and dies in his arms. Moved by their display, Gorr wishes for Eternity to revive Love, which it grants. As Gorr dies from the curse, he requests Thor to take care of Love.\n\nIn the aftermath, the children return to New Asgard, where Valkyrie and Sif commence their training, and a monument is erected in Foster's memory. Thor adopts Love, who accompanies him in his heroics, with Thor wielding Mjolnir and Love wielding Stormbreaker. In a mid-credits scene, back in Omnipotence City, a recuperating Zeus sends his son Hercules to kill Thor. In a post-credits scene, Foster arrives at the gates of Valhalla, where Heimdall welcomes her.\n\nAdditionally, the Guardians of the Galaxy are featured in the film, with Chris Pratt, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, Sean Gunn, Vin Diesel, and Bradley Cooper reprising their respective MCU roles as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, Nebula, Drax the Destroyer, Mantis, Kraglin Obfonteri, Groot, and Rocket.[28] Matt Damon, Sam Neill, and Luke Hemsworth reprise their roles as Asgardian actors respectively playing Loki, Odin, and Thor from Ragnarok, with Melissa McCarthy joining them as an Asgardian actress playing Hela,[29][30] and McCarthy's husband Ben Falcone as the stage manager.[31] Miek, who previously appeared in Ragnarok and Avengers: Endgame (2019) via CGI, is voiced by Stephen Murdoch, while Carly Rees provides the motion capture performance for the character.[20][32] Also returning from previous MCU media are Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgård as Foster's colleagues Darcy Lewis and Erik Selvig, respectively, and Idris Elba as Heimdall in the post-credits scene. Daley Pearson appears as New Asgard tour guide Darryl Jacobson, after first portraying the role in Marvel Studios' Team Thor short film series.[30] Archive footage from previous MCU films of Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Rene Russo as Frigga,[33] Ray Stevenson as Volstagg, Tadanobu Asano as Hogun, and Zachary Levi as Fandral is featured at the beginning of the film.[34] Chanique Greyling portrays a young Frigga during a flashback sequence.[33]\n\nDeities introduced in the film include: Simon Russell Beale as the Olympian god Dionysus, based on the Greek mythological deity of the same name;[20] Jonathan Brugh (who appeared as Deacon Brucke in Waititi's 2014 film What We Do in the Shadows) as Rapu, a god from Gorr's home planet who becomes his first victim;[30] Akosia Sabet as Bast, a goddess who is a member of both the Heliopolitan and Wakandan pantheons, based on the Egyptian mythological deity Bastet;[35] Kuni Hashimoto as the Japanese god Jademurai;[33] Carmen Foon as the Roman goddess Minerva;[36] and Stephen Hunter as the Fur God.[33] Also appearing in the film are Kieron L. Dyer as Axl, Heimdall's son,[37] Chris Hemsworth's daughter India as Love, Gorr's daughter,[20] and Stephen Curry as Yakan, the ruler of the planet Indigarr.[38] Cameos in the film include Bale, Portman, and Waititi's children as New Asgard children;[39] Hemsworth's wife, Elsa Pataky, as the wolf woman who was one of Thor's past lovers;[31] Indiana Evans as one of the Zeusettes;[39] Jenny Morris as a New Asgard citizen;[20] Chloé Gouneau as Foster's mother Elaine in a flashback sequence;[40] Dave Cory as Dwayne, a Kronan who becomes Korg's partner in a romantic relationship;[41] and Brett Goldstein as Zeus's son Hercules in the mid-credits scene.[30]\n\nJeff Goldblum and Peter Dinklage were both originally set to reprise their respective roles as Grandmaster from previous MCU media and Eitri from Avengers: Infinity War (2018), but their scenes were cut from the theatrical release.[42] Lena Headey was also set to appear in the film, but her scenes were cut as well.[43]\n\nShortly after the release of the third Thor film, Thor: Ragnarok, in November 2017, that film's director Taika Waititi and executives from Marvel Studios met to discuss ideas for another film, which was green-lit following the positive responses to Ragnarok.[44] Chris Hemsworth indicated in January 2018 that he was interested in continuing to play Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), despite his contract with Marvel Studios being set to end with his role in Avengers: Endgame (2019).[45] By then, Hemsworth and Waititi had discussed what they would want in a potential fourth Thor film,[46] and Hemsworth said a month later that he would consider returning if there was \"another great script\".[47] Tessa Thompson, who plays Valkyrie in the MCU films, believed in April 2019 that a pitch had been made for a Ragnarok sequel that involved Waititi returning.[48] Hemsworth said then that he would continue to play Thor for as long as possible, crediting Waititi with revitalizing his interest in the role after he became exhausted and underwhelmed with it prior to making Ragnarok.[49]\n\nIn July 2019, Waititi officially signed on to write and direct a fourth Thor film, with Hemsworth expected to reprise his role.[50] Waititi was not interested in repeating what they did with Ragnarok, instead wanting to do \"something more interesting for myself to keep the whole thing ignited and to make sure that I'm feeling creatively stimulated\".[13] Later that month, at San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige announced the film as Thor: Love and Thunder, with a release date of November 5, 2021. Hemsworth and Thompson were confirmed to be returning along with Natalie Portman, reprising her role of Jane Foster from Thor (2011) and Thor: The Dark World (2013).[7] Hemsworth, who would also serve as an executive producer,[51] was paid $20 million upfront for the film,[52] an increase from the $15 million upfront salary he earned for each of his appearances in Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Endgame.[53] Portman agreed to return to the franchise, after her character had not been included in Ragnarok, following a single meeting with Waititi, who was given creative freedom from Marvel Studios to reimagine her role in the film, in which he offered to portray the character in a different and fresh way, with a \"license to be adventurous and fun and funny\".[25][54][55] Thompson and Feige added that Valkyrie's bisexuality would be addressed in the sequel, retroactively making her Marvel Studios' first LGBTQ superhero.[17][56] Marvel Studios executive Brad Winderbaum was producing the film alongside Feige.[11]\n\nDon Harwin, the Minister for the Arts for the Australian state of New South Wales, announced at the end of July that Thor: Love and Thunder would be filmed at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney back-to-back with Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021), with work set to begin on Love and Thunder there in March 2020 ahead of an August 2020 filming start. The production was set to receive over AU$24 million (US$18 million) of subsidies from the Australian and New South Wales governments. Marvel Studios vice president David Grant said shooting the two films back-to-back would provide continuous employment for local crews, with Love and Thunder expected to generate over AU$178 million (US$134 million) for the local economy. He added that the studio would work with \"local educational institutions in creating internship opportunities\".[57] Jeff Goldblum said in August 2019 that there was a chance he could reprise his Ragnarok role of the Grandmaster in the sequel,[58] and Waititi confirmed in October that he would be reprising his own role of Korg from Ragnarok and Endgame.[19] Christian Bale entered talks to join the cast in January 2020,[59] with pre-production expected to begin in April.[60] Thompson confirmed a month later that Bale would star as the villain in the film,[61] while Vin Diesel, who voices Groot in the MCU films, said he had discussed the film with Waititi and had been told the Guardians of the Galaxy would be appearing in it.[62] In early April, Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the COVID-19 pandemic, moving Thor: Love and Thunder's release date to February 18, 2022.[63] Pre-production on the film was delayed due to the pandemic, with Waititi unsure when production would continue.[64] At the end of the month, Disney moved the release date up to February 11, 2022.[65] By July, filming was set to start in early 2021.[66]\n\nWhen announcing the film in July 2019, Waititi said it would adapt elements from Jason Aaron's Mighty Thor comic books by having Foster become a hero called the Mighty Thor.[7][67] Feige said that the film would include a lot of elements from Marvel comics and that the story line of Foster becoming the Mighty Thor would be an important part,[25][67] explaining that Marvel considered the Mighty Thor run to be one of the best recent comic books. Waititi read the comic while working on Ragnarok, and when he agreed to direct another Thor film, he told Marvel that he wanted to include Foster as the Mighty Thor.[25] The studio agreed to adapt Aaron's storyline and include Portman following discussions with Waititi about where the story could lead.[26] Waititi said they stuck close to Foster's storyline from those comics and tried to adapt its best parts. He also explained that Thor having his axe Stormbreaker and then seeing his hammer Mjolnir return \"in the hands of someone else\" and \"no longer [being] his hammer\" would explore \"the idea that someone's taking his place\", which he felt some fans assumed would occur, but did not believe this as such.[68] Aaron served as a consultant on the film.[69] A. C. Bradley, the creator and head writer of the animated series What If...? (2021–present), pitched an episode of that series in which Foster would have become Thor, but the idea was rejected because the storyline was already being used for Love and Thunder.[70]\n\nIn August, Waititi was reported to have completed a script for the film,[71] but he denied this later that month.[72] While promoting his film Jojo Rabbit (2019) in October, Waititi said he had completed the first draft of the screenplay,[73] but the story would change throughout filming and editing. He was unsure if the film would include the storyline from Aaron's run in which Foster suffers from breast cancer, which he said was a powerful part of the comics.[74] Portman later said Foster's treatment from cancer would be explored in the film.[24] Waititi added that Marvel was still discussing how much time would pass between Endgame and Love and Thunder, and that this would affect whether Thor is still carrying the extra weight he is depicted with in Endgame, which earned him the nicknames \"Fat Thor\" and \"Bro Thor\". Waititi did note that he wanted to \"keep changing it up with Thor. He's so interesting when he's changing all the time.\"[73] The film is set eight years after Thor and Foster broke up, around 2024.[75] Waititi also acknowledged fans \"shipping\" Valkyrie with Brie Larson's Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel but said he did not intend to include a romantic relationship between the pair because he would rather surprise fans than do something by popular demand.[76] Jennifer Kaytin Robinson was hired to work on the film's screenplay with Waititi in February 2020.[77] Waititi received sole screenplay credit on the film's theatrical poster, with Robinson credited with him for the story,[78] before the final credits from the Writers Guild of America credited both Waititi and Robinson as the film's writers.[79]\n\nThor: Love and Thunder follows Thor as he attempts to find inner peace, but must return to action and recruit Valkyrie, Korg, and Foster to stop Gorr the God Butcher from eliminating all gods.[11] Four or five drafts of the screenplay had been completed by mid-April 2020,[64] when Waititi said the sequel was \"so over the top now in the very best way\" and would make Ragnarok look like a \"run of the mill, very safe film\" by doubling down on its crazier aspects.[64][76] He wanted to up the ante and make the film as if \"10-year-olds told us what should be in a movie and we said yes to every single thing.\" Waititi added that the film would explore more of Korg's Kronan culture and indicated that it would include the Space Sharks alien race from the comics. He expressed interest in featuring the character Beta Ray Bill, but was unsure at that point if he would.[64]\n\nAt the end of July, Waititi said they had been writing the script off and on for over a year and he was taking another pass on it that week. He said it was very romantic, and explained that he wanted to make a romance film because he wanted to make something that he had not done before,[66][80] and, as such, wrote the film as a love story.[81] He later said the film was \"about love, with superheroes and outer space\", and that he wanted to \"embrace this thing that I was always a bit dismissive of, and explore this idea of love, and show characters who do believe in love\".[82] That October, Hemsworth said Waititi was still writing the script and expressed his excitement for doing something drastically different with his character, as he did in his previous three MCU films.[83] Waititi later described Love and Thunder as the craziest film he had ever made and explained that each element was intended to not make sense. He said it would have its own \"distinct flavour\" from Ragnarok,[84] which he called a 1970s space opera with a festive, party-like tone. He saw this film as a 1980s adventure, taking inspiration from posters for films such as Conan the Barbarian (1982) and The Beastmaster (1982) as well as art seen on vans in Venice Beach,[13] with the works of Jack Kirby and the cover of \"old\" Mills & Boon romance novels also serving as \"visual touchstones\" for the film.[81] He said it was not serious or dramatic, but it did explore themes such as love, loss, and \"our place in the world\" while making the characters ask themselves the questions: \"What is your purpose? What is the reason that you're a hero, and what do you do when you have these powers?\"[13] The film's ending involving Love underwent multiple revisions.[85]\n\nJames Gunn, the writer and director of the three Guardians of the Galaxy films, consulted on how the Guardians characters were used in Love and Thunder,[86] with Gunn and Waititi discussing where the characters were going before Waititi began writing. Waititi read Gunn's script for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023), which is set after Love and Thunder, and then Gunn read Waititi's script and shared his thoughts,[87] asking for some adjustments to be made.[88] In January 2021, Gunn said the Guardians were \"in great hands\" with Waititi,[86] and he later praised Waititi's work on the script.[89] Chris Pratt said Love and Thunder would continue the rivalry between Guardians leader Peter Quill / Star-Lord and Thor that was established in Infinity War and Endgame,[90] while Karen Gillan said Waititi brought out the \"bonkers side\" of Nebula through her \"pure aggression\".[91]\n\nPre-production began in Australia by October 2020.[24] A month later, Chris Pratt was revealed to be reprising his role as Guardians of the Galaxy leader Peter Quill / Star-Lord.[92] Given the ensemble nature of the cast, industry insiders described the film as feeling like \"Avengers 5\".[93] In December, Feige revealed that the film's release was delayed again, this time to May 6, 2022, and he announced that Bale would portray Gorr the God Butcher in the film.[94] Jaimie Alexander was also revealed to be reprising her MCU role in Love and Thunder, returning as Sif from the first two Thor films after not appearing in Ragnarok,[18][95][96] alongside other members and allies of the Guardians of the Galaxy: Pom Klementieff as Mantis,[97] Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, Karen Gillan as Nebula,[98] and Sean Gunn as Kraglin Obfonteri; Gunn also provides on set reference for Guardians member Rocket.[98][99] Matt Damon was set to appear, after making a cameo appearance in Ragnarok as an Asgardian actor playing Loki.[98][100] He received special permission to enter Australia, despite the country's strict travel restrictions during the pandemic, since Love and Thunder was providing jobs for Australians.[101] This prompted criticism as it was perceived that Damon, who traveled with his family, received preferential treatment to enter when many Australian nationals abroad were unable to return to the country.[100] Sam Neill—who appeared alongside Damon in Ragnarok as an actor playing Odin—said there was a good chance he would be in the film as well, as long as he could travel from New Zealand to Australia during the pandemic.[102]\n\nMayes C. Rubeo served as the film's costume designer, after doing so for Ragnarok.[103][104] For Love and Thunder, Rubeo focused on making clothes that reflect faithfully to the comics and fit Thor's mythology.[103] Making of Foster's costume required 10 set constructions.[105] Rubeo created Foster's costume \"based on the old comics\" while maintaining her heroic attributes, with advanced technology that was \"flexible and versatile\". As Portman was vegan, it was important to Rubeo that she make Foster's costume out of non-animal materials such as plastic and other synthetic materials. To differentiate Foster from Thor, Rubeo added \"silver metallic and deeper red hues\" to Foster's costume since Thor's one used \"new colors\", as well as her winged helmet.[103][104] Rubeo created 25 costumes for Hemsworth. These included many types of Thor's typical uniform which Rubeo integrated \"more vibrant colors, like reds, blues and metallic golds to match the exaggerated aesthetic of the film.\"[103][104] Thor's 1980s costume was influenced by Kurt Russell's character Jack Burton in Big Trouble in Little China (1986),[106] and his other costumes made more \"flashier\" compared to Foster's. Gorr's costume—unlike those of most of the characters in Love and Thunder, which were taken directly from the comics—was redesigned for the film, with Rubeo using classical sculptures as a source of inspiration for his outfit during the draping process. For a \"great contrast to vibrant colors\" used by other characters, Rubeo applied white to his costume rather than black, reflecting his supernatural nature.[103][104] Rubeo bought 50 yards (46 m) of linen to hide the costume's wire rigger and the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system; this prevented Bale from overheating. Leather masters Augusto and Giampaolo Grassi were hired to make a breastplate for Zeus' costume using gold leaf.[106]\n\nPrincipal photography began on January 26, 2021,[107] at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney,[57] under the working title The Big Salad.[108] Barry \"Baz\" Idoine serves as the cinematographer,[109] after previously working with Waititi on the Disney+ Star Wars series  The Mandalorian (2019–present).[110] Filming was delayed from an initial August 2020 start date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[57][66] Industrial Light & Magic provided the same StageCraft virtual production technology used on The Mandalorian which Waititi directed an episode of, creating a custom volume space at Fox Studios Australia. It featured more LED panels and offered a higher resolution than the original volume created for The Mandalorian.[111] Waititi also used Satellite Lab's PlateLight technology (after previously using their Dynamiclight technology on Ragnarok), which is a special rig designed to capture multiple lighting set-ups simultaneously within a single shot at a high frame rate, allowing Waititi to select which lighting set up he would like in post-production.[112] Waititi believed he was able to shoot Love and Thunder more efficiently than Ragnarok due to already having experience working on a Marvel Studios film.[13]\n\nFilming occurred at Centennial Park in Sydney in early February,[113] with Klementieff, Gillan, Bautista, and Pratt completing their scenes shortly afterward.[114][115][116] In early March, set photos revealed Damon and Neill were reprising their roles as the Asgardian actors playing Loki and Odin, along with Luke Hemsworth in his Ragnarok role as the actor playing Thor. Melissa McCarthy was also revealed to be portraying an actress playing Hela alongside her husband Ben Falcone in an undisclosed role; these cameos were for a sequence where actors reenact scenes from Ragnarok.[29] Damon filmed his part over two days.[101] Alexander completed filming her scenes by the end of the month,[117] while Goldblum was confirmed to appear as the Grandmaster,[118] and Russell Crowe was revealed to be appearing in the film in what was described as a \"fun cameo\".[119] Crowe finished filming his scenes in late April, around which time it was confirmed that he would play Zeus in the film.[21] Crowe was originally set to play Satan in the film before his character was changed to Zeus.[120] Septimus Caton would later be cast as Satan and had makeup and prosthetic tests done, but the character does not appear in the film.[16] At the beginning of May, Waititi said there were four weeks left of shooting,[121] while Idoine said he would continue work on the film through the end of 2021.[110] Filming wrapped on June 1, 2021,[122] by which point Neill had revealed that singer Jenny Morris would appear in the film,[123] making a cameo as a New Asgard citizen.[20] Goldblum and Peter Dinklage, who was set to reprise his role as Eitri from Infinity War, had their scenes cut from the theatrical release,[42] as did Lena Headey, who was approached by Waititi for a role in the film.[43]\n\nWaititi said in early June 2021 that post-production would be completed by February 2022.[124] Later in June, Diesel was confirmed to be reprising his voice role as Groot.[125] In October 2021, the film's release date was delayed to July 8, 2022,[126] while Simon Russell Beale was revealed to have been cast in an undisclosed role that was subsequently confirmed to be the Olympian god Dionysus,[127][20] though the scene Beale appeared in was ultimately cut from the final film and the actor was relegated to an extra role in Love and Thunder.[128] Additional photography for the film took place in early 2022.[129] At the start of March, further reshoots were revealed to be happening \"in the coming weeks\",[130] and were said to have begun with Bale by the week of March 18.[129][131] The teaser trailer released in April confirmed that Bradley Cooper would be reprising his MCU role as the voice of Rocket in the film,[11] and Akosia Sabet was revealed to be appearing as the goddess Bast the following month.[35] Following the appearance of Brett Goldstein in the film's mid-credits scene as Hercules, Waititi revealed in July 2022 that Feige \"really wanted him\" to be cast for that role.[132]\n\nAdditional characters appearing in the film include: Falligar the Behemoth, one of the gods slain by Gorr;[133] the cosmic wish-granting entity Eternity;[134] Thor's magical goats Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder, based on the Norse mythological animals Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr;[135] and Warsong, Valkyrie's winged steed.[136] The latter was renamed from Aragorn as in the comics to Warsong for Love and Thunder, after previously appearing unnamed in Ragnarok and Endgame.[137] Waititi had planned to have Jesus make a cameo appearance as part of a cutaway gag in the Omnipotence City sequence, after Valkyrie mentioned a \"God of Carpentry\".[138] The character Cyttorak was considered to appear in the film as one of the deities seen in Omnipotent City, but the idea was scrapped.[139] Storyboards by artist Anthony Lee Winn for Love and Thunder suggest that the characters Galactus, Fin Fang Foom, and Shuma-Gorath were also considered for inclusion in the film; Shuma-Gorath previously appeared in the MCU film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) under the name Gargantos.[140] Visual effects for the film were created by Wētā FX, Rising Sun Pictures, Framestore, Industrial Light & Magic, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, Raynault VFX, Base FX, EDI Effetti Digitali Italiani, Mammal Studios, Fin Design + Effects, and Cinesite.[141] Matthew Schmidt, Peter S. Elliot, Tim Roche, and Jennifer Vecchiarello served as the film's editors,[109] while Jake Morrison served as the visual effects supervisor.[141] Perception designed the film's main-on-end title sequence, drawing inspiration from 1980s rock band logos and designing approximately 250 custom fonts for the sequence.[142]\n\nIn December 2021, Michael Giacchino revealed that he would be scoring the film; he previously scored Doctor Strange (2016) and the MCU Spider-Man trilogy for Marvel Studios, as well as Waititi's previous film Jojo Rabbit (2019).[143] A soundtrack album, featuring Giacchino's original themes along with the score composed by him and Nami Melumad, was released by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on July 6, 2022. The single \"Mama's Got a Brand New Hammer\", the film's main suite, was released on June 30.[144][145] Waititi wanted the music to reflect the same aesthetic of the film with its \"bombastic, loud, colorful palette\". \"Sweet Child o' Mine\" by Guns N' Roses is featured in the film, given Guns N' Roses is one of Waititi's favorite bands, and helped \"reflect the sort of crazy adventure that we're [visually] presenting\";[146] the song was also used in the film's marketing.[147] The film features the song \"Rainbow in the Dark\" by Dio, according to Wendy Dio, widow of band member Ronnie James Dio.[148]\n\nLego sets and Hasbro figures based on the film were revealed in February 2022,[149] with additional Lego sets and Funko Pops revealed that April.[150] The teaser trailer was released on April 18,[11] and commentators discussed its ending, which debuted Portman's Foster in the Mighty Thor costume and wielding a restored version of Thor's hammer Mjolnir. Marco Vito Oddo of Collider and Ryan Parker from The Hollywood Reporter highlighted the use of \"Sweet Child o' Mine\", which Oddo felt indicated Waititi would \"keep the hard rock aesthetics that helped Thor: Ragnarok become a huge success\", while Parker called it a \"bright, stylish, fun trailer [that] sets a tone for the film in true Taika Waititi form\".[151][147][152] Justin Harp of Digital Spy felt the humor from Ragnarok was \"clearly back in this film too\",[153] while Tom Power of TechRadar felt the trailer was a \"superhero, intergalactic glam rock feast for the senses\" and contained intriguing footage that did a good job of teasing the film.[154] Both The Ringer's Daniel Chin and Empire's Sophie Butcher highlighted the trailer's focus on Thor's journey of self-discovery as well as the lack of footage of Bale's Gorr. Chin remarked that the trailer was \"dedicated to catching up with Thor as he rediscovers himself\", and was excited for Portman's performance as Foster. He thought the trailer was a \"far cry from the Thor we witnessed over a decade ago, as the franchise has transformed into a full-blown space comedy\". Butcher felt the trailer's introspection was not surprising due to the film being set after Endgame, and said the trailer was brief but exciting.[155][156] The trailer had 209 million global views in its first 24 hours, becoming the seventh most viewed trailer in that time period.[157]\n\nA second trailer was released on May 23, during Game 4 of the 2022 NBA Eastern Conference finals.[158] Many commentators highlighted Bale's appearance as Gorr the God Butcher in the trailer.[158][159][160] Eric Francisco of Inverse noted the similar comedic tone from Ragnarok while adding \"some darker shades\" with the inclusion of Gorr. He said Bale brought an \"absolutely terrifying vision of Gorr the God Butcher to the screen\", adding that it appears Hemsworth was ready to pass the mantle of Thor to Portman.[159] Jennifer Ouellette of Ars Technica noted that Gorr's scenes featured a different color palette, being shown in \"primarily gray tones\", which she felt made the contrast between other characters \"more stark\".[160] Zach Seemayer from Entertainment Tonight felt that it \"gives fans everything they've been hoping for from the brief flashes of important moments from the first trailer in April\", citing scenes featuring Portman's the Mighty Thor, Thor \"living up to his 'Space Viking' title\", and Gorr's footage.[161] Similarly, The A.V. Club's Sam Barsanti and William Hughes also highlighted Portman and Hemsworth's Thor, Gorr's appearance, and other comedic moments in the trailer, such as when Thor is nude after Crowe's Zeus exposes his disguise.[162] Scott Mendelson of Forbes called the trailer \"the real deal\" compared to the teaser, and noted similarities with the Masters of the Universe franchise. He speculated that Thor and Foster would be \"pining\" for each other despite it being 11 years after their first encounter, and called it \"a little depressing\", as he hoped the two \"A+ dating specimens would have moved on\". He also highlighted how Gorr's scenes played with color and contrast, and the \"interplay\" between Foster and Valkyrie.[163] Footage from the film was also featured in the 2022 CineEurope presentation.[164]\n\nUlta Beauty partnered with Marvel Studios to create a makeup collection based on the film.[165] On July 9, 2022, Waititi and Thompson appeared on Vanity Fair's Notes on a Scene series, analysing the \"Taste the Rainbow\" scene.[166] The video was met with criticism for what some viewers perceived as Waititi and Thompson \"mocking\" the visual effects, on the same day that multiple VFX artists who worked for Marvel had spoken out against being \"underpaid\" and \"overworked\" by the studio's productions.[167]\n\nThor: Love and Thunder premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 23, 2022.[168][169] The film was theatrically released in Australia on July 6, 2022,[170] in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and New Zealand on July 7,[171][170] and in the United States on July 8, 2022,[126] in 4DX, RealD 3D, IMAX, ScreenX, and Dolby Cinema.[172] It was previously set for release on November 5, 2021,[7] but was delayed to February 18, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[63] It was then moved up a week to February 11 once Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was rescheduled from November 2021 to March 2022,[65] and delayed once again to May 6, 2022, in December 2020,[94][65] before shifting to the July 2022 date in October 2021.[126] It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[173] The El Capitan Theatre hosted two sensory inclusive screenings of the film in July 2022, featuring expedited check in, a \"calming\" lobby, reduced capacity, and gift bags for guests with items to aid with anxiety.[174]\n\nThe film was not released in Malaysia,[175] Brunei,[176] Kuwait,[177] Bahrain,[178] Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Oman, Qatar,[179] and Jordan[180] due to containing LGBT elements. Variety reported that the Malaysian release did not happen because Disney refused to make cuts to the film requested by the Film Censorship Board of Malaysia.[175] The Malaysian government confirmed that this was due to LGBT elements not being cut from the film.[181]\n\nThor: Love and Thunder was released on Disney+ on September 8, 2022, part of Disney+ Day,[182] with the option to view the theatrical version of the film or an IMAX Enhanced version.[183] It was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on September 27. The home media includes audio commentary, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and various behind-the-scenes featurettes.[184] According to the streaming aggregator JustWatch, Thor: Love and Thunder was the 3rd most streamed film in the United States in 2022.[185]\n\nThor: Love and Thunder grossed $343.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $417.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $760.9 million.[4][5] It is the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2022.[186] The film's opening weekend earned $303.3 million globally, of which IMAX contributed $23 million, making it the third-largest July debut of all-time for the format.[187] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $103 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it ninth on their list of 2022's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[188]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $140–167 million from 4,375 theatres in its opening weekend, along with a total gross of $345–420 million.[189][190] The film earned $69.5 million on its first day, which included $29 million from Thursday night previews. This marked the second-highest opening day and preview night of 2022, behind fellow MCU film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, as well as the fifth-highest opening day ever for an MCU film.[3] Its opening weekend earned $144.2 million, which was the largest debut of the Thor franchise, the twelfth-largest for the MCU, and the third-largest for 2022, behind Multiverse of Madness ($187.4 million) and Jurassic World Dominion ($145 million). Of the $144.2 million figure, over $13.8 million came from IMAX, making it the fifth-highest July debut of all-time for the format domestically. Love and Thunder was also the sixth film in the COVID-19 pandemic to earn over 10 million theater admissions in its opening weekend.[191] Its second weekend grossed $46.6 million, a decline of nearly 68%, representing one of the MCU's largest sophomore weekend drops. Deadline Hollywood attributed this to its CinemaScore grade and generally mixed reception from critics and audiences.[192] In its third weekend the film made $22.6 million, finishing second behind newcomer Nope.[193]\n\nOutside of North America, Love and Thunder grossed $15.7 million from 17 markets on its opening day, surpassing the first-day overall results of Thor: Ragnarok (2017) by 39%.[194] Its weekend gross was $159.2 million from 47 markets, making it the MCU's ninth-largest overseas debut ever and the third-largest for any Hollywood film released in the COVID-19 pandemic. It surpassed Ragnarok's opening by 19%. IMAX contributed $9.2 million to the weekend, becoming the third-largest July debut ever overseas. It also set several pandemic box office milestones in its opening weekend, marking the second-highest pandemic opening in Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines, while earning the third-highest in numerous territories, including Brazil, Italy, Thailand, Singapore and Argentina.[195] As of July 24, 2022, the film's largest markets are the United Kingdom ($31.5 million), Australia ($25.5 million), Mexico ($23.2 million), South Korea ($22.3 million), and Brazil ($17.2 million).[196]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 63%, with an average rating of 6.4/10, based on 449 reviews. The site's critics consensus reads: \"In some ways, Thor: Love and Thunder feels like Ragnarok redux – but overall, it offers enough fast-paced fun to make this a worthy addition to the MCU.\"[197] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 64 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[198] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported 77% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend it.[191]\n\nIn early reactions to the film, Screen Rant noted that the performances from Christian Bale and Natalie Portman were praised.[199] Owen Gleiberman of Variety said there are \"many words to describe [Thor: Love and Thunder]\", stating \"comedy is all part of the package\" that made Ragnarok \"such a genuine Marvel wildflower.\" Gleiberman wrote that the film \"sustains its freshness\" to the end, although it started with a \"more awkward\" first act with the Guardians of the Galaxy. He also praised Gorr's characterization–a \"power[ful introduction]\"–and concluded the review by saying he felt \"moved\" by the end.[200] David Ehrlich of IndieWire praised the film for its light tone and humorous moments, writing that \"[Taika] Waititi continues to brighten up the Thor movies with his own flavor of wackiness, which is as welcome here as it was grating in Jojo Rabbit.\" However, he noted that the film \"is clouded by its uncertain place in the universe from the moment it starts\".[2] Nick Allen at RogerEbert.com gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating that it was \"more or less a victory lap for all that [Waititi] achieved with his previous Marvel film, the often hilarious, rousing, and plainly refreshing Thor: Ragnarok. And while it has too many familiar flourishes and jokes, this entertaining sequel is still a force for good, with enough visual ambition and heart in front of and behind the camera to stand on its own.\" He praised Natalie Portman's performance that \"conveys why it's great to see Jane again\" and Christian Bale's \"striking\" role that he considered as the \"closest we'll get to seeing him play Pennywise the Clown, with a dash of Voldemort, but tethered to the same humility [he] brings to his most human, humbled characters.\"[201]\n\nTodd Gilchrist at The A.V. Club graded the film 'B', feeling that it did \"[revisit] the cheeky, sentimental tone of the nearly universally beloved Thor: Ragnarok, and propels its eponymous hero into new adventures that bring full circle a journey that started with the very first, much-less-beloved Thor back in 2011.\" He praised Portman and Bale's performances, with the latter's character being considered \"the most interesting and sympathetic Marvel adversary since Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger in Black Panther\", and Waititi's \"distinctive imagery [in the film] that may disturb and upset some viewers\", outpacing Sam Raimi's accomplishments in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022).[202] Leah Greenblatt at Entertainment Weekly also gave a similar grade, feeling that although \"its cheerful melee of starry cameos, in-jokes, and Cliffs-Notes mythology, feels a lot like franchise fatigue, it also has frequent moments of gonzo charm, thanks largely to the Technicolor lunacy of writer-director [Waititi] and a cast that seems inordinately game to follow his lead.\"[203]\n\nDavid Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter stated, \"The movie feels weightless, flippant, instantly forgettable, sparking neither love nor thunder.\"[109] David Sims of The Atlantic felt the film delivered a \"usual lightning-streaked action and tossed-off gags, but this time, there's not enough heft behind the flashiness.\" He found it a \"hasty-feeling mess of a movie\" and \"disappointing given that it's directed by [Waititi]\", although he praised Bale's and Russell Crowe's performances.[204] David Fear of Rolling Stone felt the film was \"oddly unengaging; even the love and death aspects often feel like cold transmissions from distant sources.\" He saw it as a mess due to the \"collision of competing tones, subplots, conceptual big swings and chaos masquerading as pathos\".[205] Eric Francisco at Inverse found Chris Hemsworth's Thor in the film becoming \"meandering, left in the purgatory of a roundabout tale that makes some sense on paper but in execution fails to maintain viscosity\", feeling that Marvel \"doesn't know what to do with [the character] anymore.\" He felt that despite \"striv[ing] for an emotional story about loss and love, the movie gets in its own way with tiresome relentless comedy, distracted plotting, and uneven tone.\"[206] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, calling it \"one of the goofiest and least consequential sagas in MCU history—an allegedly wild and wacky but ultimately disappointing and disjointed chapter in the ongoing story of the God of Thunder, who seems to get more clueless with each passing movie.\"[207]\n\nAt the London premiere Q&A, in response to the question \"How gay will the film be?\" Waititi exclaimed that it would be \"super gay\"; critics and moviegoers who saw the film expressed disappointment that this statement was false and that Marvel queerbaited the audience.[208][209][210] Jade King of TheGamer felt expectations from queer audiences for prominent \"LGBTQ+ characters and themes\" in Thor: Love and Thunder were not met, writing that \"the film's creators have been out there talking up the LGBTQ+ representation when it isn't really a massive part of the experience. [...] it's time to temper your expectations and stop letting Marvel continue to queerbait us into disappointment.\"[211]\n\nIn June 2023, Hemsworth commented on the film's response, stating: \"I think we just had too much fun. It just became too silly. It's always hard being in the center of it and having any real perspective [...] you just don't know how people are going to respond.\"[212] He later reflected on his own performance, believing he had become \"a parody of [himself]\" with the improv and \"wackiness\" of the film, and that he \"didn’t stick the landing\".[213]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced.[226] The special on this film, \"The Making of Thor: Love and Thunder\", was released on Disney+ on September 8, 2022, part of Disney+ Day.[182]\n\nWaititi was unaware that the tagline \"Thor will return\" was added to the end of the film. Waititi was open to directing another Thor film if Hemsworth was also involved, stating the story would need to be \"something surprising and unexpected\", suggesting a low-budget road trip film with no fight scenes, similar to Nebraska (2013).[227] Hemsworth hoped that a future installment would have a \"drastically different tone\" that would \"close the book\" on the character.[228] In June 2023, Hemsworth said informal conversations had discussed potential ideas for future appearances for the character. He also explained that he would want to return to Thor if all creatives were able to find another way to reinvent the character again to keep the experience \"a little unpredictable\" in order to not become stale with audiences.[229] Waititi noted in Titan Books' Thor: Love and Thunder – The Official Movie Special Book, which was published in August 2023, that any additional Thor film would need to continue the character's evolution \"but still in a very fun way and still giving him things to come up against\" and would need to have a villain more powerful than Hela, who is featured in Ragnarok.[230] In November 2023, Waititi confirmed that he would not be involved with a fifth Thor film.[231]\n"

        "content": "\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever is a 2022 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Shuri / Black Panther. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to Black Panther (2018) and the 30th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the screenplay with Joe Robert Cole, the film stars Letitia Wright as Shuri / Black Panther, alongside Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Winston Duke, Florence Kasumba, Dominique Thorne, Michaela Coel, Mabel Cadena, Tenoch Huerta Mejía, Martin Freeman, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Angela Bassett. In the film, the leaders of Wakanda fight to protect their nation in the wake of King T'Challa's death.\n\nIdeas for a sequel began after the release of Black Panther in February 2018. Coogler negotiated to return as director in the following months, and Marvel Studios officially confirmed the sequel's development in mid-2019. Plans for the film changed in August 2020 when Black Panther star and T'Challa actor Chadwick Boseman died from colon cancer, with Marvel choosing not to recast his role. The return of other main cast members from the first film was confirmed that November, and the sequel's title was revealed to be Black Panther: Wakanda Forever in May 2021. Filming began in late June in Atlanta, taking place at both Trilith Studios and Tyler Perry Studios, before moving to Massachusetts in August, but was halted in November to allow Wright to recover from an injury sustained during filming. It resumed by mid-January 2022 and wrapped in late March in Puerto Rico.\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever premiered at the El Capitan Theatre and the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on October 26, 2022, and was released in the United States on November 11, as the final film in Phase Four of the MCU. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $859.2 million worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2022. Wakanda Forever and Bassett's performance received numerous awards and nominations, including five Academy Awards (winning Costume Design), one British Academy Film Award, six Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two), two Golden Globe Awards (winning one), and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. A sequel is in development.\n\nT'Challa, king of Wakanda, is suffering from a terminal illness which his sister Shuri believes can be cured by the \"heart-shaped herb\". Shuri attempts to synthetically recreate the herb after it was burned by Erik \"Killmonger\" Stevens,[a] but fails to do so before T'Challa dies.\n\nA year later, Wakanda is under pressure from other nations to share their vibranium, with some parties attempting to steal it by force. Queen Ramonda implores Shuri to continue her research on the herb, hoping to create a new Black Panther that will defend Wakanda, but she refuses due to her belief that the Black Panther is a figure of the past. In the Atlantic Ocean, the CIA and U.S. Navy SEALs use a vibranium detector to locate a potential vibranium deposit underwater. The expedition is killed by a group of blue-skinned, water-breathing superhumans led by Namor, with the CIA believing Wakanda to be responsible. Namor confronts Ramonda and Shuri, easily bypassing Wakanda's advanced security. Blaming Wakanda for the vibranium race, he gives them an ultimatum: deliver him the scientist responsible for the vibranium detector, or he will attack Wakanda.\n\nShuri and Okoye learn from CIA agent Everett K. Ross that the scientist in question is MIT student Riri Williams and arrive at the university to confront her. The group is pursued by the FBI and then by Namor's warriors, who defeat Okoye before taking Shuri and Williams underwater to meet Namor. Angered by Okoye's failure to protect Shuri, Ramonda strips her of her title as general of the Dora Milaje and seeks out Nakia, who has been living in Haiti since The Blip.[b] Namor shows Shuri his vibranium-rich underwater kingdom of Talokan, which he has protected for centuries from discovery by the world. Bitter at the surface world for enslaving the Maya, Namor proposes an alliance with Wakanda against the rest of the world but threatens to destroy Wakanda if they refuse. Nakia helps Shuri and Williams escape, killing a Talokanil guard in the process, and Namor retaliates with an attack against Wakanda, during which Ramonda drowns while saving Williams. Namor vows to return with his full army, and the citizens of Wakanda relocate to the Jabari mountains for their safety. Meanwhile, Ross is arrested by his ex-wife, CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, for secretly exchanging classified intelligence with the Wakandans.\n\nAfter Ramonda's funeral, Shuri uses a remnant of the herb that gave Namor's people their superhuman abilities to reconstruct the heart-shaped herb. She ingests it, gaining superhuman abilities and meeting Killmonger in the Ancestral Plane, who questions if she will seek revenge or be as honorable as T'Challa. Shuri dons a new Black Panther suit and is accepted by the other Wakandan tribes as the Black Panther. Despite M'Baku's urges for peace, Shuri is determined to exact vengeance on Namor for Ramonda's death and orders an immediate counterattack on Talokan. Preparing for battle, with Ayo assuming the position of general of the Dora Milaje, Shuri bestows the Midnight Angel armor upon Okoye, who in turn recruits Dora Milaje member Aneka to join her. Williams creates an Iron Man-esque powered exoskeleton to aid the Wakandans.\n\nUsing a seafaring vessel, the Wakandans lure Namor and his warriors to the surface with another vibranium detector as a battle ensues. Shuri traps Namor in a fighter aircraft, intending to dry him out and weaken him. The pair crash on a desert beach and fight. Shuri gains the upper hand but has a vision of Ramonda and implores Namor to yield, offering him a peaceful alliance. Namor accepts, and the battle ends. Namor's cousin, Namora, is upset at Namor's surrender, but he assures her that the new alliance will allow Talokan to become stronger. Williams returns to MIT, leaving her suit behind, while Okoye rescues Ross from captivity. Shuri plants more heart-shaped herbs to ensure the future of the Black Panther mantle. In Shuri's absence, M'Baku steps forward to challenge for the throne. Shuri visits Nakia in Haiti where she burns her funeral robe in accordance with Ramonda's wishes, allowing herself to finally grieve for T'Challa.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Shuri learns that Nakia and T'Challa had a son named Toussaint, whom Nakia has been raising in secret. Toussaint reveals his Wakandan name is T'Challa.\n\nAdditionally, Michael B. Jordan reprises his MCU role as N'Jadaka / Erik \"Killmonger\" Stevens, T'Challa and Shuri's cousin.[34] Returning from Black Panther are Isaach de Bankolé, Danny Sapani, and Dorothy Steel (in her final, posthumous role) as the Wakandan River Tribe,[35] Border Tribe,[36] and Merchant Tribe elders,[37] respectively; Connie Chiume reprises her role as Zawavari, previously the Mining Tribe Elder, but now the Elder Statesman, taking over the role held by Zuri in the first film;[36] and comedian Trevor Noah also reprises his voice role as Shuri's A.I. Griot.[38] Alex Livinalli portrays the Talokanil warrior Attuma,[14] while María Mercedes Coroy portrays Princess Fen, Namor's mother.[39] Lake Bell—who previously voiced Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow in the Disney+ animated series What If...? (2021–2024)—and Robert John Burke appear as Dr. Graham and Smitty, respectively, a pair of CIA officials in charge of the vibranium mining operation.[40][41] Richard Schiff appears as the U.S. Secretary of State,[42] while Kamaru Usman appears as a naval officer.[43][44] Archival footage from previous MCU films of Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther is used in the film's ending,[45] with Divine Love Konadu-Sun appearing as T'Challa II / Toussaint, T'Challa and Nakia's son.[46] CNN news anchor Anderson Cooper appears as himself reporting on the Wakandan activities.[47]\n\nWith the release of Black Panther in February 2018, producer Kevin Feige said there were \"many, many stories\" to tell about the character, and he wanted director and co-writer Ryan Coogler to return for any sequel;[48] Marvel Studios wanted to keep the creative team as intact as possible,[49] while Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn, despite feeling it was too early to discuss a sequel, was also positive about the desire to have Coogler return as director.[50] Coogler wanted to see how Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa / Black Panther would grow as a king in future Black Panther films, since his reign had only recently begun in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in contrast to the comics, where he was king since childhood.[51] In March 2018, Feige said there was nothing specific to reveal about a sequel, but Marvel had ideas and a \"pretty solid direction\" on where they wanted to take a second film.[52] That month, Boseman's agent Michael Greene was in negotiations for the actor to return as T'Challa in two planned Black Panther sequels for a reported pay of $10 million and $20 million, respectively.[53] By October, Coogler had closed a deal to write and direct a sequel to Black Panther. Despite both Marvel and Coogler having always intended to work together again after the first film's success, Coogler avoided rushing into a deal. Negotiations with Coogler were completed \"under the radar\" in the months following the first film's release. He was expected to begin writing the sequel in 2019, ahead of a planned filming start in late 2019 or early 2020.[49]\n\nIn November 2018, Letitia Wright was confirmed to be reprising her role of T'Challa's sister Shuri for the sequel.[6] When Angela Bassett, who played Ramonda in Black Panther, was asked if the main cast would return for the sequel, her husband Courtney B. Vance said they would. He said this included Michael B. Jordan as N'Jadaka / Erik \"Killmonger\" Stevens, who was killed in the first film, and Bassett agreed.[54] Feige dismissed Vance's statement in June 2019 as \"pure rumor\", saying there were no set plans for the film as Coogler had just begun outlining it and had not yet shared his plans with Feige or co-producer Nate Moore.[55] The next month, John Kani expressed interest in reprising his role as T'Challa's father T'Chaka in the film,[56] and Danai Gurira stated that Coogler had confirmed she would be reprising her role of Okoye in the sequel.[10] Feige confirmed the sequel's development at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con,[57] while Martin Freeman confirmed in August that he would reprise his role as Everett K. Ross in the sequel.[31] A release date of May 6, 2022, was announced at D23 along with the placeholder title Black Panther II.[58] Feige said Coogler had completed a script treatment for the film that included a villain and new title.[59] At the end of 2019, Ruth E. Carter confirmed that she would be returning from the first film as the costume designer for the sequel, and said that she was set to begin work on it in \"the fall\".[60] Feige, Boseman, and Coogler discussed adapting elements of Boseman's more \"Gung ho\" performance as an alternate universe variant of T'Challa in the episode \"What If... T'Challa Became a Star-Lord?\" from the first season of the Disney+ animated series What If...? (2021) for the film.[61]\n\nChadwick Boseman was an immensely talented actor and an inspirational individual who affected all of our lives professionally and personally. His portrayal of T'Challa the Black Panther is iconic and transcends any iteration of the character in any other medium from Marvel's past. And it's for that reason that we will not recast the character.\n\nOn August 28, 2020, Boseman died from colon cancer. Coogler stated that he had been unaware of Boseman's illness, and had spent the last year \"preparing, imagining and writing words for him to say [in the film] that we weren't destined to see\".[63] Feige and other executives at Marvel Studios were also unaware of Boseman's illness. Boseman, who had become thinner from his illness in the weeks prior to his death, had been prepared to begin gaining the weight back in September 2020 ahead of filming the sequel in March 2021. According to The Hollywood Reporter, industry observers felt Disney could recast the role, but that might generate a \"fan outcry\" and prompt comparisons between actors. Another suggestion was for Disney to shift their plans and have Shuri take on the mantle of the Black Panther, which occurred in the comic books.[64] By the time of Boseman's death, Coogler was in the middle of writing the script and had already turned in a draft.[65][66] In mid-November, executive producer Victoria Alonso said a digital double of Boseman would not be created for the film, and added that Marvel was taking their time to work out what they were going to do next and how.[67] Later in the month, Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, and Bassett were confirmed to be reprising their roles for the sequel as Nakia, M'Baku, and Ramonda, respectively, while Tenoch Huerta was in talks for an antagonist role.[7] At that time, filming was expected to begin in June or July 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia.[7][68]\n\nIn December 2020, the film's release date was moved back to July 8, 2022. Feige also confirmed that the role of T'Challa would not be recast, and said the sequel would explore the world and characters of the first film as a way to honor the legacy that Boseman helped build.[62] He would later reaffirm that visual effects would not be used to include Boseman in the film,[69] and also said it \"felt like it was much too soon to recast\" noting how the world outside and within the MCU was still processing the loss of Boseman.[70] By the end of the month, Boseman's makeup designer Siân Richards was set to return for the sequel, while his personal costumer Craig Anthony said he would not commit to the film due to Boseman's death. Hair designer Deidra Dixon was unsure if she would return following Boseman's death, as well as the death of her sister.[53] Feige said in January 2021 that the primary focus of the sequel was always about further exploring the characters and \"different subcultures\" of Wakanda.[69] That same month, Jordan said he was willing to reprise his role as Killmonger as he felt returning to the MCU would \"always be on the table in some capacity\" due to his love for the character and for working with Coogler.[71] In February, Daniel Kaluuya said he was unsure if he would reprise his role of W'Kabi;[72] he ultimately did not due to scheduling conflicts with Jordan Peele's Universal Pictures film Nope (2022).[73] The sequel, however, establishes that W'Kabi was banished from Wakanda following the events of Black Panther.[74]\n\nIn March 2021, Coogler said he was still writing the script, and described working on the film without Boseman as the hardest thing he had ever done in his career. He added that Boseman had held together the first film, and now as the director, he was the one trying to keep it going.[65][75] He was able to reuse many elements of his planned film before Boseman's death while incorporating and applying \"the themes that the people who were hurting just as much as me could actually perform and execute and come out on the other side whole\".[17] According to Coogler, the original version of the script would have explored T'Challa dealing with resuming life after the Blip \"grieving the loss of time... after being gone for five years\",[76] and involved T'Challa's relationship with his and Nakia's son T'Challa II / Toussaint, who he never met because of the Blip. Coogler also said that Namor and Valentina Allegra de Fontaine were in the original script, with de Fontaine having a larger role compared to the final film.[77] Wright added that Shuri would have become Black Panther alongside T'Challa.[78] Freeman said he would soon meet with Coogler to discuss the project.[66] In April, Coogler wrote an op-ed in which he said the film would still shoot in Georgia despite the state passing its controversial Election Integrity Act of 2021 law. Though Coogler did not support the bill, he felt that boycotting film production in the state would have a negative effect on the people who otherwise would have been employed by the film. He instead planned to raise awareness of how to overturn the bill.[79] Nyong'o expressed excitement for Coogler's plans and how everyone involved was dedicated to continuing Boseman's legacy,[80] later saying that Coogler had reshaped his ideas for the film to respect Boseman, which she felt was \"spiritually and emotionally correct\" to do.[81] Moore described the film as \"how you move forward while dealing with a tragic loss. All of the characters, both old and new, are dealing with how loss can affect your actions in ways that are emotional and surprising\".[8]\n\nThe film continues exploring feminist themes from the first film, with Nyong'o saying the film would tackle the \"beliefs, passions, loves and arguments\" of the women characters, creating \"a robust drama\". She also felt that Wakanda was a \"world we are striving to get to\".[82] The film introduces Namor to the MCU, while changing his homeworld from the comics, Atlantis, to Talokan,[17][20] a decision made by Coogler to avoid comparisons with previous adaptations of the legendary Atlantis seen in works such as Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001) and Aquaman (2018).[83] Talokan—named after Tlālōcān, a realm described in several Aztec codices as a paradise ruled by the deity Tlāloc and his consort Chalchiuhtlicue—is a \"lavish\", hidden, underwater Mesoamerican civilization that was inspired by ancient Maya culture,[8][83] with the association between Atlantis and Mesoamerica coming from the book Atlantis: The Antediluvian World (1882) by Ignatius L. Donnelly.[84] The creatives worked closely with Mayan historians and experts to portray Talokan in the film.[8] Coogler noted Talokan was similar to Wakanda in that it was also an advanced civilization \"hiding in plain sight\",[17] with Moore stating the two \"often find themselves in conflict because they're not dissimilar. They are these nations that would prefer to be hidden and isolated, with monarchs who are incredibly powerful and have strong points of view about how the world should be\". Hannah Beachler returned from the first film as production designer, noting she did a \"deep dive\" to portray this version of Atlantis in the film; she was visually inspired by the films Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), and Jack Kirby's comic imagery.[8] Several cast members, as well as Coogler, learned to swim for the film.[85] The hand gesture that the Talokan people (Talokanil) use to greet each other throughout the film, in which their hands open and fold in a way that resembles the jaws of a sea creature, was suggested by Huerta along with Mabel Cadena and Alex Livinalli as it was not part of the script, and was inspired by similar gestures depicted in the Codex Zouche-Nuttall document.[86] Coogler had envisioned Namor as a potential antagonist for a future Black Panther film while working on the first film, and requested Marvel Studios not allow the character to be used in any MCU projects before the second film.[87]\n\nMore than 2,000 outfits were designed by Carter for the film.[88] The process of creating Namor's costume began about a year before production on the film had started, with Coogler asking several artists to help design the character's outfit; most of them initially submitted drawings that were reminiscent of the costume by comic book artist John Romita Sr. that debuted in Sub-Mariner #67 (November 1973),[89][90] but their ideas were rejected in favor of a design by then-Marvel Studios visual development artist Anthony Francisco, who was inspired by the character's original green swim briefs-clad look.[91] Carter worked closely with Marvel's visual development team and art department to design Shuri's Black Panther costume, sketching out ideas based on the character's appearances in the comics.[88] Carter adorned Shuri's costume with a combination of gold and silver elements that she felt would highlight the character's femininity, wanting the costume's design to stay close to Shuri's \"form, the silhouette of a woman, with a bust and hips and shoulders\" while also trying to \"delicately enhance the dynamic figure of the Panther suit\".[92] Costume company Film Illusions developed the material Carter used to create the Midnight Angels costumes.[88] Carter said Ramonda's outfit has a \"strong presence of metal\", featuring a collar that was 3D printed and painted to look like metal.[92] For the Talokanil costumes, Carter sought advice from Mesoamerican historians and experts, as well as oceanographers and marine biologists.[88] She incorporated jade and aquatic elements, and referenced sea creatures in their headdresses,[8] such as Namora's, which resembles the fins of a lionfish, and Attuma's, which resembles the skull of a hammerhead shark.[88] Many of the costumes needed to be tested in water given the amount of underwater filming that occurred,[8] with Carter stating, \"Clothes aren't meant to be worn underwater for eight hours and used again the next day. We had to rethink everything about what fibers could go in water and still look organic. We'd like to think clothes look like ballet all the time in water, but they just rise up\".[92]\n\nIn May 2021, Marvel Studios revealed the film's title as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,[93] which Ethan Anderton of /Film believed was a fitting tribute to Boseman since \"Wakanda Forever\" is the battle cry of the Wakandans.[94] According to Moore, hundreds of different subtitles were considered for the second Black Panther film, such as Kingdom of the Deep in reference to Talokan, with Wakanda Forever originally intended to be used as the subtitle for a potential third Black Panther film before the creative team decided to use it for the second film, which Moore felt was the \"right\" decision, describing the project as a \"story about legacy, it's a story about persistence, and Wakanda Forever says all of those things\".[95] By the end of that month, Freeman said he had read the script and expressed excitement for it.[96] At the end of June, Edgar Luna, the business development manager of Worcester, Massachusetts's Economic Development Office, said the technical department of Wakanda Forever was in the city the week of June 25 to scout and inspect filming locations, including at the Worcester Police Department headquarters.[97][98]\n\nProduction started at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 29, 2021,[100] under the working title Summer Break.[101] Prior to Boseman's death, filming had been set to start in March 2021.[64] At the start of filming, Feige announced that \"everyone\" from the first film was expected to return.[100] Autumn Durald Arkapaw serves as the cinematographer, after doing so on the Disney+ television series Loki (2021–2023), replacing the first film's cinematographer Rachel Morrison.[102] A long time collaborator of Coogler's, Morrison planned to return for Wakanda Forever but was unable to due to a scheduling conflict with her film Flint Strong (2024) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[103] Discussing the use of anamorphic lenses as opposed to spherical lenses, Coogler explained that anamorphic lenses \"warp the image a little bit\", which fit with the film having \"the fog of loss over it\"; a \"profound loss... can warp how you look at the world\".[17] Arkapaw used Panavision T Series anamorphic lenses which were specifically modified by Panavision.[104] Wright, Gurira, Nyong'o, and Kasumba bonded together on set while dealing with their grief for Boseman's death, with Wright and Gurira particularly connecting through taking walks together. Gurira described feeling emotional while entering the throne set, as she remembered filming scenes with Boseman during the first film and said that Coogler helped her process her grief.[82]\n\nBassett said in July that the screenplay was still undergoing changes due to Boseman's death, and had gone through at least five incarnations. She also indicated that the first film's co-writer Joe Robert Cole was contributing to the sequel,[105] which Feige soon confirmed.[106] Michaela Coel joined the cast in an undisclosed role.[107] In August, Isaach de Bankolé was set to reprise his role as the Wakandan River Tribe elder,[35] and Dominique Thorne began filming scenes for Wakanda Forever as Riri Williams before starring as that character in the Disney+ miniseries Ironheart (2025).[108] Thorne previously auditioned for the role of Shuri in Black Panther.[109] Filming that month was expected to take place at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and in Worcester,[98][110] with the production preparing to film a car chase in Worcester by August 18.[98][111] A chase scene was filmed in the Ernest A. Johnson Tunnel on August 23 and 24.[112] On August 25, Wright was temporarily hospitalized with what were believed to be minor injuries sustained in an accident while filming a stunt in Boston.[113] Wright went to her home in London for recovery in September while filming continued to shoot around her character.[114] Dorothy Steel, who portrayed the Wakandan Merchant Tribe elder in the first film, died on October 15; she was in the middle of reprising her role for the sequel when she died.[37][115]\n\nIn late October, the film's release was delayed to November 11, 2022.[116] The production moved to the Mary Ross Waterfront Park in Brunswick, Georgia by October 22,[117][118] where filming occurred from October 28 to November 2.[118] Michael Torras, the manager of the Brunswick Landing Marina, said a 300-foot cruise ship would join the production in the following days, and most of the filming occurred on the water. Matthew Hill, Brunswick's downtown development authority director, said most of the scenes were shot at night.[119] By November 5, filming of the scenes that did not require Wright was completed,[114] before the production went on hiatus on November 19. This was to accommodate Wright's fractured shoulder and a concussion, which were more serious than initially determined, and was not expected to affect the film's release date.[114][99] The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) implemented new rules on November 8 requiring non-U.S. citizens to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and provide proof of vaccination before traveling to the country. The Hollywood Reporter noted that this could present an issue for Wright's return to filming in Atlanta since she is not a U.S. citizen and was reportedly not vaccinated.[120] In mid-December, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that filming would resume in late January 2022 in Atlanta with Wright involved;[121] Feige, Moore, and executive producer Louis D'Esposito confirmed upon the start of the hiatus that Wright was the film's new lead.[99]\n\nFilming resumed by mid-January 2022, with a recovered Wright returning, and was expected to continue for four weeks.[122][123] Filming was originally scheduled to resume on January 10 but was delayed by a week after cast and crew members, including Nyong'o, tested positive for COVID-19. At that time, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Duke had negotiated a pay raise for his return because of his character's expanded role in the sequel.[123] The following month, Nyong'o revealed that Danny Sapani would be reprising his role as the Wakandan Border Tribe elder in the film.[36] Thorne completed filming her scenes by March 13.[124] Additional photography began on March 18, in Puerto Rico, where filming officially wrapped on March 24.[125][126]\n\nIn June 2022, Huerta confirmed that he was appearing in the film,[28] and he was officially announced to be playing Namor at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con the next month,[127] when Coel, Cadena, and Livinalli were also revealed to be respectively playing Aneka, Namora, and Attuma, and Florence Kasumba was confirmed to be reprising her role as Ayo.[14] Damian Priest said that he had been offered a role in the film, which was reported to have been Attuma, as well as Namor.[128] Reshoots occurred with the cast following their appearance at Comic-Con. Huerta said the reshoots were intended to add \"little missing pieces\" to the film.[129] In late July, it was reported that Kamaru Usman had been cast in the film for a role that was subsequently confirmed to be a cameo appearance as a naval officer,[43][44] while Richard Schiff was revealed to be cast in September,[130] playing the U.S. Secretary of State in the film.[42] Lake Bell, who previously voiced alternate universe variants of Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow in What If...?, was revealed to be appearing in the film in late October.[40] In early November, María Mercedes Coroy confirmed that she had been cast as Namor's mother Fen in the film.[39] By the middle of the month, Jordan and Julia Louis-Dreyfus were revealed to be reprising their MCU roles as Killmonger and Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in the film.[34][32] Additionally, Robert John Burke was revealed to have been cast in the film; both him and Bell were confirmed to be playing a pair of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officials named Smitty and Graham, respectively.[40][41]\n\nArchival footage of Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther from previous MCU films is used at the end of Wakanda Forever.[45] Unlike most MCU films that include both mid-credits and post-credits scenes, Wakanda Forever features only one scene: it shows Shuri being introduced to her nephew T'Challa II / Toussaint, who was played by Divine Love Konadu-Sun.[131] Moore said the creative team did not consider including an additional scene after the credits in the film at any point during its production, as they \"felt the ending was so kind of poetic\" that they thought it would be \"a little disingenuous tonally\" to do so, with Moore calling the film \"an emotional experience\" that—similar to Avengers: Endgame (2019)—\"didn't need a stinger at the end\".[132][133] Wright said only two other children auditioned for the role of T'Challa II besides Konadu-Sun.[134] Several characters were considered to take on the mantle of Black Panther in the film, including Nakia and M'Baku, before Shuri was chosen.[135] Aaron Toney, who served as fight coordinator on Wakanda Forever, confirmed that Namor's ankle wings are capable of growing back after a scene in the film showed one of them being cut off by Shuri.[136] There had been discussions regarding the inclusion of a romance between Shuri and Namor in the film, but the idea was scrapped.[137]\n\nMichael P. Shawver returned as editor from the first film,[138] while Geoffrey Baumann served as the visual effects supervisor. The visual effects for Wakanda Forever were provided by Digital Domain, Industrial Light & Magic, Wētā FX, Cinesite, Rise FX, SSVFX, and Storm Studios.[139] 2,233 out of the film's 2,548 shots involved the use of visual effects, which were created by more than a dozen VFX vendors.[140] Perception designed the film's main-on-end title sequence, which depicts Shuri's funeral clothes being burned to reveal a Black Panther suit underneath. The sequence was filmed practically using a specialized fireproof Panavision camera, with Perception igniting controlled flames on cloth similar to the fabric worn by Shuri in the film.[141] Sound editors Steve Boeddeker and Benny Burtt, who both worked on the film, used the sound of rattlesnakes for Namor's ankle wings, an idea Coogler suggested about two weeks before sound editing was completed.[142] In late November 2022, Wētā FX supervisor Chris White revealed that Marvel Studios created a 200-page Talokan bible for the film that contains details about the kingdom such as its history, battle strategies, tools built, architecture, influence, and other elements.[143][144] The next month, Shawver revealed that the film originally had a four-and-a-half-hour cut that included additional scenes featuring Talokan and the developing relationship between Shuri and Williams, as well as a subplot involving the two of them teaming up with Namor to accomplish an unspecified task. Shawver attributed the reduced cut of the film to changes in its \"pacing\", and added that the removal of that material caused the film's narrative to be reworked, which was done during reshoots.[138]\n\nIn September 2021, it was revealed that Ludwig Göransson was set to return as composer for Wakanda Forever from the first film.[145] His score was released by Hollywood Records on November 11, 2022.[146]\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever Prologue, a soundtrack extended play, was released by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on July 25, 2022, and includes Tems' cover of Bob Marley's \"No Woman, No Cry\", which was used in the film's teaser trailer, \"A Body, A Coffin\" by Amaarae, and \"Soy\" by Santa Fe Klan. Göransson produced all three songs, and co-wrote \"A Body, A Coffin\" with Amaarae, Kyu Steed, KZ, Cracker Mallo, and Maesu.[147] In late October 2022, it was announced that the film's lead single would be \"Lift Me Up\" by Rihanna, written by Tems, Göransson, Rihanna, and Coogler, as a tribute to Boseman. The single marks Rihanna's first solo musical output since 2016 and was released on October 28, through Westbury Road, Roc Nation, Def Jam Recordings, and Hollywood Records. Tems stated she wanted to write a song that \"portrays a warm embrace from all the people that I've lost in my life\".[148] \"Lift Me Up\" was featured on the film's soundtrack, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever – Music from and Inspired By, which was released on November 4, 2022, by Roc Nation, Def Jam Recordings, and Hollywood Records.[148][146]\n\nVoices Rising: The Music of Wakanda Forever, a three-part documentary series detailing the creation process of Wakanda Forever's soundtrack, had its first episode released on Disney+ on February 28, 2023.[149][150] In the first episode, \"Nigeria: Past Is Present\", Coogler and Göransson work in Lagos, Nigeria to incorporate the sounds of traditional music along with contemporary artists such as Fireboy DML, Bloody Civilian, and Busiswa into the score.[150] The second episode, \"Mexico: Con La Brisa\",[151] sees Göransson working in Mexico to once again blend traditional music and instruments alongside modern artists such as Foudeqush, Vivir Quintana, and Mare Advertencia, to create the sound of Namor and the Talokan people.[152] The third episode, \"London: Bring It Home\",[151] sees Göransson recording the orchestra for the score at the Abbey Road Studios in London in mid-2022, while working to infuse it with the elements he recorded in Mexico and Nigeria alongside artists including Jorja Smith and Burna Boy.[152] Göransson also collaborates again with Senegalese singer Baba Maal, who returned from the first film to provide vocals.[citation needed] The series was produced by Actual Films, JM Films, and Proximity Media.[153] The series was originally scheduled to be removed from Disney+ on May 26, 2023, as part of Disney's efforts to reduce content costs, but it was ultimately decided that it would remain on the service at that time.[154]\n\nThe first footage from the film was shown in a sizzle reel of Disney's upcoming films during the studio's presentation at CinemaCon in April 2022.[155] Feige, Coogler, and the cast promoted the film at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con alongside a live performance from singer Baaba Maal, tama player Massamba Diop, and other African drummers and dancers and the debut of the teaser trailer on July 23, 2022.[156][157] It featured a cover of Bob Marley's \"No Woman, No Cry\" that transitions into Kendrick Lamar's \"Alright\" (2015). Both Leah Simpson and Giovana Gelhoren of People called the footage \"powerful\",[158] while Sandra Gonzalez of CNN felt the teaser commemorated Boseman's performance and wrote \"amid the grief that permeates the preview, there's hope, the birth of new life (literally) and a glimpse at the future, with a clawed sneak peek of a new suited hero\".[159] Writing for IndieWire, Christian Zilko also felt the teaser commemorated Boseman's performance while also opining that this presented a \"daunting\" challenge for Marvel Studios for Black Panther's future, due to Boseman being regarded as \"one of the cornerstones of the MCU moving forward\" and the studio not recasting his role.[160] Variety's Carson Burton and J. Kim Murphy felt the teaser focused on who would \"take on the mantle\" of Black Panther, noting the presence of a mysterious figure at the end of the trailer.[161] The teaser trailer received 172 million views in its first 24 hours of release.[162] Funko Pops for the film were also revealed a day after.[163]\n\nThe film was included in a sizzle reel shown ahead of screenings during National Cinema Day that highlighted upcoming films from various studios.[164] Coogler, Wright, Duke, Bassett, and Huerta promoted the film at the 2022 D23 Expo with exclusive footage, which Aaron Couch from The Hollywood Reporter described as a \"gripping sequence\".[165] An official trailer was released on October 3, 2022.[21] EJ Panaligan at Variety and Narayan Liu of Comic Book Resources both called it an \"exciting\" trailer that provided a better look at the new Black Panther costume,[21][166] with Liu adding it teased \"a more intense storyline centered on loss, strength and the heroes\" of the MCU.[166] Devan Coggan of Entertainment Weekly said the trailer was \"the best look yet at Wakanda's future\" which ended with \"a stunning look at the new Panther suit\".[17] Gizmodo's Linda Codega found everything in the trailer from \"the music, the energy, [and] the intensity\" to be \"incredible\" and exclaimed the film appeared to be \"balanc[ing] political maneuvering, spycraft, and the kind of goofiness [one would] expect out of a Marvel film\".[167]\n\nIn October 2022, Marvel partnered with Target for an ad campaign featuring Thorne reprising her role as Riri Williams. The minute-long ad was directed by Malik Vitthal and shows Williams working on her Mark I Ironheart suit concurrently with a group of young Black girls creating with Lego. Williams sees one of the girls at Target, who gives her inspiration for her suit's power source. Shannon Miller at Adweek called the ad \"a rare occurrence in mainstream marketing\" of two young Black STEM girls interacting. The ad featured several MCU-themed Easter eggs and the song \"I Got the Juice\" by Janelle Monáe featuring Pharrell Williams. It debuted online on October 16, 2022, with an airing during Monday Night Football the following day; 30 and 15-second versions were also created. Marvel and Target's partnership also includes exclusive merchandise and augmented reality experiences within Target stores.[168] Also in October, Sprite Zero Sugar launched a marketing campaign to promote the film from Wieden + Kennedy and Momentum Worldwide.[169] Lexus ran an advertisement promoting its RZ 450e with Gurira portraying Okoye. Lexus and Adidas teamed up to design a custom Lexus LC 500 Convertible for JuJu Smith-Schuster during the world premiere. Both it and the Lexus GX feature in the film.[170]\n\nOn November 1, McDonald's began selling Wakanda Forever Happy Meals which included one of ten toys based on characters from the film.[171] Additionally, Kraft Foods released macaroni and cheese with Wakanda Forever-inspired shapes.[172] A six-episode podcast hosted by Ta-Nehisi Coates, titled Wakanda Forever: The Official Black Panther Podcast, features interviews with the cast and crew discussing the making of the film. The first episode premiered on November 3, 2022, and the subsequent episodes would be released weekly beginning January 2023.[173] Three episodes of the series Marvel Studios: Legends were released on November 4, 2022, exploring T'Challa, Shuri, and the Dora Milaje using footage from their previous MCU appearances,[174] while a 20/20 TV special entitled Black Panther: In Search of Wakanda hosted by Robin Roberts and featuring interviews with the film's cast was aired on ABC.[175] To celebrate the launch of Adidas' \"Wakanda Forever Collection\", Calty Design Research, Adidas School for Experiential Education in Design and Carbon partnered to design a custom Lexus RX 500h F SPORT inspired by the film.[176] Advertisers paid more than $100 million for the promotional campaign of Wakanda Forever according to Deadline Hollywood.[170]\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever premiered at the El Capitan Theatre and the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on October 26, 2022.[177][178] It also premiered in Lagos, Nigeria on November 6, 2022, an occasion Deadline Hollywood described as the first local premiere for a Marvel film.[179]\n\nIt began releasing internationally on November 9, 2022,[177] and in the United States on November 11.[116] It was previously scheduled for May 6 and then for July 8, 2022.[58][62] The film was released theatrically in France, despite the country's 17-month waiting period for when films can appear on streaming services after its theatrical release. Disney's decision to release Wakanda Forever in theaters was encouraged by the French government's acknowledgment that their media chronology needed to be modernized and their timeline to do so, after previously opting to skip the theatrical release of their film Strange World (2022) and release it directly to Disney+. Under the current chronology, Wakanda Forever would first become available on Disney+ in France in early 2024.[180] The removal of a depiction of a same-sex relationship between Ayo and Aneka, along with some other edits, were made for the film to be released in Kuwait.[181] Wakanda Forever was released in China on February 7, 2023, becoming the first MCU film to be released in the country since Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019).[182] It is the final film of Phase Four of the MCU.[183]\n\nThe film was released on Disney+ on February 1, 2023, with an IMAX Enhanced version also available.[184] It was also released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on February 7, 2023. The home media includes audio commentary, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and various behind-the-scenes featurettes.[185] Upon its release on Disney+, the film became the most-watched Marvel film premiere globally on the service, based on hours streamed in its first five days.[186]\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever has grossed $453.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $405.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $859.2 million.[5][4] It is the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2022.[187] Its worldwide opening weekend earned $331.6 million, marking the third-largest opening of the pandemic era, behind Spider-Man: No Way Home ($601 million) and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness ($452 million).[188] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $259 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it fifth on their list of 2022's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[2]\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Wakanda Forever was projected to earn $175 million in the US and Canada on its opening weekend.[189] By November 2022, Boxoffice Pro estimated the film's opening weekend in the US and Canada to be between $170–205 million, and projected the film would earn $435–543 million for its total domestic gross.[190] The film made $84.3 million on its first day, which included $28 million from Thursday night previews.[191][192] Its opening weekend earned $181.3 million, becoming the top film of the weekend.[193] This marked the largest November opening weekend ever, surpassing The Hunger Games: Catching Fire ($158.1 million), and the third-biggest opening for a film during the pandemic era, behind No Way Home ($260 million) and Multiverse of Madness ($187 million).[194] Wakanda Forever remained the top film in its sophomore weekend, grossing over $66.5 million, representing a drop of 63%.[195] The following weekend, the film remained atop the box office, grossing $45.6 million (a decline of 31%). Its gross over the five-day Thanksgiving weekend was $63.8 million.[196][197] The film remained atop the chart for its fourth and fifth weekend, earning $17.5 million and $11.2 million, respectively.[198][199] In its sixth weekend, Wakanda Forever earned $5.3 million and was displaced by Avatar: The Way of Water.[200] It is the third-highest-grossing film of 2022 in the region behind Top Gun: Maverick and The Way of Water.[201]\n\nOutside of the US and Canada, the film grossed $150.3 million from 50 markets in its first weekend. It had the biggest opening ever for a film in Nigeria, as well as the second-biggest for a film released in 2022 in France and South Africa.[188] Disney Africa reported that the film set an all-time box office record in West Africa and accumulated the biggest opening of 2022 in East Africa, as well as the second-highest box office gross ever in Southern Africa.[202][203] The five highest openings for the film were in the United Kingdom and Ireland ($15 million), France ($13.7 million), Mexico ($12.8 million), South Korea ($8.9 million) and Brazil ($7.1 million).[188] In its second weekend, Wakanda Forever grossed $69.8 million, for a drop of 49%,[204] while in its third weekend, it grossed $32.1 million, for a drop of 53%.[205] As of March 12, 2023[update], the highest grossing territories were the United Kingdom ($41 million), Mexico ($35.9 million), France ($33.2 million), Brazil ($21.4 million), and Australia ($19.5 million).[4]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 84% with an average rating of 7.1/10, based on 450 reviews. The site's critics consensus reads: \"A poignant tribute that satisfyingly moves the franchise forward, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever marks an ambitious and emotionally rewarding triumph for the MCU\".[207] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[208] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported audience members gave the film an overall positive score of 93%, with 85% saying that they would definitely recommend it.[209]\n\nKambole Campbell at Empire gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, stating that the film \"stands out from a somewhat formulaic era of Marvel movies: held together by its compelling sense of place, and by acting as a passionate eulogy for Chadwick Boseman\", and feeling that it was \"imaginative and... grounded, which makes the tilt to the usual CG-dominated spectacle a little jarring\". Campbell lauded the performances of Wright, Duke, Bassett, and Coel, and described Huerta's character as \"a highlight, an imaginative adaptation of the veteran comics character, one who here speaks truth with convincing venom\".[210] Tom Jorgensen at IGN gave the film 7 out of 10, stating that it was \"an effective, emotional farewell to T'Challa—a meditation on forging one's own future out of a painful past—but with a plot that has to introduce an entirely new nation and pave the way for a new wave of Marvel stories, it does struggle under the weight of all that expectation\". Jorgensen lauded Bassett and Huerta's performances, but he felt that Talokan had not been \"establish[ed]... quite as gracefully\" and the film's third act had \"push[ed] its luck too far... with a poorly conceived and logically baffling tactical choice\".[211]\n\nOwen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: \"The movie doesn't have the classic comic-book pow of Black Panther, and it's easily 20 minutes too long (we could probably have lived without the Talokan backstory). Yet Wakanda Forever has a slow-burn emotional suspense. Once the film starts to gather steam, it doesn't let up\".[212] Similarly, Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune felt Wakanda Forever \"is not special like the first movie was. The quality of the storytelling and especially the action sequences grows less effective as the film proceeds\". Nevertheless, he singled out that \"every actor on screen here is marvelous, even when the script and effects-driven spectacle settles for the wrong kind of 'more'\".[213] Peter Travers of ABC News commended the performances from Bassett, Wright and Thorne, but wrote the film's runtime \"feels loooong, with dragged out battle scenes, excessive computer effects and way too much franchise building\".[214] The BBC's Nicholas Barber said that the sequel struggled due to the loss of Boseman, but commended the visual effects and Bassett, Wright, and Lupita Nyong'o's acting.[215]\n\nDavid Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter felt that \"[e]ven if the length feels overextended, Coogler and his editors deserve credit for allowing breathing space between the action scenes for character and relationship development, with Ludwig Göransson's African-inflected score enhancing both those quieter moments and the big smackdowns. It's impossible for Wakanda Forever to match the breakthrough impact of its predecessor, but in terms of continuing the saga while paving the way for future installments, it's amply satisfying\".[216] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote: \"Wakanda Forever winds up feeling hopelessly stalled, covering up an inability to move on by resorting to repetitive, over-familiar action sequences, maudlin emotional beats and an uninvolving, occasionally incoherent story\".[217] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film two stars out of four, criticizing the film's runtime and worldbuilding subplots. He further wrote that the sequel is \"not so much a bad movie as it is disappointing and frustrating. There are some strong moments both in terms of character development (primarily for Shuri, who has the deepest and most compelling arc) and action (the car chase is perfunctory but some of the battle scenes are well-executed), but not enough of them. There are no rousing moments designed to elicit a mass cheer from the audience\".[218]\n\nFrench Minister of Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu took issue with the portrayal of the French Armed Forces in the film, calling it a \"false and misleading representation\". A scene in the film shows French mercenaries who were captured by Wakandans after they attacked an outpost in Mali being brought before the United Nations in uniforms similar to those worn by French soldiers in Operation Barkhane. This was considered a \"sensitive\" storyline for France, given its soldiers withdrew from its involvement in the Mali War in 2022, and were replaced by Russia's Wagner Group.[219]\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever was nominated for five Academy Awards (winning one),[220] a British Academy Film Award,[221] six Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two),[222] two Golden Globe Awards (winning one),[223] and two Screen Actors Guild Awards,[224] among others. Bassett became the first actress to win a major acting award for her role in a Marvel film.[206] In addition, with Bassett's nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the 95th Academy Awards, Wakanda Forever became the first Marvel film to be nominated for an Academy Award in an acting category.[225]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced.[226] The special on this film, \"The Making of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\", was released on Disney+ on February 8, 2023.[227]\n\nIn November 2022, Moore stated that the Disney+ miniseries Ironheart would serve as a direct sequel to Wakanda Forever, with Thorne returning to reprise her role as Riri Williams.[228] Ironheart is scheduled to be released on June 24, 2025.[229] It will be part of Phase Five of the MCU.[14]\n\nIn November 2022, Coogler and Feige were revealed to have discussed a potential third Black Panther film.[230] In January 2023, Wright believed a third film was being considered, noting that the cast and Coogler needed \"a little bit of a break... to regroup\" before starting work on a third film.[231] By November 2024, Coogler had had discussions with Denzel Washington about casting him for a role in a third film.[232] The next month, Moore announced plans to exit his role at Marvel Studios in March 2025 to pursue producing outside the studio, though he would return to produce Black Panther 3 along with Marvel Studios.[233]\n"

        "content": "\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a 2023 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the characters Scott Lang / Ant-Man and Hope Pym / Wasp. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to Ant-Man (2015) and Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), and the 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It was directed by Peyton Reed, written by Jeff Loveness, and stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang and Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne, alongside Jonathan Majors, Kathryn Newton, David Dastmalchian, Katy O'Brian, William Jackson Harper, Bill Murray, Michelle Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll, and Michael Douglas. In the film, Lang, Van Dyne, and their family are accidentally transported to the Quantum Realm and face off against Kang the Conqueror (Majors).\n\nPlans for a third Ant-Man film were confirmed in November 2019, with Reed and Rudd returning. Loveness was hired by April 2020, with development beginning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The title and new cast members, including the additions of Majors and Newton, were announced in December 2020. Filming in Turkey began in early February 2021, and additional filming occurred in San Francisco in mid-June. Principal photography began at the end of July at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire and ended in November.\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania premiered in Westwood, Los Angeles, on February 6, 2023, and was released in the United States on February 17. It is the first film, and beginning, of Phase Five of the MCU. The film received mixed reviews from critics. It was a box-office disappointment, grossing $476.1 million worldwide against a gross production budget of $388.4 million and becoming one of the few MCU films not to break-even in its theatrical run.\n\nFollowing the Avengers's battle against Thanos,[a] Scott Lang has become a successful memoirist and has been living happily with his girlfriend, Hope van Dyne. Scott's now-teenage daughter Cassie has become an activist, helping people displaced by the Blip, resulting in her having a strained relationship with her father. While visiting Hope's parents, Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne, Cassie reveals that she has been working on a device that can establish contact with the Quantum Realm. Upon learning of this, Janet panics and forcefully shuts off the device, but the message is received, resulting in a portal that opens and sucks the five of them into the Quantum Realm. Scott and Cassie are found by natives who are rebelling against their ruler, while Hope, Janet, and Hank explore a sprawling city to get answers.\n\nHope, Janet, and Hank meet with Lord Krylar, a former ally of Janet's, who reveals that things have changed since she left,[b] and that he is now working for Kang, the Quantum Realm's new ruler. The three are forced to flee and steal Krylar's ship. The Langs, meanwhile, are told by rebel leader Jentorra that Janet's involvement with Kang is indirectly responsible for his rise to power. The rebels soon come under attack by Kang's forces led by M.O.D.O.K., who is revealed to be Darren Cross, having survived his apparent death at the hands of Scott,[c] and who previously received Cassie's message. Aboard Krylar's ship, Janet confesses to Hope and Hank that she met Kang when she was previously in the Quantum Realm. He claimed that he and Janet could both escape from the Quantum Realm if she helped him rebuild his multiversal power core. After they managed to repair it, Janet saw a vision of Kang conquering and destroying entire timelines. Kang revealed he was exiled by his variants out of fear, which drove Janet to turn against him. Outmatched, Janet used her Pym Particles to enlarge the power core beyond use. Kang, having regained his powers, eventually conquered the Quantum Realm afterward.\n\nThe Langs are taken to Kang, who demands that Scott help get his power core back or else he will kill Cassie. Scott is then taken to the core's location and shrinks down. In the core, he encounters a probability storm, which causes him to split into multiple copies of himself nearly overwhelming him, but Hope arrives and helps him acquire the power core. However, Kang reneges on the deal, capturing Janet with M.O.D.O.K. destroying her ship with Hank on it. After being rescued by his ants, who rapidly evolved and became hyper-intelligent after being pulled into the Quantum Realm, Hank helps Scott and Hope as they make their way to Kang. Cassie rescues Jentorra and they commence an uprising against Kang and his army. During the fight, Cassie convinces Cross to switch sides and fight Kang, with him eventually sacrificing his life.\n\nJanet fixes the power core as she, Hank, Hope, and Cassie jump through a portal home. Kang attacks Scott at the last minute. Before he can beat Scott into submission, Hope returns, and she and Scott throw Kang and the Pym Particles into the power core, destroying them both. Cassie reopens the portal for Scott and Hope to return home. As Scott happily resumes his life, he begins to rethink what he was told about Kang's death being the start of something terrible happening, but brushes it off. In a mid-credits scene, numerous variants of Kang, led by Immortus, commiserate Kang's death and plan their multiversal uprising. In a post-credits scene, Loki and Mobius M. Mobius encounter another Kang variant, Victor Timely, at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893.[d]\n\nAdditionally, Randall Park briefly reprises his role as FBI agent Jimmy Woo from previous MCU media,[41] along with Gregg Turkington as Baskin-Robbins store manager Dale from Ant-Man.[42] Ruben Rabasa appears as a coffee shop attendant who mistakes Ant-Man for Spider-Man.[34] A man asking Lang for a picture with his dog is played by Mark Oliver Everett, frontman of the rock band Eels, whose father was quantum physicist Hugh Everett III and the originator of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory.[43] Roger Craig Smith and Matthew Wood voice the Quantumnauts, the foot soldiers of Kang.[44] The film's post-credits scene features uncredited cameo appearances by Tom Hiddleston and Owen Wilson, reprising their respective roles as Loki and Mobius M. Mobius from Loki.[24]\n\nAhead of the release of Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), director Peyton Reed said there were elements of that film that leave \"a lot to play with\" in a potential third film in the franchise. He highlighted the Quantum Realm, which was introduced in Ant-Man (2015) and explored further in Ant-Man and the Wasp; Reed said they were \"just dipping our toes into it\" for the previous films.[45] Reed added that he and Marvel Studios were hopeful about a third film and had discussed potential story points for such a sequel.[46] In February 2019, Hank Pym actor Michael Douglas confirmed that informal discussions regarding a sequel to Ant-Man and the Wasp had taken place,[47] though by that time Evangeline Lilly had not heard of any plans for her character Hope van Dyne / Wasp following her role in Avengers: Endgame (2019). Lilly stated that \"Hope is mid-journey. I don't see her journey as being over by any stretch.\"[48] That October, Michelle Pfeiffer expressed interest in reprising her role of Janet van Dyne in a sequel,[49] while Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige was asked about the future of Paul Rudd's Scott Lang / Ant-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) following Endgame, and responded that \"the chess pieces were arranged very purposefully\" at the end of that film, with some taken \"off the board\" and others, like Ant-Man, \"still on [the board, so] you never know\".[50] Rudd was asked whether he would be returning to the role, either in a third Ant-Man film or as part of another hero's MCU franchise, and said that both of those options had been discussed.[51]\n\nReed officially signed on to direct a third Ant-Man film at the start of November 2019. Rudd was set to star as Lang,[8] with Lilly and Douglas also returning.[11] Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2021 with a likely release date in 2022.[52][8] Reed was hired again, despite Marvel's interest in new filmmakers bringing different takes to their heroes for each film, because executives felt he had \"a real grasp on the Ant-Man universe and want[ed] to see him return to wrap up his trilogy\".[11] Jeff Loveness was hired to write the script for the film during \"the early days of Hollywood's shutdown\" due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and he had begun working on the screenplay by April 2020. At that point, it was no longer clear when production would begin on the film due to the effects of the pandemic on all film productions.[53] In August 2020, Reed confirmed that development on the film was continuing during the pandemic. He said that Lilly would continue to get equal billing in the film alongside Rudd as she is \"a very, very important part\" of the partnership between Ant-Man and the Wasp, despite rumors that her role would be reduced following controversial comments about the pandemic. Reed added that the story for the film had been \"cracked\", though \"nothing [was] official yet\",[54] and said the third film would be a \"bigger, more sprawling movie than the first two [with] a very different visual template\".[55] Reed stated they wanted to further explore the Quantum Realm in the film as a \"massive world-building undertaking\", and compared its design to electron microscope photography, the Heavy Metal magazine issues of the 1970s and 1980s and his favorite science fiction cover artists such as Jean Giraud for fantastical realism.[14] Marvel Studios producer Brian Gay said the film would \"feel like a real departure\" from the first two Ant-Man films and be a big adventure.[56] Fellow Marvel Studios executive Stephen Broussard produced the film alongside Feige.[57]\n\nJonathan Majors was cast in September 2020 in a \"lead role\" for the film, which was reported to be Kang the Conqueror.[59] Because the actor cast as Kang would first portray an alternate version of the character, named He Who Remains, in the Disney+ series Loki, Kate Herron and Michael Waldron—the director and head writer of Loki's first season, respectively—were involved in casting Majors in addition to Reed and executives at Marvel Studios;[60][13] Marvel Studios were eager to work with and cast Majors after seeing his performance in The Last Black Man in San Francisco (2019), with Reed very supportive of approaching Majors.[61] Majors was approached for the role without an audition,[62] and later noted he had been involved in the film \"since the beginning\" before joining Loki.[17] Reed was interested in having Ant-Man and the Wasp go up against a formidable foe in the film, believing Kang to be one of Marvel Comics' \"all-timers\" like Loki and Doctor Doom.[19]\n\nIn November 2020, filming was expected to start in 2021.[63] The following month, Pfeiffer confirmed her involvement and that filming would begin in mid-2021,[36] while she and Douglas both indicated that the film would be released in 2022.[64][65] Later in December at Disney's Investor Day, Feige revealed the film's title as Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, confirmed the return of Rudd, Lilly, Douglas and Pfeiffer, alongside Majors as Kang, and revealed that Kathryn Newton had joined the film as Cassie Lang.[27] Newton originally auditioned for the role of Kate Bishop in the Disney+ miniseries Hawkeye (2021), before Hailee Steinfeld was cast as the character.[66] Emma Fuhrmann, who played the character as a teenager in Avengers: Endgame, was saddened by the announcement of Newton taking over the role, and hoped to be involved in the MCU in the future.[67] Later that month, Loveness revealed that he had turned in the first draft of the script, and said Marvel had used the COVID-19 pandemic break to \"do something new and weird\" with the film.[68] Loveness was inspired by several \"father and daughter\" films starring Steve Martin or Robin Williams from the 1990s, like Father of the Bride, Hook (both 1991) and Jumanji (1995), with Loveness feeling that because he admired all those father characters, he could mix the \"underdog dad\" hero energy with Rudd's likability to make it a through line for the film.[69] Broussard described the film as a \"family adventure\" film that becomes \"an epic sci-fi war movie and a coming-of-age story\".[70]: 2–3 \n\nOn February 4, 2021, Turkey's Minister of Culture and Tourism Mehmet Ersoy announced that shooting for the film had begun in the country's region of Cappadocia, with the production also set to film in other parts of Turkey.[71] At the beginning of March, Tip \"T.I.\" Harris was revealed to not be returning as his character Dave from the first two Ant-Man films.[72][73] This news came after sexual abuse allegations against Harris and his wife Tameka Cottle arose at the end of February, but Variety reported that this was unrelated and Harris was never set to return for the sequel.[72] In early May 2021, Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released on February 17, 2023.[74] In mid-June, Rudd and Douglas headed to England to prepare for filming.[75][76] Shooting to capture exterior shots and background plates took place at the San Francisco Police Department Central Station in North Beach, San Francisco on June 19 and 20, with filming of the station's interior, the outward view of the building, and downtown San Francisco.[77] In July, Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair reported that Corey Stoll, who portrayed Darren Cross / Yellowjacket in Ant-Man, would appear in \"some shape\" for Quantumania.[78] Reed planned to feature comedian Tom Scharpling again in the film, after his cameos in the previous two films were ultimately cut from the theatrical releases; however, the scene in which he would have been featured was cut before it was filmed.[79]\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 26, 2021,[80] at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire,[81] using the working title Dust Bunny,[82] with Bill Pope serving as cinematographer.[83] Industrial Light & Magic provided the same StageCraft virtual production technology Reed used while directing episodes of the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian.[81] Will Htay served as the production designer.[84] Principal photography was previously set to begin in January 2021 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[52][53][85] It was then expected to take place between May 31 and September 24.[86] By September 16, over 50 crew members from Pinewood Studios productions, mainly Quantumania and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023), contracted norovirus following an outbreak at the studio. The main cast was not affected.[87] In October, the film's release was delayed to July 28, 2023.[88] Later that month, Bill Murray revealed he had shot material for a Marvel film with Reed, which was believed to be Quantumania. Murray explained he joined the project as he liked Reed and his work on Bring It On (2000), despite not being interested in superhero films,[89] before he further indicated his involvement in the film, but said he could not comment on his prior statement;[90][91] Murray later said he was playing a \"bad guy\" in the film.[35] During the filming process, the screenplay was reportedly still being worked on at the same time, with multiple scenes involving Murray and Katy O'Brian's Jentorra later being scrapped, resulting in Murray's character seemingly dying.[31] Principal photography was completed in November 2021.[92] Filming was also expected to take place in Atlanta,[86] and the production was slated to move to San Francisco in 2022 with the cast.[77]\n\nIn April 2022, the film was moved back to its February 17, 2023, release date, swapping places with The Marvels because Quantumania was further along in production than that film.[93] In September 2022, Randall Park was confirmed to be reprising his role as Jimmy Woo,[41] and Feige called the film \"a direct line\" into Phase Five and the planned Phase Six film Avengers: The Kang Dynasty,[94] with Majors attached to reprise his role in The Kang Dynasty.[19] Reed stated that Quantumania would have a \"profound impact\" on the MCU and that the impact of Kang's appearance in this film was discussed with Loveness for The Kang Dynasty, which he was also writing.[23] Loveness felt that having Kang as the main villain of Quantumania would set up the dynamic story he was developing for The Kang Dynasty.[16] Marvel Studios was not initially planning to have \"The Multiverse Saga\", which comprises Phases Four, Five, and Six, revolve around Kang, but decided to after seeing Majors' performance in the first season of Loki and the dailies while filming Quantumania.[58] Reed also hoped the film would not be viewed as a \"palate cleanser\" the previous two films had been following Avengers films, but would instead feel as big as an Avengers film.[19] Gregg Turkington was also revealed to be reprising his role as Dale, a Baskin-Robbins manager, from Ant-Man.[42] In October 2022, William Jackson Harper was revealed to be appearing in the film in an undisclosed role,[95] and in November, O'Brian was revealed to be appearing in the film alongside David Dastmalchian, who portrayed Kurt in the first two films,[96] after he previously said he was not involved in Quantumania.[97] In January 2023, Dastmalchian, Harper, O'Brian, Murray, and Stoll were revealed to be playing Veb, Quaz, Jentorra, Lord Krylar,[28] and M.O.D.O.K., respectively.[37] Pick-up shots with Rudd occurred by then.[98]\n\nThe film's mid-credits scene sees the introduction of the Council of Kangs, particularly Immortus, Rama-Tut, and Centurion. These variants, all portrayed by Majors, discuss how the Conqueror has been killed and that the Avengers are starting to infringe on the multiverse and what they have built. This leads to hundreds of other Kang variants filling an arena,[25] in a shot reminiscent of the council's first appearance in comics in The Avengers #292 (June 1988).[99] The post-credits scene is footage from the Loki season 2 episode \"1893\" (2023),[99][5][6][7] with Majors appearing as Victor Timely, a Kang variant, and Tom Hiddleston and Owen Wilson reprising their respective Loki roles of Loki and Mobius M. Mobius.[24][25][5][6][7]\n\nThe film's main-on-end title sequence was designed by Perception, which emulated the visuals of the Quantum Realm using fluid motion and microscopic chemical reactions.[100] The visual effects were made by Sony Pictures Imageworks, Industrial Light & Magic, Digital Domain, Moving Picture Company, Fin Design + Effects, Spin VFX, Rising Sun Pictures, Folks VFX, Barnstorm VFX, Base FX, Pixomondo, MARZ, Luma Pictures, Atomic Arts, Territory Studio, and Stereo D,[101] with Jesse James Chisholm as the visual effects supervisor,[83] while Adam Gerstel and Laura Jennings co-edited the film.[102] Due to the shifting release schedule of the film, the post-production period for Quantumania was reduced by four-and-a-half months, which resulted in reportedly at least 10 rushed visual effects scenes being added at the last minute.[103] Several visual effects companies that worked on Quantumania were also in post-production on Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) around the same time, which resulted in \"critical resources\" being diverted to focus on Wakanda Forever.[104] Disney spent $194.7 million during pre-production and filming and an additional $131.9 million on post-production in 2022 for a total gross production budget of $326.6 million, which was over 63% more than an initially estimated $200 million production budget and exceeded that of Disney's internal projections for the budget. Disney also received a total reimbursement from the UK government of $50.6 million, which reduced the net budget to $276 million.[105]\n\nIn March 2023, Marvel Studios filed a request to issue a subpoena to Reddit to identify the person or group who was responsible for leaking the script and subtitle file for the film in January 2023 to the subreddit r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers, as well as a subpoena to Google since the leaked information had been uploaded to Google Docs.[106] As a result of the request, r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers temporarily went private and became unavailable to the public.[107] The subreddit was reopened in July 2023.[108]\n\nChristophe Beck was revealed to be composing the score by July 2022, after previously working on the previous two Ant-Man films, as well as the MCU Disney+ series WandaVision and Hawkeye (both in 2021).[109] The soundtrack album was released digitally by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on February 15, 2023,[110] with its first track, \"Theme from Quantumania\", released as a digital single on February 12.[111]\n\nThe first footage from the film was shown at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con where Feige, Reed, and the cast promoted the film and discussed the characters.[9] Further footage was shown at D23 in September, which Ryan Leston at IGN called \"an intriguing glimpse\" into the film.[94] A teaser trailer for the film was released on October 24, 2022. It featured \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" by Elton John.[57] Tom Chapman at Den of Geek noted the trailer was \"darker than ever\" compared to the comedic tone of the prior two Ant-Man films and featured \"dramatic pauses and tense musical cues\", but felt it was \"another MCU teaser trailer that does a little too much teasing\" to not reveal key details, such as the absence of the character M.O.D.O.K. who was shown in the D23 footage.[112] Charles Pulliuam-Moore of The Verge compared the trailer to Disney's then-upcoming film Strange World (2022) and highlighted the Quantum Realm's appearance as being \"beautiful and nonsensical\",[113] while Empire's Owen Williams compared the Quantum Realm to Ego's planet from the MCU film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017).[114]\n\nA new trailer for the film debuted during the 2023 College Football Playoff National Championship on January 9 before it was released online. Daniel Chin of The Ringer noted the trailer had revealed \"a lot\" as compared to the teaser one, including the lay out of the film's plot and the first look at M.O.D.O.K. Chin felt the trailer had featured \"some misdirections... but it seems to supply more advance knowledge than Marvel typically dispenses.\"[115] That month, Heineken released a commercial featuring Rudd to promote their non-alcoholic beer and the film.[116] The following month, Volkswagen released a commercial that was directed by Anthony Leonardi III to promote the film and their SUV model ID.4.[117] Additionally, Lang's fictional memoir, Look Out for the Little Guy, was announced to be published by Hyperion Avenue, created alongside Marvel Studios and the filmmakers, and was released on September 5, 2023. It features \"over 20 short pieces exploring different aspects of Scott's experiences\" as a father and Avenger,[118] and was written by Rob Kutner. Loveness wrote the passages that were featured in the film.[119]\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania had its world premiere at Regency Village Theatre in Westwood, Los Angeles, on February 6, 2023,[120] and was released in the United States and China on February 17, 2023.[93][121] The film was previously set to be released in 2022,[64][65] before being officially announced as releasing on February 17, 2023, in May 2021.[74] It was delayed to July 28, 2023, in October 2021,[88] and returned to the February 2023 date in April 2022.[93] It is the first film, and start of, Phase Five of the MCU.[122]\n\nThe film was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on digital download on April 18, 2023; on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on May 16; and on Disney+ on May 17.[123]\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania grossed $214.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $261.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $476.1 million.[3][4] It was a box-office disappointment, falling short of its reported break-even point of $600 million,[124] against a gross production budget of $388.4 million.[2] This budget was initially reported to be around $200 million.[125][124]\n\nIn January 2023, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was projected to earn $120 million in North America over the four-day Presidents' Day opening weekend.[126] The following month, it was projected to debut at $105–110 million domestically and $280 million globally in its opening weekend.[127] The film made $46 million on its first day, including $17.5 million from Thursday previews that began at 3 pm. It went on to debut to $106.1 million (and a total of $120.4 million over the four-day frame) from 4,345 theatres, marking the best opening of the Ant-Man series and the third-best for a February release, behind Black Panther ($242.1 million in 2018) and Deadpool ($152.1 million in 2016).[125][3][128] The film's second weekend saw a 69% drop, down to $32 million in North America, the largest second-week domestic drop-off of any Marvel Cinematic Universe film.[129] In its third weekend, the film earned $12.4 million, for a drop of 61%.[130]\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film grossed $121.3 million in its opening weekend.[131] In its second weekend, the film earned $46.4 million, for a drop of 57%, and remained the number one non-local movie in most markets.[132] The film grossed $22 million from 52 markets in its third weekend, for a decline of 53%.[133] The top five international markets were China ($39.4 million), the UK ($23.9 million), Mexico ($18 million), France ($13.6 million), and South Korea ($12.6 million).[134]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 46% with an average rating of 5.5/10, based on 410 reviews. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania mostly lacks the spark of fun that elevated earlier adventures, but Jonathan Majors' Kang is a thrilling villain poised to alter the course of the MCU.\"[135] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 61 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[136] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, and those polled by PostTrak reported 75% of audience members gave the film a positive score, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it.[128]\n\nOwen Gleiberman from Variety was critical of the film, calling it \"at once fun and numbing\" and stating \"...if this is what Phase 5 looks like, God save us from Phases 6, 7 and 8.\"[137] Caryn James from the BBC stated that the movie has \"Marvel's next big villain but other than that, it has nothing to offer beyond drab-looking action.\"[138] Wendy Ide from The Guardian called Majors's performance the film's \"magnetic core\", but said that overall the film was \"baffling and illogical\".[139] Ross Bonaime from Collider also praised Majors's performance, writing he \"makes for an excellent villain, who brings nuance and subtlety to his character ... Majors makes this character [Kang] likable in the beginning, but also never hides the menace and terror that he can cause at any moment.\" Giving the film a B−, Bonaime stated: \"Quantumania is a promising, but shaky start for Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's just a shame it comes at the sake of the little guy.\"[140] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter commended Majors for \"bringing real gravitas\" to the film, and investing \"his performance with such an arrestingly quiet stillness and ambivalence that you're on edge every moment he's onscreen.\" Scheck also praised Pfeiffer, writing she \"is terrific in her expanded role, given the opportunity to be a badass heroine and making the most of it.\"[141] Manohla Dargis from The New York Times felt Pfeiffer, Majors, and Douglas were the \"truer stars of this show\", but felt the overall film was \"busy, noisy and thoroughly uninspired\".[142]\n\nRichard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times rated the film three out of four stars, writing it is a \"mid-tier MCU film, with decent enough battle sequences and some nifty visuals\".[143] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly graded the film a B+, concluding: \"At just over 120 minutes, though — a blink in Marvel time — this Ant-Man is clever enough to be fun, and wise enough not overstay its welcome. Who better understands the benefits, after all, of keeping it small?\"[144] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four, stating it is \"less fun, and blandly garish visually. The earlier films' throwaway jokes and welcome aversion to brutal solemnity have largely been ditched in favor of endless endgame stuff and weirdly cheesy digital world-building in the Quantum Realm.\"[145] Similarly, David Sims of The Atlantic disapprovingly compared the film to the first two entries, writing in his review: \"That cleverness, combined with the special-effect goofiness of people and objects getting big and small, powered the series—and it is basically been junked here, replaced by a bunch of celestial showdowns between Kang and Ant-Man. Anytime Quantumania allows itself to get a little silly, it's in much better shape.\"[146]\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania received a nomination for Best Music Supervision in a Trailer – Film at the 2023 Guild of Music Supervisors Awards.[147] At the 2023 MTV Movie & TV Awards, it was nominated for Best Hero (Rudd) and Best Kick-Ass Cast.[148] The film garnered a nomination for Best Fantasy Adventure TV Spot (for a Feature Film) at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards.[149][150] The film is also nominated for Best Superhero Film at the 51st Saturn Awards,[151] and for Best Visual Effects or Animation at the 13th AACTA Awards.[152] At the 49th People's Choice Awards, it is nominated for Action Movie of the Year.[153] At the 44th Golden Raspberry Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Supporting Actor for both Douglas and Murray, Worst Remake, Rip-off or Sequel, and Worst Director for Reed.[154]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced.[155] The special on this film, \"The Making of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\", was released on Disney+ on July 19, 2023.[156]\n\nIn February 2023, Broussard said he had started to discuss a potential fourth film with Feige and Reed.[157] Douglas said he would be interested in returning for a fourth film if Pym died in it,[158] but in April 2024 he said \"I don't think I'm going to show up\" for a fourth film because he had requested for Pym to die in Quantumania and was disappointed that this did not happen.[159]\n"

        "content": "\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (marketed as Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3) is a 2023 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team Guardians of the Galaxy, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), and the 32nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by James Gunn, it features an ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldaña, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Will Poulter, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Linda Cardellini, Nathan Fillion, and Sylvester Stallone. In the film, the other Guardians race to save the life of Rocket (Cooper) from his creator, the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), who is an alien scientist trying to perfect the universe.\n\nGunn had initial ideas for a third and final Guardians of the Galaxy film by November 2014, and announced his return to write and direct in April 2017 ahead of Vol. 2's release. Vol. 3 explores the origin story of Rocket, with whom Gunn personally identifies. Disney fired Gunn from Vol. 3 in July 2018 after controversial jokes he made on Twitter resurfaced. Gunn received support from several cast members, and the studio reversed course by that October. His return was publicly revealed in March 2019, and he restarted work on the film after completing his film The Suicide Squad (2021) and the first season of its spin-off series Peacemaker (2022) for DC Films. New cast members, including Iwuji and Poulter, joined by the start of filming, which took place at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, from November 2021 to May 2022.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 premiered at Disneyland Paris on April 22, 2023, and was released in the United States on May 5, as part of Phase Five of the MCU. Like its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success, with many deeming it to be a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy. It grossed over $845.6 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2023. At the 96th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Visual Effects.\n\nAt their new headquarters on Knowhere, the Guardians of the Galaxy are attacked by Adam Warlock, a Sovereign warrior created by High Priestess Ayesha who seeks to destroy them for stealing from her.[a] After critically wounding Rocket, Adam is stabbed by Nebula and flees. The Guardians' med-packs are ineffective at healing Rocket's wounds due to a kill switch embedded in him by the organization Orgocorp. The Guardians travel to Orgocorp's headquarters to find the switch's override code and save Rocket's life.\n\nAs Rocket lies unconscious, he recalls his past. He was found as a baby raccoon and was experimented on by the High Evolutionary, Orgocorp's leader, who sought to enhance and anthropomorphize animal lifeforms, known as Humanimals, to create an ideal society called Counter-Earth. Rocket's fellow Batch 89 test subjects were the otter Lylla, the walrus Teefs, and the rabbit Floor. The High Evolutionary was impressed by Rocket's growing intelligence and used his insight to fix a defect in later Humanimal batches. However, he became envious of Rocket's intellect and planned to harvest his brain for further research before incinerating the obsolete Batch 89. Rocket attempted to free his friends, but the High Evolutionary killed Lylla and mocked Rocket for showing grief over her death. Enraged, Rocket mauled the High Evolutionary, whose henchmen killed Teefs and Floor in the ensuing firefight. Rocket fled in a spaceship.\n\nIn the present, an alternate version of Gamora,[b] who has joined the Ravagers, helps the Guardians infiltrate Orgocorp. They retrieve Rocket's file but discover that the code was removed by Theel, one of the High Evolutionary's advisors. The Guardians and Gamora travel to Counter-Earth to find him. They are followed by Ayesha and Adam after the High Evolutionary, their race's creator, threatens to wipe out the Sovereign if they fail to retrieve Rocket. At Counter-Earth, Drax and Mantis remain with Gamora and Rocket, while Peter Quill, Groot, and Nebula are guided to the Arête Laboratories complex. Nebula is forced to wait outside by guards due to her cybernetic enhancements; Quill and Groot enter Arête. Drax tricks Mantis into pursuing Quill's group and Gamora saves Rocket from Adam and War Pig, one of the High Evolutionary's guards.\n\nQuestioned by Quill, the High Evolutionary admits this version of Counter-Earth's society is imperfect, so he bombards the planet, killing the Humanimals and Ayesha. Arête departs as a spaceship, with Nebula, Drax, and Mantis boarding to rescue Quill and Groot. However, the latter pair escapes Arête with Theel, whom they kill before retrieving the code from his corpse. They are rescued by Gamora on their ship. As Quill's group uses the code, Rocket flatlines and has a near-death experience in which he reunites with Lylla, Teefs, and Floor. However, Lylla tells him his time has not yet come, as Quill succeeds in disabling the kill switch and restarting Rocket's heart.\n\nDrax, Nebula, and Mantis encounter the High Evolutionary's next batch of test subjects, genetically modified humanoid children, before being captured. The other Guardians stage a rescue, leading to a battle against the High Evolutionary's forces. Kraglin fires on Arête with Knowhere and then helps to save Knowhere's citizens from a counter-attack by the High Evolutionary's Hellspawn. Intent on retreat, the High Evolutionary's crew mutiny, but their leader kills them. Drax, Nebula, and Mantis befriend three monstrous Abilisks to escape and reunite with the rest of the Guardians. The Guardians delay leaving Arête, choosing to rescue the children, who escape to Knowhere via a tunnel constructed by Cosmo's telekinesis. Rocket discovers imprisoned animals on the ship and is confronted by the High Evolutionary, whom the other Guardians defeat. Rocket spares the High Evolutionary,[c] and the Guardians help the animals escape to Knowhere. Quill nearly dies trying to reach Knowhere but is saved by Adam, whom Groot had rescued earlier from Arête's destruction.\n\nQuill decides to leave the Guardians, names Rocket as the new captain, and reunites with his grandfather on Earth. Mantis embarks on a journey of self-discovery with the Abilisks, Gamora rejoins the Ravagers, and Nebula and Drax remain on Knowhere to raise the rescued children. The new Guardians—Rocket, Groot, Kraglin, Cosmo, Adam, Phyla (one of the rescued children), and Adam's pet Blurp—later take on a mission.\n\nReprising their respective roles from previous Guardians films and/or The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022) are Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha, the golden High Priestess and the leader of the Sovereign people who created Adam Warlock to destroy the Guardians;[38] Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex, a high-ranking Ravager;[39] Seth Green as the voice of Howard the Duck;[40] Christopher Fairbank as the Broker;[40] Stephen Blackehart and Rhett Miller as Steemie and Bzermikitokolok, two denizens of Knowhere;[41][42] Gregg Henry as Quill's grandfather Jason;[43] and Michael Rooker as Yondu Udonta, the former head of the Ravagers and Peter's deceased mentor.[40] Maria Bakalova reprises her voice and motion capture role from the Holiday Special as Cosmo,[44][45] a member of the Guardians who is a sapient dog that developed psionic abilities after being abandoned in outer space by the Soviet Union.[46] Gunn changed Cosmo's gender from male, as depicted in the comics, to female for the film, as a tribute to the character's original inspiration, Laika, a Soviet space dog who became one of the first animals in space.[47] Cosmo was physically portrayed by dog actor Slate,[45] after also doing so for the Holiday Special,[48] and was previously portrayed by dog actor Fred in the first two Guardians films.[49][50] Tara Strong (who voiced Miss Minutes in the Disney+ series Loki) voices Mainframe who was previously voiced by an uncredited Miley Cyrus in Vol. 2.[51][52] Jared Gore provides motion capture for Krugarr, a Ravager who wields sorcery powers and speaks through his sorcery.[53]\n\nAsim Chaudhry voices Teefs, an anthropomorphic walrus; Mikaela Hoover (who played Nova Prime's assistant in the first film) voices Floor, an anthropomorphic rabbit;[34] Daniela Melchior appears as Ura,[38][54] the receptionist at Orgocorp;[40] Miriam Shor and Nico Santos appear as Recorder Vim and Recorder Theel, respectively,[55] the scientifically minded henchmen of the High Evolutionary;[56] Jennifer Holland appears as Administrator Kwol,[57] a security employee of Orgocorp;[40] Kai Zen appears as Phyla, one of the High Evolutionary's Star Child prisoners;[58] Judy Greer (who played Maggie Lang in the first two Ant-Man films) voices War Pig, a cyborg pig and member of the Hell Spawns working for the High Evolutionary;[59] Reinaldo Faberlle voices Behemoth, a cyborg bird and member of the Hell Spawns who also works for the High Evolutionary;[60] Dee Bradley Baker voices Blurp,[61] a furry F'saki that is an unnamed Ravager's pet;[62][63] and Dane DiLiegro appears as an Humanimal octopus drug dealer on Counter-Earth (credited as \"Unsavory Octopus\").[64]\n\nCameo appearances in the film include Lloyd Kaufman as Gridlemop, a Krylorian on Knowhere who partakes in a card game with Kraglin; Pete Davidson as Phlektik, a guard at Arête Laboratories;[65][66] Molly C. Quinn as a Ravager;[67] and writer and director James Gunn as the voice of Lambshank, a deformed experiment of the High Evolutionary that is among those freed by the Guardians of the Galaxy.[68] Gunn originally wrote the role for Stan Lee and planned to have him record Lambshank's voice instead of traveling to Atlanta due to Lee's growing age, before designing the character's face to resemble Lee's. After Lee's death, Gunn chose to take over the role.[69]\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy (2014) writer and director James Gunn stated in November 2014 that, in addition to having the \"basic story\" for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) while working on the first film, he also had ideas for a potential third film.[70] Despite this, he was unsure in June 2015 if he would be involved with a third Guardians film, saying that it would depend on how he felt after making Vol. 2.[71] In April 2016, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, the producer of the Guardians films, said a third film was planned for the franchise as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in \"2020 and beyond\".[72] In March 2017, Gunn said there would be a third film \"for sure. We're trying to figure it out\",[73] soon adding that there were no specific plans for the film yet, but that Marvel would want to make it \"unless something goes horribly—which is always possible, you never know\".[74] He also reiterated that he had not decided whether he would be directing the film, and that he was going to figure out his involvement and his next project \"over the next couple of weeks\".[73] Part of Gunn's reluctance to return to the franchise came from not wanting to work on it without Michael Rooker, whose character from the first two films, Yondu Udonta, died at the end of Vol. 2.[75]\n\n\"In the end, my love for Rocket, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Yondu, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula—and some of the other forthcoming heroes—goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine, and I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit.\"\n\nGunn announced in April 2017 that he would return to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. He said the film would be set after Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), and would \"conclude the story of this iteration of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and help catapult both old and new Marvel characters into the next ten years and beyond\".[76] He also felt that the three Guardians films would \"work together as a whole\", telling one story,[77] with the third film \"tying a lot of stuff together\" from the first two and giving \"a lot of answers on a lot of different things\".[78] Gunn also planned to work with Marvel on the future of the \"Marvel Cosmic Universe\".[76] He was set to begin work on Vol. 3 shortly after completing his work as executive producer and consultant on Infinity War.[79] On returning for the third film, Gunn said, \"I wouldn't have said yes if I didn't have a fairly clear idea of where we were going and what we were going to do. I'm not a guy that's just going to do it if I don't have a vision for it\".[77]\n\nAfter originally including Adam Warlock in his script treatment for Vol. 2, Gunn and Feige noted the importance of the character on the cosmic side of the MCU and hinted that he would make an appearance in Vol. 3.[80] In May 2017, after the release of Vol. 2, Gunn said he would be creating the third film \"over the next three years\",[81] and confirmed that Pom Klementieff would reprise her role as Mantis.[16][82] He also intended to have Elizabeth Debicki reprise her role as Ayesha.[83] By mid-June, Gunn had completed the first draft of his script treatment for the third film, and was considering changing a piece of character info he had placed in the background of the mugshot sequence in the first film (when the Guardians are captured by the Nova Corps).[84] In September, Gunn reiterated that Vol. 3 would be released \"in a little under three years\",[85] as the film had privately been set for release on May 1, 2020.[86] At the end of February 2018, Gunn planned to meet with Mark Hamill about possibly appearing in the film.[87] In April, Chris Pratt was set to reprise his role as Peter Quill / Star-Lord,[16][88] and the following month, Dave Bautista confirmed that he would reprise his role as Drax the Destroyer.[89] Marvel received the completed first draft of the screenplay from Gunn by the end of June, ahead of the beginning of official pre-production on the film.[90]\n\nOn July 20, 2018, Disney and Marvel severed ties with Gunn. This came after conservative commentators, such as Mike Cernovich, began circulating old tweets he had made regarding controversial topics such as rape and pedophilia, and called for his firing.[91][92] The Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn stated, \"The offensive attitudes and statements discovered on James' Twitter feed are indefensible and inconsistent with our studio's values, and we have severed our business relationship with him\".[91] While not part of the decision to fire Gunn, the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger supported the \"unanimous decision\" from the various executives at Marvel and Walt Disney Studios.[93] In response, Gunn said in a series of tweets that when he started his career he was \"making movies and telling jokes that were outrageous and taboo\" but felt as he has \"developed as a person, so has my work and my humor\". He continued, \"It's not to say I'm better, but I am very, very different than I was a few years ago; today I try to root my work in love and connection and less in anger. My days saying something just because it's shocking and trying to get a reaction are over\". In a separate statement, Gunn said the tweets at the time were \"totally failed and unfortunate efforts to be provocative\", adding \"I understand and accept the business decisions taken today. Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then\".[91]\n\nIn response to the firing, many of the Guardians cast members tweeted support for Gunn. Rooker decided to leave Twitter,[94][95] while fans signed an online petition asking for Gunn to be reinstated which received over 300,000 signatures.[96] The firing also garnered reaction from other Hollywood personalities, such as actress Selma Blair and comedian Bobcat Goldthwait,[95] and inspired opinion pieces on the firing and how it would affect Hollywood from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,[97] and news organizations such as The Hollywood Reporter,[98] Variety,[99] Deadline Hollywood,[100] and Forbes.[101] On July 30, the cast of the Guardians of the Galaxy films, including Pratt, Zoe Saldaña, Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Sean Gunn, Klementieff, Rooker, and Karen Gillan, issued a statement in support of James Gunn, saying, \"We fully support James Gunn. We were all shocked by his abrupt firing last week and have intentionally waited these ten days to respond in order to think, pray, listen, and discuss. In that time, we've been encouraged by the outpouring of support from fans and members of the media who wish to see James reinstated as director of Volume 3 as well as discouraged by those so easily duped into believing the many outlandish conspiracy theories surrounding him\".[96] Despite this and the notable \"vociferous support\" Gunn received, Variety reported that Disney was not planning to rehire him as the jokes were \"unacceptable in the #MeToo era and are not in line with Disney's family-friendly image\". Variety continued that, despite rumors of Gunn being replaced by established Marvel directors such as Jon Favreau, Taika Waititi, or the Russo brothers, Marvel had yet to meet with any other director, and would most likely hire someone new.[102] In early August, Bautista said that he would fulfill his contract and appear in the film as long as Marvel chose to use Gunn's existing script.[103]\n\nDisney and Marvel still wanted to \"move forward quickly\" on the film,[104] and were soon confirmed to be keeping Gunn's script. This, combined with the fact that Gunn did not breach his contract since the tweets were written years before he signed on to the film, had led to \"complicated negotiations\" between Gunn and Disney over his exit settlement. Gunn was expected to be paid $7–10 million or more, and there was some hope that the negotiations could lead to him eventually returning in some capacity, \"even if [it was] to develop and direct another Marvel movie\". Gunn would be free to move on to new projects following the settlement, and other major studios were interested in hiring him including Warner Bros. for their rival superhero franchise, the DC Extended Universe (DCEU).[105] During this time, executives at Marvel Studios began \"back channel conversations\" with Disney in an attempt to find a compromise that could lead to Gunn returning to the film in some way. This \"eleventh-hour\" effort from Marvel was inspired by the statements from the film's cast.[104] In mid-August, Gunn met with Horn following a strong push from Gunn's talent agency for him to be given a second chance. Despite this and the reported \"civil and professional\" nature of the meeting, Horn only took it as a courtesy and used it to reaffirm Disney's decision to fire Gunn.[106]\n\nLater in August, the small crew that was preparing for pre-production were dismissed as production of the film was postponed so Marvel and Disney could find a director to replace Gunn.[107] Pre-production was to have begun by the end of 2018, with principal photography set for January or February 2019.[107][108] At this time, Bautista was unsure if he would return for the film, as he did not know if he would \"want to work for Disney\" given how they handled the firing of Gunn.[109] In late September, James Gunn's brother Sean, who played Kraglin Obfonteri and provided motion capture for Rocket in the previous Guardians films, reiterated that Disney still intended on making the film with James's script, but had not revealed to the cast when production may continue. Sean added that he had been preparing to reprise his roles for the third film before his brother's firing.[25] At the end of the month, Cooper was asked if he would consider directing Vol. 3 after the success of his directorial debut A Star Is Born (2018), but said that he \"could never imagine\" directing a film that he did not write.[110] By mid-October, James Gunn had completed his exit settlement with Disney and was set to write and potentially direct The Suicide Squad (2021) for Warner Bros. and DC Films.[111]\n\nThe day after Gunn joined The Suicide Squad in mid-October 2018, he was privately notified by Horn that he could return as director for Vol. 3. This came after further meetings between the studios and Gunn. Horn had changed his mind after being impressed by Gunn's response to the situation.[112][113] Gunn discussed his commitments to The Suicide Squad with Feige,[112] and production on Vol. 3 was put on hold until February 2021 to allow Gunn to complete The Suicide Squad first.[113][114][115] In December, after working with Marvel Studios on the script for Ant-Man (2015), Adam McKay said he was willing to work with the studio again and stated that he had discussed taking over as director for Vol. 3 with Feige, among other projects.[116] In early 2019, Feige and Pratt reiterated that Marvel would still make Vol. 3,[117][118] and in March 2019, Gunn was publicly revealed to have been rehired as director of the film. Deadline Hollywood stated that Marvel Studios had \"never met with or considered any other director\" for the film.[113] By the end of April, the franchise's five main stars—Pratt, Saldaña, Bautista, Cooper, and Diesel—were all expected to return for the sequel, with filming to take place in 2020.[5]\n\nDiscussing his firing and re-hiring in May 2019, Gunn said that of all the elements of the film that he had been sad to leave when he was fired, the most meaningful to him was the character of Rocket. Gunn personally identifies with Rocket, describing himself and the character as \"the same\".[19] He had actually grown to love the character since working on the first film due to feeling that an origin story for Rocket could justify what a Bugs Bunny-like \"goofy character\" like him could exist in the MCU if it were the saddest one in the universe, crediting it as the \"seed\" of the trilogy. While Vol. 3 effectively reveals Rocket's backstory through flashbacks akin to those from the story structure of The Godfather Part II (1974), Gunn initially considered telling Rocket's origins in a team-up movie between him and Groot without the other Guardians. He was eventually convinced to make a third Guardians-centric film instead of the Rocket and Groot film but chose to use it to tell Rocket's story.[119][120] That month, Gillan confirmed that she was returning for the sequel and expressed excitement for Gunn's return to the franchise.[13] In June, Saldaña was asked about her role in the film after her character Gamora was killed in Infinity War, and she returned to play a younger version in Endgame who travels through time to the present. Saldaña said that Gamora's fate would depend on the plans that Marvel and Gunn have for Vol. 3, but that she would like to see Gamora rejoin the Guardians and also be portrayed as \"the most lethal woman in the galaxy\" as she has been referred to previously.[7] Gunn was asked in October if he was unhappy about Marvel's decision to kill Gamora in Infinity War and said he was not, adding that he had discussed the storyline with the studio beforehand.[121] According to Infinity War and Endgame screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, Gamora was brought back in Endgame specifically so that Gunn could include her in Vol. 3.[8]\n\nIn December 2019, Gunn was asked if he would have Yondu return in the film and said as long as he was involved with the Guardians characters, he would not have the character be resurrected. Gunn felt the stakes of a character's death were important and said characters who die in his films would likely remain dead.[122] Gunn said in February 2020 that bringing Yondu back to life would \"nullify Yondu's sacrifice\" in Vol. 2, and said the character would not return unless it was for a prequel or flashback;[123] Gunn later said Yondu would not be resurrected in the film to not diminish his death's meaning.[124] In April, Gunn said the COVID-19 pandemic would not affect production plans for the film at that time,[125] saying the next month that the film would be released \"a little after 2021\".[86] In August, Gunn turned in a new draft of the film's script and began writing a spin-off television series from The Suicide Squad titled Peacemaker (2022).[126] A month later, he was planning to begin work on Vol. 3 in 2021 after completing that film and series.[127] He confirmed in November that the script for Vol. 3 was finished,[128] and said that very little had changed from his initial ideas despite the production setbacks.[129] The film was given a 2023 release date a month later,[130] with filming set to begin in late 2021.[129][131] Shortly after, it was revealed to also be set after The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022).[132]\n\nPre-production work creating the designs and visuals for the film began by April 2021.[133] In early May, Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released on May 5, 2023.[134] Later that month, Gunn said Vol. 3 would take place after the events of Thor: Love and Thunder (2022), which features several Guardians characters.[135] That film concludes the storyline established in Endgame which sees Thor journey off with the Guardians. Gunn noted this ending was decided upon \"in editing\" and conflicted with his already-submitted screenplay for Vol. 3, since he never planned to feature Thor in the film.[136] Gunn had begun storyboarding the film by June,[137] with filming later revealed to begin in November 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia for an expected end around April 2022.[138][139][140] By then, Bautista said he had not read a script for Vol. 3 and was unsure if it had changed during the production delays.[138] The next month, Gillan said that she and Klementieff had read the script together and she found it to be incredible, brilliant, emotional, and funny. She also felt it was Gunn's \"strongest work yet\" with the Guardians characters.[141] Gunn reiterated that the script had \"basically stayed the same\" from three years prior but he had been \"playing with it in little ways\" over the years. He was in the middle of another draft by the end of the month and said the film would be emotional and have a \"heavier\" story than the previous films,[140][142] with a more grounded approach that was inspired by The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker.[143] An early option Gunn had in mind for the character who would become the film's main villain and be revealed to be the one who created Rocket was the Fantastic Four villain Annihilus, but Gunn ultimately opted to fill that role with the High Evolutionary.[144] Gunn originally wrote a cameo appearance for Kumail Nanjiani, a friend of his, but removed this after learning Nanjiani was cast as Kingo in Marvel Studios' Eternals (2021).[145]\n\nBy late August, Gunn and Marvel Studios began meeting with actors for the role of Adam Warlock, including Will Poulter,[22] who auditioned for the role over Zoom before an in-person screen test with Gunn in Atlanta.[146] Poulter initially knew the character had been teased at the end of Vol. 2, but was not told the character's name until he was \"drip-fed\" information about Warlock's \"steeped\" comic book history with the High Evolutionary.[147] George MacKay had also been on the shortlist and Regé-Jean Page was considered for the part,[22][148] while David Corenswet also auditioned and Aaron Pierre was almost cast in the role. They were later cast by Gunn for the DC Universe (DCU) franchise, respectively as the DC Comics characters Superman in the film Superman (2025) and John Stewart / Green Lantern in the television series Lanterns.[149][150] In September, Gillan reiterated her positive comments about the script and said the film would explore the characters from the previous Guardians films on a deeper level,[151] while Seth Green, who voices Howard the Duck in the MCU, said the film would be about Gamora and Nebula's story. He did not know at that time if Howard would appear after doing so in the previous Guardians films.[152] Poulter was cast as Adam Warlock in October,[22][148] and Gunn said \"dozens of roles\" had already been cast.[153] Poulter was chosen for the part because of his dramatic and comedic abilities and because Gunn \"wanted somebody who was youthful\" and would fit with Marvel Studios' future plans for the character.[23] Casting also took place for various background roles, including aliens and security guards.[154][155] Pratt began rehearsals and camera tests later that month,[156] and a production meeting was held in early November, shortly before the start of filming. Gunn also reiterated his comments on not resurrecting Yondu in the film.[157]\n\nPrincipal photography began on November 8, 2021,[158] at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia,[155][159] under the working title Hot Christmas.[115] Henry Braham served as cinematographer, after doing so for Vol. 2, The Suicide Squad,  and The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special.[160] Filming was previously scheduled to begin in January or February 2019 prior to Gunn's firing,[107][108] and then in February 2021,[115] before Gunn began work on Peacemaker.[127] With the start of filming, Sylvester Stallone revealed that he would return as Stakar Ogord from Vol. 2,[37] and Gunn posted a photo of the main cast members which revealed that Chukwudi Iwuji was part of the film following his collaboration with Gunn on Peacemaker.[158][161] Iwuji's screen test for the film was shot on the set of Peacemaker with that series' crew, and Marvel repaid this favor by letting Gunn use the Vol. 3 set and crew to film Ezra Miller's cameo appearance as Barry Allen / The Flash for the Peacemaker season finale.[143]\n\nProduction designer Beth Mickle said Gunn chose to mainly use practical effects for Vol. 3 after they did so with their work on The Suicide Squad.[162] In February 2021, Gunn stated the film would be shot using Industrial Light & Magic's StageCraft virtual production technology that was developed for the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian,[163] but in October, he said they would not be able to use the technology because the sets were too big,[164] believing they were larger than the sets used on The Suicide Squad.[165] The interior of the Guardians' new ship, the Bowie, was a four-story set.[166] Judianna Makovsky served as costume designer.[167] The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special was filmed at the same time as Vol. 3,[15][168] from February to late April 2022,[169][170] with the same main cast and sets.[132][142][166] Gunn enjoyed being able to switch to filming the special after doing scenes for Vol. 3, given the tonal difference between the two with Vol. 3 being more \"emotional\",[171] feeling it helped provide a \"relief\" to the actors as well,[15] and called the Holiday Special shoot easier than Vol. 3.[166] In February 2022, Callie Brand was revealed to appear in the film as an alien.[63] Shooting was also expected to occur in London, England, in late 2021.[172] Vol. 3 is the first MCU film to feature the word \"fuck\" uncensored; it is spoken by Quill. The dialogue \"Open the fucking door\" was not scripted, but improvised by Pratt on Gunn's suggestion,[173][174][175] although, there was some consideration over giving the one-liner to Groot instead.[176] Gunn was inspired by the Korean film The Villainess (2017) for the action scenes in Vol. 3.[177] Filming on Vol. 3 wrapped on May 6, 2022.[178]\n\nIn early June 2022, Daniela Melchior was revealed to have a small role in the film, after previously starring in The Suicide Squad. Debicki was also confirmed to be reprising her role as Ayesha,[38] while Maria Bakalova and Nico Santos were also revealed to be appearing in the film.[179][180] In July, Iwuji and Bakalova were revealed to be portraying the High Evolutionary and Cosmo the Spacedog, respectively.[46] Cosmo was physically portrayed by dog actor Fred in the first two Guardians films,[49][50] and Slate in the Holiday Special and Vol. 3.[45][48] The following month, Michael Rosenbaum revealed that he had reprised his role as Martinex from Vol. 2 in the film.[39] In October 2022, it was revealed that Bakalova would appear as Cosmo in the Holiday Special ahead of her role in Vol. 3.[181] In February 2023, Asim Chaudhry revealed he had a role in the film,[182] voicing Teefs,[34] and in April, Linda Cardellini and Tara Strong were revealed to have respectively voiced Lylla and Mainframe.[34][51] Cardellini previously appeared in multiple MCU projects as Laura Barton, starred in the Gunn-written films Scooby-Doo (2002) and Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004), and had a cameo in Gunn's film Super (2010),[34] while Strong replaced Miley Cyrus, who voiced Mainframe in Vol. 2, due to Cyrus being unavailable.[183] Two days of reshoots occurred.[20]\n\nThe visual effects were provided by Framestore, Wētā FX, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Industrial Light & Magic, Rodeo FX, Rise FX, Crafty Apes, BUF, Lola VFX, Perception, and Compuhire.[184] Stephane Ceretti returned from the first film to serve as the visual effects supervisor,[185] while Fred Raskin returned from the first two films to serve as the editor,[186] alongside Greg D'Auria, who returned from the Holiday Special.[187] Additional editing was provided by Tatiana S. Riegel.[188]\n\nIn April 2017, Gunn felt the music for the film would be different from what was used for the first two films' soundtracks, Awesome Mix Vol. 1 and Vol. 2.[77] The next month, he added that he was \"panicking\" about the soundtrack and had to make some \"pretty specific choices\" shortly due to the wider range of available music for the story,[189] By early July 2017, Gunn had narrowed down his choices for potential songs to 181, but noted that this list could grow again.[190] All of the songs for the film had been selected by the following month;[191] the songs are not modern and come from Quill's Zune that he received at the end of Vol. 2,[192] although Gunn added that the soundtrack was not limited to 1970s pop songs compared to the first two films,[24] instead spanning multiple decades.[136] Gunn was unable to use the song \"Russian Roulette\" by the Lords of the New Church for Vol. 3 due to a legal battle over its ownership.[193][194] The film opens with an acoustic version of \"Creep\" by Radiohead, which provided \"a much different tone from the beginning than the other two films\".[136] The film ends with \"Dog Days Are Over\" by Florence and the Machine, as Gunn is a fan of its album Lungs; he had thought about including the song to wrap-up the trilogy since he started writing Vol. 2.[12]\n\nThe track list for Awesome Mix Vol. 3 was revealed in April 2023,[195] and was made available on Spotify and Apple Music on April 3 as part of a larger Guardians of the Galaxy: The Official Mixtape playlist, which also featured the soundtracks and scores from the previous two films.[195][196] Awesome Mix Vol. 3 was released by Hollywood Records on CD and digital download on May 3, 2023, a 12\" 2-LP vinyl on May 5, and on cassette on July 7.[197]\n\nIn October 2021, Gunn revealed that John Murphy was composing the film's score and had already recorded music to be played on set during filming.[198][199] Murphy replaces Tyler Bates, who composed the score for the first two films. However, Bates' theme from the previous films were referenced; Murphy had also replaced Bates as composer of The Suicide Squad after Bates left that film during production.[200] Murphy's original score for the film was released digitally on May 3, 2023.[197]\n\nThe film was discussed during Marvel Studios' panel at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, where the first footage was revealed. Iwuji was also announced as playing the High Evolutionary, appearing at the panel in costume.[46] Gunn stated the footage was not released publicly because the visual effects were not complete enough for \"repeated views and close inspection\".[201] An official trailer was released on December 1, 2022, during the CCXP.[27] It featured \"In the Meantime\" by Spacehog. Drew Taylor of TheWrap called the trailer a doozy, thrilling, and emotional, and stated that \"Gunn's patented, rollicking 'Guardians of the Galaxy' tone is very much in place\", and noted \"an undercurrent of extreme melancholy\".[202] Carson Burton of Variety predicted from the trailer that the film would be \"shaping up to be an emotional ending\" by showing Rocket's memories and Star-Lord missing Gamora.[27] Jay Peters at The Verge said the trailer intrigued him as a \"wild ride across the stars\" with different planets.[203]\n\nA second trailer for the film was released during Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023. It featured \"Since You Been Gone\" by Rainbow.[204] Grant Hermanns of Screen Rant felt the trailer gave \"a deeper look\" at the film, particularly Adam Warlock's powers as compared to his brief appearance in the first one. Hermanns also said the second trailer \"goes a step further in highlighting the emotional story\" after the first one \"efficiently set [the film's] tone, featuring plenty of melancholic shots of the [Guardians of the Galaxy] facing the music\".[205] The trailer accumulated 134.1 million views across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, and was the most-watched Super Bowl trailer in post-game day traffic according to RelishMix. It was also the first time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic that a Super Bowl trailer exceeded 100 million views on social media in a 24-hour period.[206]\n\nDisney and Marvel Music partnered with Spotify in May 2023, to promote the film. As part of the promotion, a playlist, titled the \"K-GOTG Radio Experience\", was created on the platform.[207] Marvel Studios also promoted the film with General Mills limited-edition cereals and snacks, including Honey Nut Cheerios, Cookie Crisp, Lucky Charms, Trix, Reese's Puffs, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and Go-Gurt.[208] Microsoft also partnered with Marvel Studios to promote the film with a limited-edition Zune MP3 player; a single non-functional model would be created using 3D printing and launched inside the International Space Station.[209]\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 had an early screening at Dongdaemun Design Plaza on April 19, 2023.[210] The film premiered at Disneyland Paris on April 22, 2023,[211][212] and its North American premiere was held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 27.[213] The film was released in several countries including the United Kingdom on May 3, 2023,[214][177] and in the United States on May 5.[134] It was originally set for release on May 1, 2020,[86] before it was dropped from that date.[215] It is part of Phase Five of the MCU.[46] The film was released in 3D, IMAX, Dolby Cinema, 4DX, and ScreenX.[216] Disney released over 600 unique versions of the film to theaters, including a version with variable aspect ratios. Forty-five minutes of the film was presented in the flat 1.85:1 aspect ratio, while the rest of the film is in the 2.39:1 letterboxed aspect ratio.[217]\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on digital download on July 7, 2023; on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 1;[218] and on Disney+ on August 2,[219] where an IMAX Enhanced version was also available.[220] The film was the final physical media release for Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in Australia, as they decided to discontinue selling their films on physical home media there.[221]\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 grossed $358.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $486.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $845.6 million.[3] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $124 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.[222]\n\nIn the US and Canada, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was projected to gross around $110 million from 4,450 theaters in its opening weekend.[210] The film made $48.2 million on its first day,[223] including $17.5 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut with $118.4 million, topping the box office.[224] In its second weekend, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 retained the top spot at the box office with $62 million,[225][226][227] a 48% decline from its opening weekend and the best second-weekend hold of any sequel in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and a notably smaller second-weekend decline than those of the franchise's recent releases, including Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (70%), Thor: Love and Thunder (68%), and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (67%).[227][228] The film made $32 million in its third weekend, being dethroned by Fast X.[229]\n\nOutside the US and Canada, the film grossed $168.1 million in its opening weekend.[230] In its second weekend, the film grossed $92 million for a drop of 40% from its opening weekend.

The site's critics consensus reads: \"A galactic group hug that might squeeze a little too tight on the heartstrings, the final Guardians of the Galaxy is a loving last hurrah for the MCU's most ragtag family.\"[232] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 63 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[233] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, the same as the previous two Guardians films, while PostTrak reported that moviegoers gave the film a 91% positive score, with 79% saying they would definitely recommend it.[224]\n\nThe Independent found it was \"the best Marvel movie in years\"[234] as did Vox[235] and the CBC.[236] In mixed reviews, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian[237] and Nicholas Barber of the BBC agreed the film was overlong, Barber opining that \"the film's saving grace is that, just as Gunn has been allowed to unleash his gonzo imagination, he has also been allowed to pour out his emotions.\"[238] Wendy Ide of The Observer lauded the films for its emotional weight and deemed it a satisfying conclusion, stating that \"What elevates Vol 3 (supposedly the final film in the GOTG series) is the way it keeps that personality, nodding to the irreverent swagger that is a crucial component of the Guardians USP while delivering a series of devastating emotional sucker punches along the way.\"[239] Matt Singer from ScreenCrush praised the film for concluding Rocket's arc story stating that \"a character tells Rocket that the events unfolding onscreen have been his story all along — and with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, it does feel like Marvel has spent $200 million on a movie about a melancholy space raccoon looking for love and acceptance.\"[240]\n\nWriting for The Verge, Charles Pulliam-Moore praised the film's action sequences and storyline and commented that \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 tells the action-packed, flashback-filled story of how Rocket Raccoon's (Bradley Cooper) life being gravely endangered gives the rest of the Guardians a reason to come together and really start working on some of the emotional issues that've been haunting them since Endgame.\"[241] The Hindustan Times praised Gunn's direction and writing, commenting that \"As James Gunn concludes his journey with these characters he clearly cares so deeply about, you can't help but reflect on your own. Walking out, I had my own little flashback montage playing in my head of all the adventures we've been on and foes we've faced with this lovable group of galaxy-saving idiots.\"[242] Nathan Durr of CBS News praised the film's soundtrack and stated that \"There's no exception here regarding the soundtrack as Gunn and company cleverly implement songs that add weight to the complexities and emotions of the characters.\"[243]\n\nA negative review from NPR criticized the approach of cruelty to animals in the film,[244] while The New York Times called it a \"dour, visually off-putting two-and-a-half-hour A.S.P.C.A. nightmare of a film (that) may only be for completionist fans\",[245] and the Chicago Tribune, \"the most empty, brutal MCU movie yet\".[246] Conversely, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) declared the film to be \"the best animal rights film of the year\", and gave Gunn a \"Not a Number Award\" for his depiction of animal testing.[247]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced.[283] The special on this film, \"The Making of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\", was released on Disney+ on September 13, 2023.[284]\n\nGunn said in April 2017 that a fourth Guardians film could happen, although, it would likely center on a new group of characters since Gunn planned to conclude the story of the current team in Vol. 3.[285] Later in September, Gunn said he was unlikely to return for another Guardians film but would continue to work with Marvel Studios on other projects that use the Guardians and cosmic characters.[286] One such project from Gunn was a film centered on Drax and Mantis, which Bautista called \"brilliant\". However, in May 2021, Bautista stated that he had not heard any further updates regarding it, feeling Marvel Studios was not \"very interested, or it doesn't fit into the way they have things mapped out\".[287] Gunn confirmed in September 2019 that he intended for Vol. 3 to be his last Guardians film,[288] which he reaffirmed in May 2021.[289] In July 2021, Gillan expressed her desire to continue playing Nebula after Vol. 3.[290] In April 2023, Saldaña confirmed that Vol. 3 would be the last time she portrays Gamora, but hoped Marvel would recast the role with a younger actor because she wished for the character to continue.[10]\n\nPratt indicated in May 2023 that he was willing to continue playing Peter Quill if the right script came along,[291] and a note at the end of Vol. 3's post-credits scene states that the \"Legendary Star-Lord\" will return to the MCU.[43] In December 2024, Gunn said he had given his blessing to Pratt to continue in the role without him, and he was excited for Marvel to use the Guardians again in future projects. He noted that there were planned spin-offs that did not eventuate but still could without his involvement, including a television series focused on the Ravagers and a project that he called \"Legendary Star-Lord\" which they \"had a whole idea for\".[120]\n"

        "title": "WandaVision",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision",
        "content": "\n\nWandaVision is an American television miniseries created by Jac Schaeffer for the streaming service Disney+, based on Marvel Comics featuring the characters Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch and Vision. It is the first television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) produced by Marvel Studios, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise, and is set after the events of the film Avengers: Endgame (2019). It follows Wanda Maximoff and Vision as they live an idyllic suburban life in the town of Westview, New Jersey, until their reality starts moving through different decades of sitcom homages and television tropes. Schaeffer served as head writer for the series, which was directed by Matt Shakman.\n\nElizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany reprise their respective roles as Wanda and Vision from the film series, with Debra Jo Rupp, Fred Melamed, Kathryn Hahn, Teyonah Parris, Randall Park, Kat Dennings, and Evan Peters also starring. By September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing a number of limited series for Disney+ centered on supporting characters from the MCU films such as Wanda and Vision, with Olsen and Bettany returning. Schaeffer was hired in January 2019, with the series officially announced that April, and Shakman joining in August. The production used era-appropriate sets, costumes, and effects to recreate the different sitcom styles that the series pays homage to. Filming began in Atlanta, Georgia, in November 2019, before production halted in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed in Los Angeles in September 2020 and wrapped that November.\n\nWandaVision premiered with its first two episodes on January 15, 2021, and ran for nine episodes, concluding on March 5. It is the first series, and the beginning, of Phase Four of the MCU. The series received praise from critics for its homages to past sitcoms and for the performances of its cast, especially those of Olsen, Bettany, and Hahn, though there was criticism for the finale. It was widely discussed and analyzed by fans based on various popular theories, as well as by commentators for its exploration of grief and nostalgia. The series received numerous accolades, including 23 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning three. Olsen reprised her role in the film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022), which continues Wanda's story from WandaVision, while the spin-off series Agatha All Along premiered in September 2024 and focuses on Hahn's Agatha Harkness. Another spin-off focusing on Bettany's Vision, Vision Quest, is scheduled to be released in 2026.\n\nThree weeks after the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019),[1] Wanda Maximoff and Vision are living an idyllic suburban life in the town of Westview, New Jersey, trying to conceal their true natures. As their surroundings begin to move through different decades and they encounter various television tropes, the couple suspects that things are not as they seem.[2]\n\nRecurring residents of Westview include Asif Ali as Abilash Tandon who plays Vision's co-worker \"Norm\"; David Lengel as Harold Proctor who plays \"Phil Jones\";[41][42] Amos Glick as a pizza delivery man cast as \"Dennis\", the mailman/delivery man;[41][43] Ithamar Enriquez and Victoria Blade as residents cast as the commercial man and woman actors;[41][44] Emma Caulfield Ford as Sarah Proctor, Harold's wife who plays \"Dottie Jones\", a \"skeptical mom who rules the neighborhood with an iron fist and poison smile\";[45][46] and David Payton as John Collins who plays \"Herb\".[19][41] Josh Stamberg also recurs as S.W.O.R.D. acting director Tyler Hayward,[47] along with Alan Heckner and Selena Anduze as S.W.O.R.D. agents Monti and Rodriguez.[48] Julian Hilliard and Jett Klyne portray Wanda and Vision's sons Billy and Tommy, respectively.[49]\n\nAdditional guest stars include Jolene Purdy as Isabel Matsueda who plays Wanda and Vision's neighbor \"Beverly\";[41][50] frequent MCU stuntman Zac Henry as Franklin, a S.W.O.R.D. agent who becomes a beekeeper when he enters Wanda's reality;[51] Randy Oglesby as a Westview resident who plays \"Stan Nielson\", the town's doctor;[52] Wesley Kimmel and Sydney Thomas as the boy and girl in the commercials;[53] and Kate Forbes as Agatha's mother, Evanora Harkness. Ilana Kohanchi and Daniyar portray the Maximoffs' parents Iryna and Olek Maximoff, respectively,[54] while Gabriel Gurevich plays a young version of her brother Pietro.[12]\n\nNewlywed couple Wanda Maximoff and Vision move into the town of Westview in a black-and-white setting that recalls classic 1950s and 1960s sitcoms. They attempt to blend in despite Vision being an android and Wanda having telekinesis and reality-warping abilities. One day they notice a heart drawn on their calendar, but cannot remember what the occasion is. While Vision goes to his job at Computational Services Inc., Wanda decides that the heart represents their anniversary. Their neighbor Agnes introduces herself to Wanda and helps her prepare to celebrate that night. Vision amazes his co-workers with his speed but is unsure what his company actually does. He is reminded that the heart represents plans for him and Wanda to host his boss, Mr. Hart, and his wife for dinner. Wanda and Vision struggle to hide their abilities while making a last-minute dinner. While interrogating Wanda and Vision, Mr. Hart chokes on his food and Vision uses his abilities to save him. All of this takes place in the fictional sitcom WandaVision which someone is watching on a television.\n\nIn a 1960s setting, Wanda and Vision hear strange noises outside their house. They prepare their magic act for a neighborhood talent show. Wanda and Agnes spend the day with the show's planning committee, led by Dottie, and Vision attends a neighborhood watch meeting, where he accidentally swallows some chewing gum. Wanda befriends another neighbor, Geraldine, and notices more strange things: a yellow and red toy helicopter in their black-and-white world; a voice on the radio that seems to be speaking to her; and a red bloodstain. Thanks to the gum caught in his internal mechanisms, Vision appears to be intoxicated at the talent show and publicly reveals his abilities. Wanda uses her own abilities to make this look like simple magic tricks and fixes Vision by removing the gum. They return home, and Wanda becomes visibly pregnant. When they see a strange beekeeper emerging from a manhole on their street, Wanda resets their reality to before the figure appears. The setting changes to full color as it moves to the 1970s.\n\nIn the 1970s setting, Dr. Nielson says Wanda is four months pregnant and everything is fine before leaving for an intended holiday with his wife. While Vision sees Nielson out, he sees his neighbor Herb unknowingly cut through their wall. Wanda and Vision paint a nursery while debating what to name their child before Wanda's pregnancy elevates to six months. When she begins contractions, her abilities begin to move things in the house and eventually shut down the entire town's power. Geraldine arrives and helps Wanda deliver twins Billy and Tommy. Vision catches Agnes and Herb gossiping outside. They talk about Geraldine, who has just arrived in town and does not have a home or family. Inside, Wanda interrogates Geraldine after the latter reveals that she knows Ultron killed Wanda's twin brother Pietro.[a] Wanda notices that Geraldine is wearing a pendant with a sword emblem on it. When Vision returns, Geraldine is gone. Outside of Westview, Geraldine emerges through a wall of static and is surrounded by S.W.O.R.D. agents.\n\nIn a 1980s/early 1990s setting, Wanda and Vision struggle to stop Billy and Tommy from crying. Agnes offers to help look after the boys, but Vision questions her behavior. He and Wanda are interrupted when Billy and Tommy suddenly age-up to 5 years old. When a dog appears at their house, the boys ask to keep it and Agnes suggests the name Sparky. Wanda almost reveals her abilities to Agnes, concerning Vision, while the boys age-up again to 10 years old. At work, Vision reads an email from S.W.O.R.D. that reveals the situation in Westview. He breaks through to a real Westview resident and learns that Wanda is controlling the town. S.W.O.R.D. sends a drone from the 1980s into Westview which causes Sparky to run off. Hayward orders the drone be used to kill Wanda, but she emerges from the barrier with it and warns Hayward to leave her alone. Agnes finds Sparky dead. Vision confronts Wanda about her actions, but they are interrupted when \"Pietro\" arrives. Watching the broadcast, Lewis notes that Pietro has been \"recast\".\n\nIn a late 1990s/early 2000s setting, Wanda wants to spend Tommy and Billy's first Halloween together as a family, but Vision tells her that he is going to patrol the streets with the neighborhood watch. \"Pietro\" offers to step in as a father figure and takes the boys trick-or-treating, causing mischief with his super speed, which Tommy is revealed to have inherited. Meanwhile, Vision explores further away from their house and finds residents of Westview standing frozen in their positions, including Agnes. Vision speaks to Agnes' real self and she tells him that he is dead. Outside Westview, Hayward orders Rambeau, Lewis, and Woo to leave the base for disagreeing with his decision to attack Wanda, but they sneak inside and hack into his computer to discover that he has been tracking Vision's vibranium signature. Vision tries to push through the static wall, but he begins to disintegrate. Billy senses this with his own telepathic powers and tells Wanda, who expands the hexagonal static wall. Vision, Lewis, and several S.W.O.R.D. agents are enveloped by the new boundary.\n\nIn a mid-to-late 2000s setting, Wanda decides to have a day to herself and Agnes agrees to babysit Tommy and Billy. Wanda sees various parts of her house constantly changing and is unable to control them. Vision wakes up to find the S.W.O.R.D. agents inside the boundary are now members of a circus. He releases Lewis from the spell and she tells Vision about his death and the events that led to the current situation. Outside of Westview, Rambeau and Woo meet with loyal S.W.O.R.D. personnel and obtain a vehicle designed to cross the barrier. When the tactic proves unsuccessful, Rambeau decides to enter herself. She passes through the static wall and emerges with seemingly heightened vision. Rambeau confronts Wanda, but Agnes tells Rambeau to leave and takes Wanda to her house. Wanda looks for the boys in the basement and discovers a strange lair. Agnes introduces herself as a witch named Agatha Harkness and reveals that she has been disrupting Wanda's life, including sending an imposter as \"Pietro\" and killing Sparky.\n\nBy September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for its parent company Disney's streaming service, Disney+, to be centered on supporting characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films who had not starred in their own films, such as Wanda Maximoff. Actors who portrayed the characters in the films were expected to reprise their roles for the limited series, including Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda. The series for Disney+ were expected to be six to eight episodes each, have a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\", and be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, which produced previous MCU television series. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each limited series' development,[55] focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.[56] Brian Chapek, a director of production & development and creative executive at Marvel Studios, began initial work on a Wanda series before co-executive producer Mary Livanos joined the project in mid-2018 and took over the series' development.[25][57] By the end of October, Paul Bettany's Vision was expected to play a significant role in the series, which would focus on the relationship between Wanda and Vision.[58] In the following months, the titles Vision and the Scarlet Witch and The Vision and Scarlet Witch were both reported.[59][60][61]\n\nFeige came up with the idea of having Wanda and Vision living in a fantasy world of \"suburban bliss\", based on his love of sitcoms and how they can be used to escape from reality.[2] When he was meeting with potential head writers for the series, some did not feel his proposed sitcom element would work. Jac Schaeffer, who was working on Black Widow (2021) at the time, heard the premise of the series and was excited by it. She had a meeting to pitch her ideas,[62] and was hired as head writer in January 2019.[60][63] Schaeffer was set to write the first episode and executive produce the series.[60] That April, Disney and Marvel officially announced the series as WandaVision,[3] and Matt Shakman was hired to direct and serve as an executive producer in August.[64][65] Feige also executive produces alongside Marvel Studios' Louis D'Esposito and Victoria Alonso.[66]: 50 [67]: 20  Rather than call the series Wanda and Vision or The Scarlet Witch and Vision, Feige was inspired to use a compound title like WandaVision after seeing the title for the film BlacKkKlansman (2018),[25] but he was hesitant about using it. Schaeffer insisted on using the title after hearing it, feeling it was perfect for the series. There was some backlash when the title was announced as it was perceived to be \"the silliest title possible\", but Schaeffer felt viewers would change their minds once they watched the series.[68] Feige said the series would tell the story of Wanda and Vision, show Wanda's full abilities, explore who Vision is, and introduce Wanda's comic book name \"Scarlet Witch\" to the MCU \"in ways that are entirely fun, entirely funny, [and] somewhat scary\". He added that the series would have repercussions for the rest of the MCU's Phase Four,[69] but said viewers would not need to be familiar with the MCU to understand the series. He did think there would be a \"wealth of rewards\" for those who had already seen all the MCU films and knew the plans for Phase Four.[2]\n\nThe series was described as part sitcom, part \"Marvel epic\" by Feige,[70] \"super avant-garde and weird\" by Bettany,[71] an action movie mixed with sitcoms by actor Teyonah Parris,[72] and a combination of superhero action and \"small-town sitcom silliness\" by Livanos.[2] Shakman was \"uniquely equipped\" to direct such a series because of his experience directing series like the psychological drama Mad Men, the large-scale action series Game of Thrones, and sitcoms like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Shakman also felt more qualified to make WandaVision since he was a child actor on 1980s sitcoms such as Just the Ten of Us.[73] The series totals approximately six hours of content across nine episodes,[74][75] which vary from a half-hour comedy format to 50 minutes long.[27][76] During development, the budget was reported to be as much as $25 million per episode.[77]\n\nMuch of the series takes place within a fictional sitcom called WandaVision.[78] Schaeffer received comics material and an outline of what Marvel Studios hoped to accomplish so she could help shape their ideas.[10]: 28  Feige was visually inspired by Mike del Mundo's \"Norman Rockwell meets Leave it to Beaver\" covers for the comic book series The Vision by Tom King and Gabriel Hernandez Walta,[79][80][81] and pitched the series to Olsen and Bettany as a combination of that comic book and the \"House of M\" storyline by Brian Michael Bendis and Olivier Coipel.[65][82] Other inspiration was taken from the Scarlet Witch: Witches' Road trade paperback,[83] the \"Avengers Disassembled\" storyline by Bendis and David Finch that preceded \"House of M\",[81] the \"Vision Quest\" storyline from West Coast Avengers by John Byrne,[84] and the comic book runs of The Vision and the Scarlet Witch by Bill Mantlo and Rick Leonardi,[81][85] and by Steve Englehart and Richard Howell.[81][86]\n\nFeige, Schaeffer, Shakman, and Livanos dedicated themselves to \"nail[ing] down\" the series' irreverent tone.[2] Schaeffer was inspired by the MCU film Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and the Marvel Television X-Men series Legion (2017–19), believing those projects broke the mold of what Marvel stories could be and were daring, original, and \"bananas\". She felt they allowed WandaVision to also be unique and different,[87][88] and noted that it would be the polar opposite to her work on Black Widow which focused on aggressive, visceral action.[89] Schaeffer hired Gretchen Enders, Megan McDonnell, Bobak Esfarjani, Peter Cameron, Mackenzie Dohr, Chuck Hayward, Cameron Squires, and Laura Donney for the series' writers room,[90] a grouping of half men, half women, and several people of color,[89][91] because Schaeffer believed the varying perspectives would create better stories.[89] Each writer had different areas of expertise that they brought to the series and were aided by Schaeffer's assistant Laura Monti and the general writers' assistant Clay Lapari.[90] Staff writer McDonnell was eventually promoted to story editor.[92] Many of the writers had previous television experience, unlike Schaeffer, which helped her with the initial challenge of crafting the limited series' long-form structure as well as each episode within that larger narrative.[10]: 29  Schaeffer believed the story could never have been told with a film format because it needed to establish its sitcom reality with a true television aesthetic before that could be broken.[87]\n\nSchaeffer found the central idea of Wanda being responsible for the sitcom reality to be a simple concept, and felt it would be more compelling if it was revealed through a mystery. This is done by showing Wanda and Vision living in the sitcom reality for the first three episodes before the fourth episode retells those events from a real world perspective to provide answers for viewers.[93] Schaeffer described this as starting in a \"grounded\" sitcom with Twilight Zone \"fraying edges\", followed by a bottle episode to explain the early events.[15] How long the series remained in the sitcom reality before giving answers to viewers was a big concern for Schaeffer.[94] Following the \"enormous info dump\" in the fourth episode, Schaeffer hoped the audience could experience the rest of the series as an \"emotional and a psychological journey, rather than a sneaky mystery the whole way\".[93] She pitched the rest of the series as mixing sitcom and real world elements until the penultimate episode explores Wanda's history and creation of the sitcom reality,[15] concluding in a big finale with the spectacle of an MCU film.[83] She compared the series to a multi-issue comic book and said it remained very close to her original pitch,[10]: 29 [15] which was structured to follow the five stages of grief by starting with denial and ending with acceptance.[40][95] Ten episodes were originally planned, but this was reworked to nine episodes to improve the \"rhythm\".[96] The episode titles come from phrases featured in promotions or the opening credits of television series.[97]\n\nAfter receiving Marvel Studios' initial ideas for the series, Schaeffer helped figure out what they meant for the characters.[65] Shakman and Schaeffer watched all the existing MCU footage of Wanda and Vision, including footage that did not make it into the previous MCU films such as unused dailies.[98] While exploring this footage, Schaeffer was drawn to mundane character moments such as Wanda and Vision cooking paprikash in Captain America: Civil War (2016) and the two enjoying their time together in Scotland in Avengers: Infinity War (2018).[10]: 29 [83] Schaeffer said there was a wonder and sincerity to the pair, and felt their family dynamic within a sitcom setting would result in a calm, warm feeling despite the ridiculous premise of the series.[66]: 45  She found the pair appealing because they are both outsiders who \"find each other. They're both different with capital Ds.\"[2]\n\nWandaVision begins three weeks after the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019),[1] and is set in the fictional town of Westview, New Jersey, which was named as a reference to Feige's hometown of Westfield, New Jersey, but with the initials \"W\" and \"V\".[99] The series shows how Wanda grew up in an Eastern European country and formed a love for the black-market DVDs of American sitcoms that her father sold.[65][100] Schaeffer was excited to use the series to give social commentary while telling a story about character and grief,[40] as she found Wanda's grief to be relatable.[15] A grief counselor was consulted,[40] and Shakman said the entire series was about Wanda learning to process and overcome her grief.[101] Schaeffer was committed to depicting Wanda as a fully realized character, including showing aspects of her that had not been seen much previously in the MCU such as her joy and humor.[87] A great concern for Schaeffer, Livanos, and the writers was avoiding a portrayal of Wanda that made her seem crazy or out of control, as some of her comic book appearances have done, and Schaeffer hoped they gave a \"nuanced portrayal of a very complicated woman\".[88] Olsen believed Schaeffer was one of the first writers to work with Wanda who understood the \"360 of [her] inner and exterior world\".[25]\n\nBy introducing the \"Scarlet Witch\" name as a title linked to chaos magic and a preordained destiny, the series was able to further define magic in the MCU beyond what was introduced in Doctor Strange (2016) without limiting Wanda's character too much. Witchcraft, the Salem witch trials, and what Schaeffer described as \"our sort of Americanized version and feminized version of witches and magic\" were all new additions to the MCU after Doctor Strange introduced what Schaeffer felt was \"more of a masculine magic\".[102] The series also introduces the organization S.W.O.R.D. to the MCU, changing its name from the comic books' Sentient World Observation and Response Department to Sentient Weapon Observation and Response Division. This is due to the organization in the MCU dealing with sentient weapons, such as reconstructing the original Vision with the goal of turning him into a weapon.[17][103] One of the S.W.O.R.D. agents seen in the series is a grown-up Monica Rambeau, who was introduced to the MCU as an eleven-year-old in Captain Marvel (2019).[26] Olsen said Rambeau's material was rewritten during filming as Marvel Studios formed a better understanding of what they wanted to do with the character in the future.[104] Other existing MCU characters Darcy Lewis and Jimmy Woo were added to the series out of the desire to have characters outside of the Hex with a science and law enforcement background, respectively. Initial drafts of the early episodes had more backstory for Lewis that was removed in favor of focusing on the S.W.O.R.D. base when outside of the Hex, though elements of these scenes were added into later episodes.[25] Wanda and Vision's sons Billy and Tommy appear as 10-year-olds in the series. Shakman said there were never plans to make the characters as old as they are in the Young Avengers comic book team since that would deprive Wanda of more time with them.[105]\n\nWandaVision directly sets up Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022),[2] in which Olsen reprises her role as Wanda.[106] Schaeffer said Feige handled the connections between MCU projects, but she and Shakman did have conversations with the creative teams of Multiverse of Madness, Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), and Marvel Studios' other Disney+ series to discuss the connections between stories and ensure an effortless handoff from WandaVision to the films.[88][107][108] Livanos met with Loki executive producers Stephen Broussard and Kevin Wright and What If...? executive producer Brad Winderbaum to establish a \"rule book\" for the multiverse, its branch timelines, and nexus events.[109] Benedict Cumberbatch was originally planned to reprise his role as Dr. Stephen Strange in the WandaVision finale, but he was written out of the series to avoid him taking focus away from Wanda. The Multiverse of Madness script was rewritten to accommodate this change; the film's writer, Michael Waldron, worked with Schaeffer to do this.[25][110]\n\nShakman and Schaeffer said the series was a \"love letter to the golden age of television\",[2][65] though it pays tribute to sitcoms from many eras of American television.[111] They chose to focus on family sitcoms over other types, such as workplace sitcoms, because the family aspect kept the series centered,[78] and because Wanda is searching for a family after losing her loved ones in the films.[101] Schaeffer and Shakman studied past sitcoms to learn their \"trappings and styles\",[2] while avoiding tropes from older sitcoms that would not be acceptable in a modern series.[78] Schaeffer, Shakman, and Feige spoke with Dick Van Dyke, the star of the eponymous 1960s sitcom, to learn about the making of that series.[2][65] Other sitcoms that inspired the series include I Love Lucy, My Three Sons, Father Knows Best, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, Bewitched,[66]: 45  The Brady Bunch, Family Ties,[27] Out of This World,[112] Malcolm in the Middle,[113] Modern Family, and The Office.[8] Meta references are made to Full House, which starred Olsen's older sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley.[66]: 45  Before they decided to focus on family sitcoms, an episode of the series was developed based on The Mary Tyler Moore Show that would have explored Wanda's work-life balance.[40] Olsen said the sitcom decade being explored in each episode, and the tropes from that decade that were highlighted, were chosen to connect to where the characters were in the larger story.[83] Each episode was meant to capture key elements of the chosen time period while showing the evolution of sitcoms over time.[102] For example, the first episode pays homage to The Dick Van Dyke Show and I Love Lucy from the 1950s and early 1960s, and was meant to have a general 1950s time period.[114] The changes between decades are explained in the series by changes within the fictional WandaVision program, which Wanda is initially doing subconsciously when something goes wrong in that reality. She later makes these changes consciously. Part of Schaeffer's initial pitch for the series was to link the decade changes to xenophobia from the couple's neighbors, as was seen in some of the characters' comic book appearances, with the neighbors becoming more aggressive each decade until they chase Wanda and Vision out of town. The relationship with the neighbors was ultimately portrayed in a more subtle way that Schaeffer felt was creepier, with elements of psychological horror.[25]\n\nThe fictional sitcom features fake commercials that are \"slightly nefarious\",[78] which Feige said were \"part of the truths of the show beginning to leak out\". He felt that new viewers would see these as strange versions of commercials from the different sitcom eras, while those well versed in the MCU would be able to see connections to past events.[11] Several commentators believed the commercials were analogies for traumatic events in Wanda's life,[115][116][117] which Schaeffer later acknowledged.[108] Shakman said the commercials were a thematic addition that presented Wanda's history while being open to interpretation,[44] and Schaeffer said they were tied to both Wanda's subconscious and the wider MCU in an open-ended way.[118] She added that they gave the series a structure and rhythm that was \"part of the fabric of the sitcom aesthetic\".[108] An early version of the commercials had \"more of an agenda and a function in the plot\",[118] with multiple commercials per episode also considered.[25] When Doctor Strange was planned to appear in the series, the commercials would have been his attempts to reach Wanda through the sitcom reality. He would have appeared in the Nexus pharmaceutical commercial in a \"blink-and-you-miss-it cameo\" as the pharmacist, before his full appearance in the finale.[25]\n\nWith the official announcement of the series in April 2019 came confirmation that Olsen and Bettany would reprise their respective roles of Wanda and Vision.[3] Bettany agreed to join the project after meeting with Feige and D'Esposito, who pitched an \"exciting and bonkers\" idea for his character's return.[65] Feige pitched the series to Olsen during negotiations for her to return in Endgame after Wanda's temporary death in Infinity War.[119] She was initially hesitant about the move to television,[65] wondering if it was a \"demotion\" from the films,[119] but was excited when she learned of Schaeffer's involvement as well as the comic book storylines that inspired the series.[65] Olsen came to see it as her \"wildest screen opportunity yet\".[119]\n\nTeyonah Parris was announced in the role of a grown-up Monica Rambeau in July 2019. Rambeau was previously portrayed as an eleven-year-old by Akira Akbar in Captain Marvel, which is set in 1995.[26] The character first appears in WandaVision as \"Geraldine\" inside the sitcom reality, and Schaeffer had been under the impression that Parris would be announced as playing \"Geraldine\" to keep the character reveal a surprise.[120] A month later, at Disney's biennial convention D23, Kat Dennings and Randall Park were set to reprise their respective MCU film roles as Darcy Lewis and Jimmy Woo.[32] Dennings had appeared in the films Thor (2011) and Thor: The Dark World (2013),[32] and was surprised and thrilled to be brought back to the MCU for WandaVision after so many years.[33] Park joined the series following a general meeting with Marvel to discuss Woo's MCU future following his introduction in Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018).[7] Schaeffer felt it was fun to feature Dennings and Park since both were veteran sitcom actors, respectively starring in 2 Broke Girls and Fresh Off the Boat.[9]\n\nAlso at D23, Kathryn Hahn was announced in the role of Agnes, Wanda and Vision's neighbor.[2][32] Hahn had been fascinated by the \"gasp of human magic\" in the MCU,[2] and had a general meeting with Marvel Studios since the studio was also interested in working with her. Shortly after, Marvel suggested Hahn for the role of Agnes to Schaeffer and Shakman, and they agreed that they should cast her. Several days after the general meeting, they contacted Hahn about the series and she said that she \"couldn't have dreamt a cooler part\", partially due to the sitcom elements.[121] The seventh episode reveals that \"Agnes\" is actually Agatha Harkness, a character in Marvel Comics.[20]\n\nThe official trailer revealed that Fred Melamed and Debra Jo Rupp would appear in the series,[85] portraying Todd and Sharon Davis. They appear as Wanda and Vision's neighbors, \"Mr. and Mrs. Hart\", within the fictional WandaVision program.[18][19][122] Rupp previously had a long-running role in the sitcom That '70s Show and was comfortable with WandaVision's sitcom style. She was asked to join the series by Shakman, who she had worked with at the Geffen Playhouse where Shakman is the artistic director.[123] Similarly, Shakman and Schaeffer offered Melamed the role without him auditioning, and he accepted the role because he was interested by the idea of the series.[124] WandaVision's fifth episode introduces Evan Peters as a \"recast\" Pietro Maximoff, Wanda's brother. Pietro was previously portrayed in the MCU by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, while Peters played a different version of the character named Peter Maximoff in 20th Century Fox's X-Men film series.[34] Schaeffer stated that it took a while to learn if Peters would be able to be a part of the series, and noted that the creatives did not have a secondary plan if they were not able to use him.[40] The character's \"real name\" is revealed to be Ralph Bohner in the finale.[36]\n\nEmma Caulfield Ford was cast in October 2019 as Sarah Proctor, who plays \"Dottie Jones\" in the WandaVision program, after being approached by Schaeffer to audition for the role; they previously worked together on the film Timer (2009).[46][125] Ford said she was cast in part to help attract genre fans who would recognize her from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and her involvement was also intended to be a red herring for the series' mysteries.[46] Asif Ali was revealed to be cast in October 2020,[126] as Abilash Tandon who plays Vision's co-worker \"Norm\",[19][41] as was Jolene Purdy, cast as Isabel Matsueda who plays Wanda and Vision's neighbor \"Beverly\".[41][50][127]\n\nWandaVision was the first production to have its digital intermediate (DI) work completed at Marvel Studios' new color department, run by Evan Jacobs. Shakman and cinematographer Jess Hall began working with that group before filming to determine the look of each sitcom period that the series was trying to replicate.[128] Shakman and Hall put together a collection of images from existing shows that influenced the framing, composition, and color of each sitcom setting,[129] and Hall created a specific color palette of 20 to 30 colors for each episode based on those reference images so he could control the \"visual integrity in color of each episode\", a process that he had previously used for the film Ghost in the Shell (2017). Hall worked with Josh Pines of Technicolor SA to create 23 different lookup tables for translating colors into the final look during the DI process, and worked with production designer Mark Worthington and costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo to ensure that the sets and costumes for each episode matched with his color palettes. Shakman said there was a progression of color between each episode of the series, and certain colors were carefully used such as red, which is important to both Wanda and Vision.[129]\n\nWorthington made sets for Wanda and Vision's house in each era, and intended for this to look like one house with the same basic layout that was built in the 1950s and then renovated each decade.[129][130] Changes were made to this as needed, such as adding the nursery for the third episode,[130] with objects inside the house also updated each decade along with the style of Wanda's red Buick.[102][129] For the S.W.O.R.D. sets outside of the sitcom reality, Worthington used NASA as an inspiration since S.W.O.R.D. is a space agency, but wanted to create the MCU version of that. He said there were some similarities to previous MCU sets for S.H.I.E.L.D., but the two agencies serve different functions so he wanted to differentiate them.[131] Worthington added that the S.W.O.R.D. base outside Westview was built on a field that was cold and exposed to the weather, while the soundstages for the sitcom sets were warm and dry, which helped with differentiating the ideal sitcom world from the reality outside.[130] Worthington and set decorator Kathy Orlando sourced period-appropriate household items and furniture from secondhand stores in Atlanta, Georgia.[132] Prop designer Russell Bobbit, who was the prop master for many MCU films,[131] also previously worked on the film Pleasantville (1998) which Shakman said the series had a \"spiritual connection\" to along with The Truman Show (1998).[98]\n\nRubeo said it was rare for a singular piece of media to progress through so many different decades without its characters aging,[67]: 6  and noted that the costumes of the various sitcoms being emulated by the series were not necessarily what was being worn at the time so she was replicating the looks of those series rather than the decades themselves.[133] Around 80 percent of the period costumes were made for the series to fit the actors, with the rest bought or rented from \"special [costume] houses\" and collections that knew of the fabrics used in the 1950s and 1960s and how garments were constructed then.[134] Olsen enjoyed exploring how women were viewed in society in each decade through Wanda's costumes.[11] Hair stylist Karen Bartek created 22 wigs for the series to represent the different eras from the 1950s to the 1980s,[135][136] which allowed these different eras to be filmed in one day without needing to re-style the actors' hair.[136] Rubeo added an element of teal to each of Dennings' costumes to match the color of the actress's eyes.[137]\n\nWanda gets a new superhero costume at the end of the series when she takes on the mantle of the Scarlet Witch.[138] This costume was designed by Andy Park of Marvel Studios' visual development team, and Rubeo worked with Ironhead Studios to create it.[139] She explained that the creatives wanted the costume to be more mature and \"weathered\" than Wanda's previous costumes, acknowledging what the character has gone through in the MCU so far. They also wanted it to be less revealing and not include a corset or tights,[134] as Olsen had previously expressed concern over her \"cleavage corset\" costume from the films and the fact that she was the only female superhero in the MCU with such a revealing outfit;[140] Olsen consulted on the design for the new costume. Shakman said the biggest element for discussion was the crown, which they initially thought should be smaller than it is in the comics. They ultimately decided to \"go big or go home\" with the crown,[105] which is depicted as forming from magical energy before Wanda uses her creation magic to turn it into a solid object.[138] Rubeo worked with shoemaking company Jitterbug Boy to create the boots for Wanda's costume.[141]\n\nTo hint that Agnes is really Agatha Harkness, Rubeo designed a medallion with three witches on it that the character wears as a brooch in each episode, except for when she is in aerobics gear in \"On a Very Special Episode...\" since Rubeo could not find a natural way to integrate the brooch with that outfit.[136][139] For Agatha's real witch costume, Rubeo wanted to add to the mystery of the character by giving her a dress made from 10 layers of fabric that are each a different color and texture.[139] Hahn worked with Rubeo on the costume design, and said it was intended to honor the character's appearance in the comic books but with a \"modern look on top of it\".[142]\n\nThe series' main title sequence was created by Perception, and starts with a \"please stand by\" visual in the style of the episode's sitcom era. This is followed by close-ups of footage from the episode on a television screen, which the camera then pushes through to show the RGB pixels that form television images. The pixels are rendered as hexagons, as a reference to Wanda's hex abilities and the informal name \"The Hex\" that is given to the sitcom reality. The pixels form various elements from the series including Wanda and Vision's house, the baby mobile from the third episode, and the Westview water tower,[143] which is reminiscent of the art style in \"House of M\".[144][145][146] The pixels are then disrupted by a single red pixel that represents Wanda's \"world falling apart around her\", before forming two wedding rings at the end of the sequence since the series is \"at its core a love story\".[143] Charles Pulliam-Moore at io9 felt the credits were \"undeniably Marvel in the big screen sense\", despite WandaVision otherwise attempting to embrace its streaming series format.[145]\n\nPerception also created many of the sitcom-style opening credits for the series,[143] with Shakman saying a lot of work went into creating these openings to be as authentic to each era as possible since the creatives \"knew that they were a key part of the storytelling\".[147] Additional work from Perception included graphics for the fake commercials, based on real commercials from the different sitcom eras; titles and smoke effects for the Agatha All Along sequence; onscreen locator cards; and two new transitions for the Marvel Studios logo (into black-and-white and a 4:3 aspect ratio for the first episode, and into purple smoke for Agatha's Salem backstory in \"Previously On\").[143]\n\nFilming began in early November 2019,[148] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[149] with Shakman directing,[70] and Hall serving as cinematographer.[111][150] The series was filmed under the working title Big Red.[149] The actors went through sitcom \"boot camp\" before filming, watching episodes of past sitcoms to help learn the tone and style of each era,[66]: 50  as well as the different approaches to comedy.[11] Dialect coach Courtney Young helped the actors speak like people from each era,[98] even noting the manners of each decade.[11] Bettany felt the approach to the series was clever since it had to make six hours of content on a budget similar to a two-and-a-half-hour MCU film. This included filming content from different episodes at the same time,[111] though Shakman did try to shoot chronologically to aid the actors with the progression through the sitcom eras.[10]: 34 \n\nThe first episode filmed for two days in black-and-white and in front of a live studio audience, to mimic sitcom filming in the 1950s.[2][111] A 4:3 aspect ratio is also used for the black-and-white scenes,[79] and Shakman enjoyed experimenting with the aspect ratio based on the narrative.[98] Scenes set outside the Hex used the 2.40:1 cinematic ratio of many MCU films.[151] Shakman wanted to ensure that the sitcom elements never felt like a parody and were as authentic as possible,[66]: 50  since they were a reality that Wanda created to escape from her grief and were real to her.[101] Hall used Arri Alexa 4K HDR cameras for the whole series,[151] to create a coherent look for the story,[152] and to make it easier to switch between different sitcom decades without needing to change the camera setup;[128] era-specific touches such as period-appropriate camera lenses, lighting, and live special effects were used to differentiate the period settings.[2] Hall used 47 different camera lenses for the seven time periods covered in WandaVision, many of which were modern lenses custom modified to keep characteristics of the period lenses.[67]: 6  The custom period-appropriate lenses were used on the first three episodes and the fifth, while Hall used the Ultra Panatar lenses that had been used on Infinity War and Endgame for all of the scenes set outside the Hex reality.[151] Tungsten lights were mainly used for the 1950s to the 1970s episodes since those were the lights of the era, with LED lighting used starting in the 2000s episodes which is when those began to be used for real sitcoms.[67]: 6  Shakman used lenses, lighting, and sound design inspired by The Twilight Zone to change the mood for moments when something goes wrong with Wanda's illusion.[153]\n\nLocation shooting took place in the Atlanta metropolitan area throughout December 2019 and February 2020.[154][155] A filming wrap party for the series occurred on March 1,[156] ahead of a planned four-week hiatus,[66]: 50 [157]: 1:07  but all production halted on March 14 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[158] Filming resumed in Los Angeles in September 2020 with rigorous COVID-19 safety protocols in place,[66]: 50  to complete required backlot and outdoor filming.[98][159] Olsen found it hard resuming production after being isolated during the shutdown, while Bettany disliked that the safety protocols meant the actors had to return to their trailers when not filming, which he felt removed much of the camaraderie between the cast and crew.[157]: 1:29–2:23  External filming for Westview took place on Blondie Street at the Warner Bros. Ranch in Burbank, California, where past sitcoms had also been filmed. Shakman felt the Blondie Street backlot had \"that weird sense of fakeness\" that no real-life street could replicate.[2] Filming for the Westview town square was originally planned for the Universal Studios Lot near Blondie Street, but this could not happen due to scheduling and the pandemic so filming for those scenes instead took place at the Golden Oak Ranch.[160][161] Production on the series wrapped by mid-November,[162] with Olsen shooting back-to-back with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.[163]\n\nWhen the production shut down due to the pandemic, Marvel took around a month to figure out the logistics of remote work. Post-production then continued on existing footage,[164] which informed Shakman of how to approach a few things differently once filming began again,[10]: 34  though the series was not creatively altered by this.[27] Post-production continued after filming resumed, and Shakman said working on every step of the process at once felt \"schizophrenic\".[10]: 34  Tim Roche, Zene Baker, and Nona Khodai served as editors for the series,[67]: 20 [165] and each brought different experience to the project: Baker previously edited Thor: Ragnarok; Khodai previously worked on the superhero series The Boys; and Roche came from a background editing comedy series with no visual effects. The editors agreed to treat the series like an MCU film since they knew Marvel Studios would not \"resort to [standard television series] money-saving tactics for a show like this\", and Baker said editing the series was no different from editing Ragnarok.[164]\n\nThe editors did not have formal meetings to discuss the series' tone, but did work together on issues. Roche felt the series' tone was most interesting when the sitcom and MCU elements were mixed together, such as when Vision discovers anomalies in Westview during \"All-New Halloween Spooktacular!\"[164] Aspect ratio shifts were created during post-production to give Shakman control over the lengths of the transitions,[151] with some of the earlier aspect ratio changes going through many variations to find the best length and style and have a bigger impression on the audience. Transitions in later episodes are sometimes just a straight cut from one ratio to another, relying more on music and sound to show the change. Some scenes were rearranged to avoid changing between aspect ratios too many times and distracting from the story.[164] One of the most discussed elements of editing was the laugh track,[7] and the creatives worked with sound engineer and laugh track historian Paul Iverson to explain how laugh tracks changed throughout time which informed the sound design.[98][166] Iverson provided the editing team with a selection of laughter track recordings used in sitcoms of the 1950s and through the eras.[166]\n\nPrevisualization company The Third Floor, Inc. added temporary effects to edited sequences as a guide for visual effects vendors. These were also sent to the DI team to finalize the coloring of shots before the visual effects were completed, which Baker said was unusual and done to save time but did not have much of an effect on the production's timeline. The editors all worked on the sitcom opening titles and fake commercials in their episodes, as well as the \"previously on WandaVision\" segments that begin each episode.[164] The latter have some differences from the episodes they are recapping, such as slightly different dialogue, which plays into Wanda's manipulation of reality.[167] Later episodes were not completed when the early ones began airing, so the editors were able to see fan theories about the series while they were still working on it. This made them question some of their decisions, but there was no time for this to have any creative effect on their work. Editing for the final episode was completed two weeks before it aired.[164]\n\nTara DeMarco served as the visual effects supervisor for WandaVision, with visual effects vendors for the series including Digital Domain, Framestore, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies (MARZ), RISE, Rodeo FX, SSVFX, The Yard VFX, and Zoic Studios.[168] The series has 3,010 visual effects shots,[169] more than the 2,496 in Avengers: Endgame,[170] though DeMarco noted that the series is longer than Endgame and that film had a lot of effects that were much more complex than many of those seen in WandaVision.[171] The creatives tried to keep the number of visual effects in each episode to a minimum until the 2000s-set episodes where it made sense to allow more prevalent visual effects due to the technology available at the time;[172] each episode has more visual effects shots than the previous one, building up to the \"big Marvel finale\" in the last episode.[173] For the first three episodes, contemporary visual effects were used to augment on-set practical effects and replicate other period-specific effects.[67]: 8 \n\nDeMarco took inspiration from the Scarlet Witch: Witches' Road comic book for the look of Wanda and Agatha's magic in the series.[174] Wanda's magic was created based on Olsen's on-set hand movements, with the visual effects team letting her create the movements that she wanted and then adding \"something tasteful with her hands that isn't distracting from her performance\".[175] The look of her magic initially matches the same red energy that was seen in the films, but becomes a darker, richer red when she starts using chaos magic to signify that it is more powerful.[171] This look was developed with Digital Domain, who primarily worked on the final episode and contributed 350 visual effect shots over 14 months.[176] Framestore, who worked on 99 visual effects shots for the series, developed the look of Agatha's magic, which is a purple version of Wanda's magic with a black, ink-like texture added to make it appear more evil.[177][171] Mr. X contributed 152 visual effects shots for the scenes in the final two episodes featuring a coven of witches.[178]\n\nDeMarco used Vision's introduction in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), which was primarily created by Lola VFX, as the definitive version of the character when approaching his visual effects for WandaVision. Close-ups of the character in Infinity War were also referenced. Bettany wore prosthetics over his ears to portray the character in the films, but these were replaced with CGI in post-production and were not actually needed. For the series, Bettany asked not to wear the prosthetics so he could hear better on set and be more comfortable. He instead wore a bald cap and face makeup to match Vision's color,[179] with the blue color used for Vision in the black-and-white episodes suggested by Lola VFX supervisor Trent Claus based on his knowledge of the makeup used for I Love Lucy.[180] The series' second visual effects supervisor, Sarah Elm, focused on Vision's effects and came to know what parts of Bettany's face needed to be kept and replaced to match the character's look in the films while retaining Bettany's performance. Multiple vendors worked on Vision for the series, and they were allowed to use their own methodologies for the character as long as the result was consistent. They generally used complex 3D and digital makeup techniques to create the character, with sections of Bettany's face replaced with CGI on a shot-by-shot basis; the actor's eyes, nose, and mouth were usually the only elements retained. Vision's skin needed to move to match with Bettany's performance, and sometimes specular highlights from the makeup were kept for the digital version, but it was not intended to look like actual skin with makeup on it and does not have pores or wrinkles. Digital contact lenses were applied over Bettany's eyes to create the \"complex digital radial graphics\" that Vision's eyes have,[179] though these were not added for the first three episodes to give Vision a more \"wholesome\" look during those sitcom periods.[181] The visual effects artists also had to manually fix the backgrounds around Vision's head since he has a narrower head than Bettany and has no ears.[179] MARZ, SSVFX, and Lola VFX were the primary vendors for Vision's face in the sitcom reality,[180] while Digital Domain created a full digital version of the character for the final episode which they shared with other vendors for use in earlier episodes. They also created a full model for White Vision.[179]\n\nRodeo FX spent nine months developing the visual effects for the Hex boundary and worked on 348 shots across most of the series' episodes.[179] DeMarco said the Hex was meant to look like it was made of the \"cathodic lines of old tube TVs and pixelization and a lot of cool RGB chromatic aberration effects\",[182] with photography that had \"the language of television\" also referenced for the design.[183] Rodeo tried using point cloud technology to create the effect, but this only worked well for dark backgrounds.[179] The boundary is initially clear and difficult to see, but turns red once Wanda emerges from the boundary in \"On a Very Special Episode...\" to reflect her anger and reinforce that it is a hard barrier.[182] Rodeo was also responsible for the sequence where Vision attempts to leave the Hex in \"All-New Halloween Spooktacular!\" and begins to disintegrate, and the scene where Rambeau enters the Hex and gains superpowers in \"Breaking the Fourth Wall\".[179] ILM handled the creation of the Hex and Vision in \"Previously On\", and also the effect of them disappearing in \"The Series Finale\".[172] Cantina Creative designed and animated graphics for different monitors and devices such as S.W.O.R.D.'s holographic table.[184] A number of final visual effects were reportedly added to the series after it had premiered.[185]\n\nIn January 2020, Christophe Beck announced that he would compose the score for the series, after previously scoring Ant-Man (2015) and Ant-Man and the Wasp.[186] He paid homage to the sitcoms in each time period through his instrumentation, compositional style, and period-specific recording and mixing techniques. Earlier episodes feature small orchestral ensembles, with later episodes having more of a rock-pop style, and the music becoming more pervasive as the series progresses.[67]: 9  He had hoped to match the spotting of each sitcom era as well, but found that this would not always work due to modern audiences expecting more music than older sitcoms would have included.[187] Beck's frequent collaborator Michael Paraskevas composed additional music, as did Alex Kovacs,[188] with Kovacs hired due to his experience with older orchestration techniques and jazz music which Beck found helpful when writing for the series' early episodes. Beck was more comfortable once the episodes required music inspired by the 1980s and 1990s.[187] To connect the music for the different sitcom eras, as well as the more traditional music for outside the sitcom reality, he composed several themes that are used in the different styles, which was possible since he knew where the series and characters were going from the beginning.[67]: 9 [187] He was most excited for the opportunity to write a definitive theme for Wanda that is heard during the series' end credits, which he hoped other composers would reprise for the character's future MCU appearances. Beck also wrote a love theme for Wanda and Vision that he said would convey feelings of love, tragedy, and sadness, which he compared to the romance music he composed for the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.[187]\n\nIn December 2020, Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez were announced to have written theme songs for some of the series' episodes.[189][190] They were approached for the series in mid-2019 by Shakman, who was friends with Lopez at college, and they had previously worked with Beck on the music for Disney's Frozen franchise.[189][191] To help sell the series to the couple, Shakman referenced the Adult Swim short Too Many Cooks, which the couple were aware of and called one of their favorite sketches. The couple were inspired by the theme songs from past sitcoms as well as the music from James Bond films, composer Burt Bacharach, and jazz pianist and composer Dave Brubeck.[191] To tie their themes together, Lopez and Anderson-Lopez created a four-note motif that worked in each of the theme song styles.[192] The motif begins with an octave, followed by a tritone, which is also known as \"the devil's interval\"; this was their way of saying musically that the series was a \"big bright-colored swing while also being really unsettling\".[193] Lopez described the motif as \"kind of like the WandaVision call-out, easily identifiable in some way in each song\" that was incorporated in different ways each time.[67]: 9 [192] The pair used their knowledge of sitcoms from watching them as they grew up, and found the 1990s to be the most challenging era to write a theme song for due to them both being at college during that decade when they did not have a television,[194] while the 1980s was their favorite. Anderson-Lopez added that it was challenging to ensure the themes were not \"parodying any one show\" but \"would evoke all of the iconic songs from an entire decade and be their own thing\". She also felt it was their job with the theme songs to establish the tone, place, and time of the episodes in lieu of title cards providing such information.[192] The couple sang on many of the theme songs, something they normally do not do for the final versions of their songs, which Anderson-Lopez attributed in part to the pandemic. They were joined by a group of backup singers for some of the songs.[192][194]\n\nBeck chose to align the style and instrumentation of some of the episodes' music to the theme songs of those episodes, and tried to include motifs from the songs in the background score wherever possible.[195] His music was recorded with a 75-player orchestra at Synchron Stage in Vienna,[196][197] and he completed work on the series in February 2021.[187] Soundtrack albums for each episode, including Beck's score and the theme songs by Lopez and Anderson-Lopez, were released digitally by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records from January 22 to March 12, 2021, one week after each episode premiered.[198][199][200] One of the theme songs, \"Agatha All Along\", went viral after appearing in \"Breaking the Fourth Wall\",[201] peaking at number one on iTunes' Soundtrack chart, reaching fifth on iTunes' Top 100 singles chart,[202] and debuted on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart at number 36.[203] It also earned the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[204][205]\n\nDisney's marketing team conceived its campaign for the series roughly a year-and-a-half before its release.[206] At the 2019 D23, Olsen confirmed that the series would mix elements of classic sitcoms with the MCU, which was shown in a teaser that combined footage of Wanda and Vision from previous MCU films with images from old sitcoms The Dick Van Dyke Show and Father Knows Best.[7][70] The series was promoted as part of Expanding the Universe, a Marvel Studios special that debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019.[63] In December, Feige debuted the first image from the series at Comic Con Experience. Vinnie Mancuso of Collider said it was \"very interesting\", highlighting the \"old-school black and white\" coloring.[207] A commercial for the series and fellow Marvel Studios Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki was shown during Super Bowl LIV.[208] Inverse's Dais Johnston found visual references to past sitcoms in the commercial, including The Dick Van Dyke Show, Leave It to Beaver, Bewitched, The Brady Bunch, Roseanne, and Full House. They thought the series would be a \"must-see\" for Marvel fans as well as \"anyone looking for a hit of nostalgia: the era-spanning framework means anyone can relive the shows of their childhood\".[209] Julia Alexander of The Verge said the footage \"wasn't much\" but offered \"enough glimpses to tease fans\".[210] Haleigh Foutch at Collider felt of all the Super Bowl commercials, Marvel's \"stole the whole show\". She was most excited by the \"utterly strange and unpredictable looking\" WandaVision footage.[211]\n\nThe series' official trailer was released on September 20, 2020, during the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards.[212] The trailer received 55.7 million online views within 24 hours, including 36.1 million on YouTube, 4.9 million on Facebook, and 10.1 million on Instagram, which was believed to be the highest number ever for a streaming television series trailer. WandaVision also had over 302,600 social mentions, trending on Twitter immediately after a teaser aired during the Emmy Awards ahead of the full trailer's release, and ultimately trending fourth on Twitter. The trailer was the number two trending video on YouTube.[213] Ethan Anderton from /Film said the footage in the trailer looked like \"one of the most trippy Marvel projects to date\". He also noted more lighthearted aspects of the trailer such as Vision wearing a Halloween costume of the character's comic book design.[214] Matt Patches at Polygon called the trailer \"a hoot, full of bright colors and odd behavior\", adding that it still left much of the series a mystery.[215] Comic Book Resources' Noah Dominguez said the trailer \"offers quite a bit in terms of content\" with \"a vivid look at some of the visual tricks on display\".[216] Charles Pulliam-Moore of io9 called the trailer's use of \"Twilight Time\" by The Platters \"the most haunting\" of all of its strange features, and felt the trailer's editing created \"the effect of rapidly flipping through television channels in search of something good to watch\".[85] The Hollywood Reporter's Richard Newby described the trailer as \"jam-packed with information\" and felt that it \"gives fans quite a lot to look forward to, as well as some mysteries to ponder over leading up to the premiere\".[86] After actors from past Spider-Man films were revealed to be appearing in Spider-Man: No Way Home, Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter saw the series' official trailer \"in a new light\", suggesting the different versions of Wanda and Vision that appear in the series were because of Wanda \"breaking down walls between different realities\", which could set up Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Spider-Man: No Way Home.[217]\n\nIn early December, six posters for the series were released daily, each depicting a decade from the 1950s through the 2000s. Pulliam-Moore noted that with each new poster, \"different elements shift and morph, both reflecting the passage of time and WandaVision's plot developments\".[218] The release of the posters was followed by a new trailer that debuted at Disney's Investors Day presentation. Anderton noted for /Film that the trailer featured more non-sitcom-inspired footage than previously seen, with \"a lot to soak in\".[219] Chaim Gartenberg at The Verge called the new trailer \"mind-bending\",[220] while Tom Reimann of Collider described it as \"delightfully weird\" and drew comparisons to the \"House of M\" comic book storyline.[221] Tony Sokol at Den of Geek highlighted the trailer's use of The Monkees' song \"Daydream Believer\", believing the title and lyrics reflected Wanda's mental state well even though the music becomes \"barely recognizable under increasing layers of psychedelic weirdness\".[222] The trailer received 9 million views on YouTube.[206] The first two episodes of the series Marvel Studios: Legends, released on January 8, 2021, explore Wanda and Vision using footage from their MCU film appearances.[223]\n\nIncluding the aforementioned trailers, the series' marketing campaign across outdoor, digital, television, and magazine advertisements yielded 2.14 billion impressions. Analytics firm RelishMix determined the social reach for the series within its \"social media universe\" was 263,000, which was \"lightyears ahead of most streaming shows\". The various trailers, ads, and interviews posted to YouTube garnered the most awareness and engagement for WandaVision, with RelishMix noting that content posted to Marvel, Disney, and Disney+'s official channels was then reposted on fan channels. Leading up to the premiere, advertisements, \"special-look stunt interstitials, co-branded takeovers, on-air graphic integrations, in-show integrations, and custom talent content\" appeared on the various channels and assets of Walt Disney Television, ESPN, and Hulu, while billboards were seen in major cities such as New York and Los Angeles. Talent and influencers were sent a \"TV-dinner box that had a custom TV tray, utensil set, coasters, drinking glasses, and a [custom] journal designed to look like a vintage TV Guide\". A \"never-before-done 'reality bending' grid that updates on its own\" was created for the series' Instagram account,[206] with Disney's marketing team uploading each post in a specific order while the account was private and then archiving them. Once the account became public, the different posts were un-archived and re-archived to show a different grid of images for each episode.[224] Custom emojis on Twitter updated each week as WandaVision progressed through the decades.[206]\n\nIn January 2021, Marvel announced their \"Marvel Must Haves\" program, which revealed new toys, games, books, apparel, home decor, and other merchandise related to each episode of WandaVision each Monday from January 18 to March 8, 2021.[225][226] Additional \"Must Haves\" merchandise was revealed on May 10, 2021.[227] From late February 2021 until the series concluded in early March, Marvel partnered with chef Justin Warner to release recipes for food featured in, or inspired by, each episode.[228][229] In June 2021, Hyundai Motor Company released a commercial featuring Olsen as Wanda promoting WandaVision and the Hyundai Tucson. The commercial was produced by Marvel alongside similar commercials for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki, and What If...?, and was meant to tell an \"in-world\" story set within the narrative of the series.[230]\n\nIn July 2023, Manta Lab announced limited edition SteelBooks for the series with various accessories such as postcards, character cards, and stickers. DVD or Blu-ray discs were not included with the SteelBooks,[231][232] as it was not an official home media release from Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment.[233]\n\nWandaVision premiered on Disney+ on January 15, 2021, with its first two episodes.[234] The other seven episodes were released weekly until March 5.[74][234] Marvel Studios originally planned to release the first three episodes at once, but decided against this because the final episode would not have been completed in time for that release schedule.[96] They also considered releasing the entire series at once, but chose weekly releases after seeing the success that the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian had with that approach. The episodes were subsequently structured with the weekly release in mind, with Feige explaining that they wanted viewers to try to \"guess what happens next, to have a week speculating or rewatching and building that anticipation\". He felt binge-watching the series after all the episodes were released would be an \"equally fun experience\".[235]\n\nAccording to Shakman, the series was able to premiere so soon after filming ended because post-production work had already begun during the series' COVID-19 production shutdown.[10]: 34  Schaeffer felt the series was \"suited to [being released during] this moment in time\", amidst the pandemic, because it is a \"reflection of a lot of the anxiety that we're feeling, and a lot of the pathos and chaos of [2020], so it feels very right to me\".[10]: 35  Esquire's Matt Miller felt WandaVision had incredible timing with its release since much of the audience was \"collectively escaping to nostalgia to cope with a pandemic and the general chaos of the real world\". He also felt WandaVision was \"commenting on the very nature and purpose of consuming comic book entertainment\".[236] The series was originally set for release in early 2021,[237] before being moved forward to a December 2020 release in February 2020.[238] It was then moved back to the early 2021 slot in November 2020.[239] It is the first series in, and the start of, Phase Four of the MCU.[27][240]\n\nWandaVision was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray and Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on November 28, 2023, with SteelBook packaging and concept art cards.[241][242] Bonus features include \"Through the Eras\" with the cast and crew,[242] along with a look at the spin-off series Agatha All Along;[243] deleted scenes; a gag reel; and the Marvel Studios: Assembled documentary special \"The Making of WandaVision\".[242]\n\nWandaVision was Disney+'s most-watched series premiere on its opening weekend, ahead of the second season of The Mandalorian, until Disney+ announced that it had been surpassed by the series premiere of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier in March 2021.[244] When compared to other streaming series in each week of its release, WandaVision did not have the highest number of minutes viewed using Nielsen Media Research's measurements. Scott Mendelson of Forbes felt that this could be attributed to WandaVision's weekly release schedule, and opined that Disney accepted this in exchange for the continued discussions and coverage that the weekly release had given to event series such as Game of Thrones and The Mandalorian.[245] According to analytics provider TVision, who count U.S. viewers on connected televisions who have watched at least two minutes within a session of watching content for at least five minutes, WandaVision was the most viewed title of January 2021 across all major U.S. streaming and advertising video on demand services. The series had an 8,127 indexed audience size, which was 81 times more views than the average series measured by the service.[246]\n\nPercentage of positive critics' reviews tracked by the website Rotten Tomatoes[247]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 91% approval rating with an average rating of 7.80/10, based on 414 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Part loving homage to TV history, part off-kilter mystery, WandaVision is a wonderfully weird and strikingly bold step into the small screen for the MCU—and a perfect showcase for Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany.\"[247] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 77 out of 100 based on 43 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[248]\n\nThe first three episodes were given to critics to review the series ahead of its premiere, and TVLine's Rebecca Iannucci gave them an \"A\", praising WandaVision for deviating from the expectations of an MCU story.[249] Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter said it was \"creatively courageous\" for an action-focused franchise to make a \"postmodern exploration of sitcom conventions\" that its core fans may not enjoy.[23] Shirley Li at The Atlantic praised the series' small stakes and focus on Wanda's grief and trauma, giving the character a chance to process loss in a way that superhero films generally do not allow.[250] Caroline Framke, writing for Variety, was more critical of the series, believing it would be too confusing for casual fans and stating that it was not as good at being a sitcom as the series it was copying. She preferred when it focused on its underlying mysteries.[45] Dominic Patten of Deadline Hollywood was also critical, describing it as a \"baby boomer punchline in search of a joke\" and believing that Marvel Television's Netflix series and ABC's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. were better.[251]\n\nMany critics praised the recreation of sitcom styles and tropes.[249][250][252][253][254] Iannucci felt WandaVision was able to perfectly encapsulate the sitcoms it was replicating, and this helped make its mystery elements compelling during the first three episodes.[249] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times described the series as a \"painstakingly crafted, impressively spot-on tribute to the evolution of the American sitcom\", and gave it 3.5 stars out of 4,[252] while Melanie McFarland at Salon said the creative team had recreated the sitcoms with \"admirable precision\", and especially praised Shakman's work. She did question whether the unique style of the first three episodes would be maintained until the end of the series, but felt it was going to be worth watching it all either way.[253] Li and Slant Magazine's Niv M. Sultan both felt it was likely that the series would move towards a more traditional MCU format, but still praised the sitcom elements in the early episodes.[250][254] Roxana Hadadi at RogerEbert.com was less positive about the sitcom elements and the way they had \"sidelined\" Wanda and Vision. Hadadi questioned what role the sitcom recreations played in the story and character development, which was not clear in the first three episodes.[255] Michael Phillips, writing for the Chicago Tribune, was critical of the sitcom tropes themselves, such as \"canned and deadly\" laugh tracks, as well as the episodes' pacing,[256] though he went on to enjoy episodes four through seven more because he felt those sitcom elements were a better fit for the cast.[257]\n\nReviewing the full series for Polygon, Joshua Rivera criticized its ending for setting up future MCU projects rather than resolving its own story. He said the series' biggest success was not being interested in heroism or justifying Wanda's actions, but felt it had undermined its exploration of Wanda's grief by not exploring Rambeau's grief as well.[258] Rolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall and Entertainment Weekly's Chancellor Agard also expressed concern with the series' focus on setting up other MCU stories in its finale, but both felt that this did not take away from the series' success.[36][259] Agard enjoyed the series' lower-stakes goals of exploring grief and developing Wanda into a fully fleshed-out character in a way that previous MCU films had never done. He gave the full series a \"B+\".[259] Sepinwall praised the series for its use of \"narrative form to serve emotional function\" and expressed hope that Marvel Studios would continue to experiment with its MCU projects in a similar way.[36] Zaki Hasan at the San Francisco Chronicle felt WandaVision worked as both an installment in the MCU franchise and also as an \"introspective tale\", with an ending that was \"honest with its audience [and] true to itself\". He also felt that it was a story suited to serialized television, with the central mysteries giving way to \"meditations on love and loss\" across its episodes.[260] Matt Purslow from IGN gave the series an 8 out of 10 and praised it as a bold change for the MCU that was unlike any other mainstream television series. He felt the series' biggest flaw was the fact that its emotional stakes were kept a mystery for so long, but with hindsight he praised the structure of the series' episodes which had no formula and made \"each installment feel like a genuinely new adventure\".[76]\n\nThe performances of Olsen, Bettany, Hahn, and Parris were all praised by critics,[23][76][249][253][260] and the roles of Dennings and Park as comic relief were also appreciated.[257] Sam Barsanti of The A.V. Club said the series' greatest strength was the way it took established MCU characters and put them into a new kind of story for the franchise.[261] Olsen received particular praise, with Iannucci describing the series as an opportunity for the actress to showcase her acting skills,[249] and Feinberg calling it a better \"acting vehicle\" than Olsen's roles in the MCU films.[23] Framke praised the way Olsen balanced her existing portrayal of Wanda with the series' sitcom influences, and felt the series would not work without a \"nuanced actor like Olsen tethering it to some kind of reality\".[45] Purslow highlighted Olsen's \"chameleon-like ability\" to replicate the performances of actresses from the different sitcom eras while also providing the required \"heft\" for the character's more dramatic scenes.[76] Discussing the series for The Ringer, Alison Herman praised it for focusing on Olsen as Wanda and exploring themes of grief, motherhood, and the history of gender in media without being marketed as a female-focused superhero series. She described WandaVision as a \"piece of mass entertainment that's centered on women and adds depth as a result, but doesn't demand up front to be read as such\".[262]\n\nAfter the first three episodes, Iannucci questioned if the series would have been better suited releasing its episodes all at once as opposed to weekly.[249] William Hughes of The A.V. Club agreed, believing that the slowly-revealed \"mystery-box\" format was \"in direct opposition to the MCU ethos, which can tolerate a mystery for exactly as long as it takes its antsiest audience member to start to squirm. To withhold information—to withhold anything—is counter to what turned these films into a pop culture institution, and that necessity to provide gives WandaVision the sense of a show being pulled in even more directions than its already bifurcated premise might suggest.\" Hughes also felt that the less subtle mystery clues, such as changes in cinematography style, were distracting from the \"legitimately wonderful work [that the series'] leads are doing in their homage to classic comedy styles\".[263] Miles Surrey, writing for The Ringer, disagreed with Hughes, thinking the series understood the expectations of the audience by explaining the mysteries that the audience was likely already deducing in the fourth episode. Surrey added that WandaVision \"isn't really trying to hide what it's about, but that works to the show's advantage. The series is getting better—and way creepier—the more it draws the curtain... [paving] the way for Marvel to make a concerted effort to dabble with horror; at least by the MCU's standards.\"[264]\n\nThe series' mystery elements and use of red herrings led to many theories that were widely discussed.[265][266][267] These red herrings included the character \"Dottie\",[15][46] and elements of the sets and visual effects.[268] Recurring imagery such as hexagons was also identified and analyzed.[269][270] The casting of Peters as \"Pietro Maximoff\" was particularly discussed, with many fans believing that his role was related to the multiverse and indicated a crossover with the X-Men film series;[271] speculation also arose that additional members of the X-Men would appear in the series.[102][83][272] The fact that this was not the case led Carlos Morales of IGN to describe the casting as unnecessary and a \"hollow move, because it simultaneously dilutes what should be an important character beat into an 'I know him!' cameo, while also opening up a well of speculation that doesn't really go anywhere.\"[273] Schaeffer defended the casting, explaining that it was not meant to feel like a prank and instead was done as part of the series' larger exploration of Wanda's grief. She added that using another actor was \"not going to have the same thrill, and craziness, and questions, and be as disorienting\".[38] Screen Rant's Daniel Gillespie agreed, and called the casting a smart move that helped spark discussion of the series which might not have happened with another actor.[274] Adam B. Vary from Variety felt the casting was a good joke, but pointed out that it only worked if the viewer knew Peters had previously portrayed Peter Maximoff in the X-Men films. This is where Vary felt the series \"got itself into some trouble\" since \"all kinds of multiverse shenanigans seemed to be at play, and the serious (and seriously online) fandom took that and sprinted with it\".[271]\n\nOther theories that fans and commentators speculated about include an aerospace engineer mentioned by Rambeau turning out to be an existing Marvel Comics character such as Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four;[102][265][272] Benedict Cumberbatch reprising his role as Stephen Strange;[272] and the Marvel Comics character Mephisto being the series' secret villain.[102][120][269][275] These theories did not pan out, though it was later revealed that there were early plans for Cumberbatch to appear in the series.[25][102] Schaeffer felt the series never presented the expectations that any of this speculation would be part of the series, and believed that it delivered on the expectations and promises it did make.[120] Collider's Carly Lane agreed with this sentiment, believing the series never strayed from the story it set out to tell, adding that WandaVision's weekly release allowed viewers to create \"expectation over what they hoped the show would satisfy, rather than focusing on what it actually gave us\". Lane concluded that there was nothing inherently wrong with fan theories, but equating a rewarding experience to how many theories come true \"overlooks all of the places where the story has already succeeded\".[266]\n\nTrauma therapist Erin Qualey felt WandaVision was a positive representation of complex mental health issues in media, stating the exploration of Wanda's grief in the series made her \"quickly become one of the most relatable characters on television\" in the COVID-19 era, in which many were living with similar traumas. Qualey added, \"By exploring how the process of admitting weakness can become an inherent strength, Wanda's story marks a refreshing, if temporary, departure from the usual comic book formula\", and enjoyed that the series was exploring a person's internal struggles that people could relate to, rather than relying on a catastrophic event or fighting villains for spectacle. Speaking to a moment in the eighth episode when Vision likens grief to love persevering, Qualey said it was fantastic that Marvel \"took an earnest pause to convey this sentiment\".[276]\n\nCandace Davison of PureWow initially dismissed the series and its replication of sitcom tropes as a \"cheesy superhero show\", but ultimately found it to be a \"powerful allegory for living through loss and extreme trauma, and in some ways, it mirrors how we're all coping with [COVID-19] pandemic life\". Davison had seen the series as a \"gimmicky play on shows from different decades\", but by its end she was discussing how Wanda's sitcom reality was a way of coping with her trauma. She compared this to the comedy series The Office being the most-streamed series of 2020 when audiences were looking for comfort and escapism.[277] Gayle Sequeira at Film Companion also discussed how the sitcom nostalgia was not just a gimmick, noting that the series shows Wanda's parents using sitcoms as a coping mechanism for their family in war-torn Sokovia, and Wanda then uses the same strategy herself during traumatic moments of her adult life. Sequeira also discussed how the series examines this coping mechanism, stating, \"The show does champion entertainment as a safe and welcoming space for those looking for an escape, but it also acts as a cautionary tale for those who employ it as an unhealthy coping mechanism... The show's release during a global pandemic, a time when people are turning to entertainment as a means of coping more than ever, drives home the point.\"[278]\n\nAt io9, Charles Pulliam-Moore called the series a \"quirky character study\" for Vision since the series has allowed him to \"inhabit his identities as a hero, a goofball, and a loving husband\" wrapped in the construct of an American sitcom. Pulliam-Moore was particularly fascinated by Vision becoming a father, given he \"toils at a job he doesn't understand, checks when things go bump in the night, and does his best to take care of chores around the house before [Wanda] can get to them with her magic\", all to ensure Wanda stays happy in their charade. He also felt the series was being purposeful with its exploration of romance and intimacy, which he felt was \"largely missing\" from superhero films.[279]\n\nWandaVision was nominated for eight Primetime Emmy Awards and fifteen Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards (winning three Creative Arts Emmys),[204][280] as well as one American Film Institute Award (won),[281] one Annie Award,[282] one Art Directors Guild Award (won),[283] four Critics' Choice Television Awards,[284] one Directors Guild of America Award,[285] two Golden Globe Awards,[286] one Grammy Award,[287] one Hugo Award,[288] one Nebula Award (won),[289] four People's Choice Awards,[290] one Producers Guild of America Award,[291] four TCA Awards,[292] three Visual Effects Society Awards,[293] and one Writers Guild of America Award, among others.[294]\n\nBettany and Hahn were widely considered to be the front-runners to win Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie, respectively, at the Emmys, with their losses deemed a surprise, along with the series only receiving wins at the Creative Arts Emmys.[295][296][297][298] The series is one of 117 television series that received the ReFrame Stamp for the years 2020 to 2021. The stamp is awarded by the gender equity coalition ReFrame as a \"mark of distinction for projects that ... hire female-identifying people in four out of eight critical areas of production\" to show progress in gender-balanced television production.[299]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced.[300] The series' first special, \"The Making of WandaVision\", explores the making of the series, with Schaeffer, Shakman, Olsen, Bettany, Rupp, Hahn, Parris, Park, Dennings, Peters, and others discussing the classic sitcoms that inspired the series, how the crew emulated the production processes of early sitcoms, and the experience of filming in front of a live studio audience. The special was released on Disney+ on March 12, 2021,[301] and will be included as part of the series' home media release on November 28, 2023.[242]\n\nIn January 2021, Schaeffer said she was unable to talk about any potential plans for a second season, but said the series would feel complete.[302] Shakman said there were no plans for a second season and one would only be made if a specific story came about that would warrant it.[303] In June 2021, Olsen said WandaVision was a limited series.[104]\n\nFeige did not rule out a second season, but said one was not planned and WandaVision's story would instead be continued in the film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,[304] among other places:[305] Parris reprised her role as Rambeau in the film The Marvels (2023), the sequel to Captain Marvel,[306] which was co-written by WandaVision writer Megan McDonnell.[92][307]\n\nWandaVision is intended to serve as the start of a trilogy of series that includes Agatha All Along and Vision Quest.[308]\n\nBy October 2021, a \"dark comedy\" spin-off series was in development with Hahn returning to reprise her role as Agatha Harkness and Schaeffer returning as writer and executive producer.[309] Schaeffer, who serves as showrunner,[310] also directed episodes of the series, along with Gandja Monteiro and Rachel Goldberg.[311] Hahn's involvement was part of a larger deal with Marvel Studios to reprise her role in series and films.[312] Marvel Studios officially announced the series in November 2021.[313] Other actors reprising their WandaVision roles include Ford,[314] Rupp,[315] Payton, Lengel, Ali, Glick, Forbes,[311] and Peters,[316] starring alongside Joe Locke, Sasheer Zamata, Ali Ahn, Maria Dizzia, Paul Adelstein, Miles Gutierrez-Riley, Okwui Okpokwasili, Patti LuPone, and Aubrey Plaza.[310] Rupp described the series as the second season of WandaVision.[317] Agatha All Along premiered in September 2024.[318]\n\nBy October 2022, a second spin-off series centered on Bettany's Vision was in development, titled Vision Quest, with Bettany starring and Schaeffer set as head writer.[319][320] Schaeffer was no longer developing Vision Quest by May 2024, due to her focus on Agatha All Along, and Marvel Studios hired Terry Matalas to redevelop the series and serve as its showrunner; Bettany was confirmed to still be reprising his role.[321] Marvel still referred to the series as Vision Quest,[322][323] though this was reported to not be its final title.[308] James Spader reprises his role as Ultron from Avengers: Age of Ultron.[308] The series is scheduled to premiere in 2026.[321]\n"

        "content": "\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier[a] is an American television miniseries created by Malcolm Spellman for the streaming service Disney+, based on Marvel Comics featuring the characters Sam Wilson / Falcon and Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier. It is the second television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) produced by Marvel Studios, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise, and is set six months after Sam Wilson was handed the mantle of Captain America in the film Avengers: Endgame (2019). Wilson teams up with Bucky Barnes to stop anti-patriots who believe the world was better during the Blip. Spellman served as head writer for the series, which was directed by Kari Skogland.\n\nSebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie reprise their respective roles as Barnes and Wilson from the film series, with Wyatt Russell, Erin Kellyman, Danny Ramirez, Georges St-Pierre, Adepero Oduye, Don Cheadle, Daniel Brühl, Emily VanCamp, Florence Kasumba, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus also starring. By September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for Disney+ centered on supporting characters from the MCU films, such as Wilson and Barnes. Spellman was hired in October and chose to focus on the racial and political issues raised by Wilson, a Black man, being handed Captain America's shield at the end of Endgame. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was announced in April 2019, when Stan and Mackie were confirmed to be starring. Skogland was hired to direct the next month. Filming began in October 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia, before moving to the Czech Republic in March 2020. Production was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it resumed in Atlanta in September before wrapping in the Czech Republic in October.\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier premiered on March 19, 2021, and ran for six episodes until April 23. It is part of Phase Four of the MCU. The series received positive reviews, with critics highlighting the actors' chemistry and the series' social commentary but criticizing its pacing. It received several accolades, including five Primetime Emmy Award nominations. A feature film, Captain America: Brave New World (2025), continues Wilson's story from the series.\n\nSix months after being handed the mantle of Captain America at the end of Avengers: Endgame (2019),[3] Sam Wilson teams up with Bucky Barnes on a global mission to stop an anti-patriotism group, the Flag Smashers, who are enhanced with a recreation of the Super Soldier Serum and believe the world was better during the Blip.[4]\n\nRecurring members of the Flag Smashers include Desmond Chiam as Dovich, Dani Deetté as Gigi, Indya Bussey as DeeDee,[39] Renes Rivera as Lennox,[40] Tyler Dean Flores as Diego,[41] and Noah Mills as Nico.[39] Also recurring are Amy Aquino as Christina Raynor, Barnes's therapist;[42] Chase River McGee and Aaron Haynes as Sam Wilson's nephews Cass and AJ;[43] Alphie Hyorth as a U.S. senator who is the U.S. representative on the Global Repatriation Council (GRC);[44] Clé Bennett as Lemar Hoskins / Battlestar, a sergeant major in the U.S. Army and Walker's Captain America strike force partner;[45][15][14] Carl Lumbly as Isaiah Bradley, an African-American Korean War veteran and super soldier who was imprisoned and experimented on for 30 years; Elijah Richardson as Isaiah's grandson Eli Bradley;[46] and Gabrielle Byndloss as Olivia Walker, John's wife.[45]\n\nAdditional guest stars include Ken Takemoto as Yori Nakajima, the father of one of the Winter Soldier's victims;[44] Miki Ishikawa as Leah, a waitress who has a date with Barnes;[21] Ness Bautista as Matias, a member of the Flag Smashers;[45] Neal Kodinsky as Rudy, a supporter of the Flag Smashers;[47] Veronica Falcón as Donya Madani, Morgenthau's adoptive mother;[48] Olli Haaskivi as Wilfred Nagel, the scientist who recreated the Super Soldier Serum;[47] and Nicholas Pryor as Oeznik, Zemo's butler.[44] Janeshia Adams-Ginyard and Zola Williams portray Nomble and Yama, respectively, both members of the Dora Milaje.[49] Other GRC members include Salem Murphy as Lacont, the representative from India; and Jane Rumbaua as Ayla Perez, the representative from the Philippines.[50][44] Good Morning America correspondent Sara Haines makes a cameo appearance as herself.[14]\n\nBy September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for its parent company Disney's streaming service, Disney+, to be centered on supporting characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films who had not starred in their own films. The actors who portrayed the characters in the films were expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each and have a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, which produced previous television series in the MCU. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,[51] focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.[52]\n\nMalcolm Spellman was one of several writers asked to pitch a series focusing on Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson / Falcon and Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier.[53] Feige believed the MCU films had not explored these two characters enough, and Marvel Studios especially wanted to explore the pair more after seeing the audience reaction to their \"fun dynamic\" in the MCU films Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America: Civil War (2016).[6]: 1  Mackie and Stan had both previously expressed interest in starring in an MCU spin-off film together, with Stan comparing the idea to buddy comedy films like Midnight Run (1988) and 48 Hrs. (1982).[54] It was Marvel Studios' intention for the series to use the \"buddy two-hander\" format like those films.[7] Each writer developed their pitch for the series with a Marvel Studios executive; Spellman worked with Nate Moore, and his pitch focused on race and identity.[53] He gave 48 Hrs., The Defiant Ones (1958), Lethal Weapon (1987), and Rush Hour (1998) as examples of buddy films that dealt with issues of race and which he wanted to model the series after.[7] Spellman had a migraine when he pitched his take to Feige, and he felt that the presentation did not go well. Moore advocated for Spellman and his approach, which the writer felt was because Moore agreed that focusing on race was the right direction for the series.[53] Spellman was hired to write the limited series by the end of October 2018.[52][55] Feige felt Spellman was the right person for the job because he understood what was needed to make the series fun and action-packed, while also being a Black male television writer which gave him the point of view that was needed to tell the type of story about Wilson that Marvel Studios wanted to tell.[16]\n\nThe series was announced in April 2019 as The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.[5] This was the first television series to be developed by Marvel Studios, and Spellman said it was \"a bit of a learning curve\" for the studio who approached it as a six-hour film.[56] Kari Skogland was hired the next month to direct all six episodes,[9] which are around 45–55 minutes each,[7] with budgets reported to be as much as $25 million.[1] Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Moore, Skogland, and Spellman executive produced the series,[6]: 15  which is retitled Captain America and the Winter Soldier in the sixth episode's credits.[2]\n\nIn addition to Spellman, writers for the series include Michael Kastelein, Derek Kolstad, Dalan Musson, and Josef Sawyer;[57] Kolstad joined the series' in July 2019,[58] and said he would be bringing \"a wink and a nod\" to the style of world building and character development from his film franchise John Wick.[59] He felt it was interesting to take secondary characters from the films and put them in primary roles for the series, and added that other characters from earlier MCU films are layered into the series and shift the storytelling in new ways.[60] Some early elements of the series were decided before Spellman was hired, including roles for the characters Helmut Zemo, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, and Sharon Carter. The latter becomes the Power Broker, which was inspired by a Captain America comic from the 1990s where Carter was exiled from S.H.I.E.L.D. and became \"super salty\".[33]\n\nComposer Henry Jackman described the series as a psychological drama,[61] while Mackie and Stan said it was \"part action-packed superhero epic, part awkward buddy-comedy\".[8] Stan compared the series' tone to the more realistic and grounded MCU film Captain America: The Winter Soldier.[62] He added that having a longer running time than a film allowed the series to explore the personal lives of the title characters and show what a day in each of their lives is like.[7] Spellman wanted to \"go home\" with the characters and let the actors show their skills rather than simply focus on action,[63] and he said the spirit and conflict of the title characters were what remained consistent as the project developed from his initial pitch to the final series.[7] He compared them to fire and ice, saying, \"Sam reacts spontaneously from the gut, and Bucky is more cold and calculated\".[6]: 1  Spellman said there was a \"12 second moment in Civil War where it feels like every single Marvel fan knew that [Wilson and Barnes were going to] be able to support a movie or a franchise\",[64] referring to a scene in which the two characters bicker over the placement of Wilson's seat. The series builds on the chemistry from that scene.[64][6]: 1  The writers also referenced the various press interviews done by Mackie and Stan to help craft the characters' onscreen dynamic.[64][65] Skogland and Spellman noted that Wilson and Barnes are not necessarily friends in the films, but they have Steve Rogers as a \"common denominator\". Without Rogers in the series, the pair's underlying relationship is now \"laid bare\" and forced to develop.[6]: 1  Stan said that without Rogers, Barnes and Wilson went into \"opposite corners in terms of facing their lives [and] their demons\", but they were each asking the same questions.[64]\n\nIf you want any honesty to them, you cannot avoid all the trauma that Bucky's been through, and you cannot avoid the fact that Sam is Black.\n\nThe series is set six months after the film Avengers: Endgame (2019),[3] which depicts Steve Rogers bequeathing his shield and the mantle of Captain America to Wilson.[9][66] Feige said this was intended to be a \"classic passing of the torch from one hero to another\", but when Marvel Studios got the opportunity to make television series for Disney+ they decided to expand this into an entire story about Wilson, who is a Black man, becoming Captain America.[10] Mackie elaborated that there was a specific \"brand of person\" that was expected of Captain America, and Wilson questions whether he should take up the mantle as a Black man who understands how different people see him.[6]: 2  Stan said Barnes feels protective of Rogers's legacy, and wants Wilson to become Captain America since he was Rogers's choice. The doubt that Wilson has about taking on the role becomes a conflict for Barnes in the series as well.[6]: 2  Regarding Wilson's progression in the series from being reluctant to wield the shield to ultimately using it, Skogland indicated that he needed \"to engage in both a public and private conversation of what it means for a Black man to pick up such an iconic historically White symbol\" which would help him define what it means to be a hero in modern society versus when Rogers became Captain America in the 1940s. Skogland also believed this was an important progression for the viewers to have along with Wilson since \"the shield means different things to different people\" and all aspects of it as a symbol needed to be explored.[67]\n\nFeige said the series would be more of a reflection of the real world than previous MCU projects.[68] Spellman felt the series was a nice progression from the themes of racial identity that were presented in Marvel Studios' Black Panther (2018), and was hopeful that the series would have a positive impact on Black youth like that film did.[53] He noted that in addition to himself and Moore, over half of the series' writing staff was also Black which reinforced the series' portrayal of Wilson as a \"decidedly Black character\".[69] Mackie said he was picking up the mantle left by Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman, who died in August 2020.[10] Once Skogland was hired, however, the racial themes were no longer as central to the series as they had been initially in Spellman's scripts.[70] Other \"hard-to-talk about issues\" that the series explores, according to Skogland, include ideas of patriotism and extremism, asking the questions: \"Who is an American, and who gets to decide what principles the country stands for? What compels people to take extreme actions in the name of what they believe is patriotism?\" Skogland noted that Captain America has always been used to explore political ideas, since the character's first comic book in 1941 where he was depicted punching Adolf Hitler. Stan said viewers would be able to compare events in the series to the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, though this was unintentional since the series was written before that event.[7]\n\nThe Blip—where half of all life in the universe disappeared in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and returned during Endgame—is the primary source of conflict for the series.[69] Spellman said they wanted this crisis to be something viewers could identify with,[24] and compared the Blip to the COVID-19 pandemic since both led to \"a world striving for stability after a global catastrophe\".[71][7] Each episode of the series explores whether the Blip will unite or divide the world.[3] The series' primary antagonists, the Flag Smashers, are an anarchist, anti-patriotism group who believe the world was better during the Blip.[19][24] The role for those characters had been created for the series and then the Flag Smashers name from the comics was chosen as an appropriate match, rather than the writers intentionally adapting the Flag Smashers for the series.[4] The Flag Smashers and Zemo both believe they are heroes and are responding to the Blip with views that others can acknowledge have some valid points.[4] Skogland believed setting the series six months after the Blip was critical, as that is when the complications of everyone returning begin to surpass the initial shock and joy.[3] Co-executive producer Zoie Nagelhout and Moore said the series shows Wilson and Barnes attempting to figure out their identities, and the Blip affects this.[6]: 2  Spellman added that identity is one of the main themes of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, as the story forces Wilson, Barnes, Carter, and Zemo to each \"rethink how they see themselves and confront how the world sees them\".[72] The series had planned to feature a storyline with Wilson and Barnes working to stop a fast-spreading disease, which had been rumored to be part of the Flag Smashers arc and was believed to have been cut from the series given the similarities to the COVID-19 pandemic; Spellman denied the storyline was removed because of the pandemic similarities.[73][74]\n\nSpellman created the series using his general knowledge of Marvel Comics and the MCU, along with that of Moore and Nagelhout, rather than basing it on specific comic books, though he did name Truth: Red, White & Black as a large influence on the series.[69] Moore disliked that comic, but liked the ideas it posed. He felt that Spellman, who strongly advocated for using elements of the comic, had integrated those story elements into the series in a smart way.[75] Feige was nervous about adapting Truth because he felt they would not be able to do justice to it and its main character, Isaiah Bradley, if they were only a small part of the series, but he changed his mind when he saw how central Isaiah was to the series' themes.[17] With the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney allowing Marvel Studios to regain the film rights to the X-Men and Fantastic Four properties, Marvel Studios was able to include elements from those properties in the series. This includes the location Madripoor.[76] Ahead of the series premiere, Spellman said there were three projects from Marvel Studios he knew of that would tie-in to the series.[16]\n\nWith the official announcement of the series in April 2019 came confirmation that Mackie and Stan would reprise their roles of Wilson and Barnes, respectively, in the series.[5] The next month, Daniel Brühl and Emily VanCamp entered negotiations to reprise their respective film roles of Helmut Zemo and Sharon Carter.[9] Brühl was confirmed for the series in July 2019,[25] and VanCamp was confirmed a month later when Wyatt Russell was announced as cast in the role of John Walker.[13] Russell's past work portraying \"the slacker with long hair and a beard\" did not lend itself to this role, but Marvel liked how his \"unique energy\" differentiated Walker from Wilson and Barnes.[6]: 5 \n\nSet photos in November 2019 revealed Adepero Oduye would appear in the series,[77] portraying Sam's sister Sarah Wilson,[20] Additional set photos in September 2020 revealed Georges St-Pierre would be reprising his role as Georges Batroc from Captain America: The Winter Soldier,[78] and that Erin Kellyman had joined the cast,[79] portraying Karli Morgenthau.[4] The following month, Danny Ramirez was cast in the \"pivotal role\" of Joaquin Torres.[80][4] Kellyman's involvement was confirmed in December.[81][82] In February 2021, Don Cheadle revealed that he appears in the series in his MCU role of James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes.[23] Florence Kasumba also reprises her role as Ayo from past MCU films.[35] Julia Louis-Dreyfus was cast as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. Louis-Dreyfus had been expected to first appear in Black Widow (2021) before delays pushed the film's release to be after the series.[36]\n\nIn December 2019, Desmond Chiam and Miki Ishikawa joined the cast,[83] and Noah Mills was cast a month later.[84] In February 2020, Carl Lumbly joined the cast as Isaiah Bradley.[85][46] A year later, the series' trailer revealed that Amy Aquino was playing Barnes's therapist.[86][42] Janeshia Adams-Ginyard and Zola Williams reprise their respective MCU roles of Nomble and Yama, members of the Dora Milaje.[49]\n\nProduction designer Ray Chan previously served as supervising art director on many MCU films.[87] Chan and the producers wanted to give the series a \"global feel\", with a focus on filming on location.[88] The general color palette for the series is dark and muted, with some exceptions: the Blip refugee camps are lighter and washed-out, Madripoor has more saturated colors, and Wilson's home in Louisiana has brighter colors and bolder prints.[89] Costume designer Michael Crow, who also previously worked on several MCU films, extrapolated from Wilson's streetwear looks in the films but added more color and texture to align with the series' brighter Louisiana scenes. For Barnes, Crow was influenced by the classic Americana style and wanted him to have the same \"flavor\" as Steve Rogers, wearing what someone from the 1940s who is trapped in modern times would wear.[90]\n\nThe series' superhero suits were designed by Marvel Studios' design team with input from Crow and the series' costume department.[90] Crow then looked to techniques used to make superhero suits for the films when bringing the new designs to life for the series.[89] Walker's Captain America suit is \"more structured, more armored, and darker\" than the suits worn by Rogers in the films, with the white sections removed.[90] His U.S. Agent costume from the end of the series is very similar to his Captain America suit, for practicality reasons, but has an updated color scheme based on the comics.[89] In contrast, Wilson's new Captain America suit has a lot of white in it which makes it stand out from the series' general muted look,[90] and provides \"a layer of hope and brightness\", according to Crow. The suit includes a comic-accurate cowl that Crow knew straight away was going to cause issues for the design team, and would require visual effects to complete. The suit also includes elements that show it was created by Wakandans, including metal wings that Wilson can use as a shield.[89]\n\nZemo wears a purple mask inspired by the character's balaclava from the comics. The series' version is a structured mask with material over the top.[89] Zemo's coat was intended to feel like an \"old Sokovian military uniform\", taking inspiration from traditional Slavic clothing and Polish and Russian overcoats from World War II. Fur was added to the coat to keep the costume faithful to the comics.[90] The design team intended for the Flag Smashers' masks to look like they bought cheap masks and painted on their logo themselves. They initially added a fabric layer to the masks for added texture, but felt this was too similar to Zemo's mask. The Flag Smasher's logo was designed by Marvel Studios' design team based on the comics.[89] For the Flag Smasher's clothing, Crow went with minimalist designs so they felt like they were coming from refugee camps.[90]\n\nThe series' main-on-end title sequence was created by Perception,[91] who took inspiration from the series' political messages and ideologies. The design features \"propaganda plastered across city walls [with] multiple layers of graffiti and flyers put up, torn down, and defaced\". Perception used movement and lighting to create a \"mysterious ambiance to match the show's atmosphere\",[92] and included various hidden messages and Easter eggs in the sequence,[91] such as references to the Enhanced Humans Act and Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross; the Sokovia Accords; Karli Morgenthau via a wanted poster that mentions various attacks by the Flag Smashers;[93] Madripoor and the Brass Monkey Saloon;[93][76] past attempts to replicate the Captain America program, including Isaiah Bradley being labeled a \"subject\"; and the Power Broker.[93]\n\nFilming began on October 31, 2019,[94] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[95][96] under the working title Tag Team.[97] Mackie and Stan announced the official start of filming on November 4.[98] P.J. Dillon was hired as cinematographer at the suggestion of Skogland, who he had worked with on the television series Vikings[99]: 2:36–3:06  Marvel Studios had decided early on in development to shoot The Falcon and the Winter Soldier as if it was a film, with one director and cinematographer filming all of the content at once based on available locations.[56][100] This was in contrast to a more traditional series that would often be broken up into filming blocks by episode and have multiple directors and cinematographers.[56] Dillon said emulating a film with the series' budget and schedule was their biggest challenge, but one that he, Skogland, and the rest of the production embraced.[101] Mackie compared the production to an MCU film, saying it felt like shooting a six-hour film that would then be cut up into individual episodes rather than filming one episode at a time.[102] Feige said the series would have the \"cinematic experience\" of an MCU film across six episodes,[103] while Skogland felt the series was \"relatable\" to the films since it featured \"action, comedy, [a] high-octane pace, familiar faces, and new characters\".[6]: 1 \n\nSkogland had plans for her visual approach to the series by the time Dillon was hired, at which point he revisited the MCU films to ensure that he was emersed in their \"visual language\".[99]: 4:26–4:48  To be consistent with the Captain America and Avengers films, they chose to retain the cinematic widescreen format by filming with anamorphic lenses, but they otherwise decided to not limit their visual style to what had been done previously in the franchise.[56] The main camera for the series was Panavision's DXL2 8K camera, with T series Panavision anamorphic prime lenses that Dillon had \"de-tuned\" to approximate the look of the older Panavision C series from the 1960s and 70s. This meant the lenses were imperfect which, combined with low light and on-set smoke, added texture to the footage.[104] Dillon said Captain America's shield was iconic, and it was important to him that it always be shown clearly and with the correct coloring whenever it was the focus of a shot,[105] so he designed the overall color palette and saturation levels for the series around how the shield looked.[101] Skogland was inspired by the films of David Lean and Midnight Cowboy (1969) for the series,[64] as well as the French film The Intouchables (2011). The Intouchables helped her \"feel secure in exploring some of the vulnerabilities\" of Wilson and Barnes, which translated to different approaches to filming each character.[106] For example, Skogland's approach to Wilson was having the camera further back to capture his surroundings,[106] while the approach for Barnes was to try \"be in his head\" by using close-up shots and a shallow focus that excluded the background.[107][106] She often used photographic references as inspiration for the visual approach to scenes, and wanted the series to have a \"slightly raw aesthetic, less perfect than maybe some big budget movie... a little bit edgier and a little bit rougher\".[108] Skogland encouraged Mackie and Stan to improvise on set and create a positive environment for the production.[56]\n\nLocation shooting took place in the Atlanta metropolitan area from November 2019 through February 2020.[109][110][111][112] Streets and neighborhoods in Atlanta were dressed to represent parts of New York City, Baltimore, Louisiana, and Washington, D.C. Sam's family home in Louisiana was filmed at an abandoned house in Savannah, Georgia, with the interiors built as sets at Pinewood.[87] Their family seafood dock was filmed at the Moon River on Skidaway Island.[113] Filming also occurred at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia, and at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama.[114] VanCamp filmed her role simultaneously with the television series The Resident, which was also shot in Atlanta.[34] In mid-January, filming was expected to take place in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, for two weeks, but production on the island was suspended due to a series of earthquakes that took place.[115] On March 3, the production was revealed to be moving to Prague, Czech Republic, for three weeks until March 25,[116] with filming in the city starting on March 6 and expected to continue until the week of March 16. However, filming was halted on March 10 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and members of the production returned to Atlanta.[117] Stan said filming would be completed once it was safe to do so,[118] estimating that there were at least two or three more weeks of filming needed.[62] In early May, the Czech Republic allowed television and film productions to start up if they followed new hygiene guidelines for cast and crew members,[119][120] and in June the head of the Czech film commission said cast and crew involved in film and television productions would be exempt from the European Union travel ban on U.S. citizens that was set to take effect on July 1.[121][122]\n\nProduction on the series was scheduled to resume at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in August 2020.[123] Dillon returned to his home in Europe when the production shut down and was unable to come back to the U.S. when filming resumed. He was disappointed not to return, but said the majority of filming had been completed before the shut down,[56] and there was already an amount of second unit and additional photography for the series that he did not shoot either which is not unusual for big productions.[124] According to the series' editors, most of the footage from the original filming dates covered the first, second, and fifth episodes, with the third, fourth, and sixth still needing a lot of shooting after the shut down.[125]: 40:05–40:55  Skogland said the crew knew exactly what they needed to film once shooting was able to begin again.[64][126] Filming occurred at Atlantic Station in Atlanta in early September,[127] and VanCamp finished filming her scenes for the series by the end of that month.[128] Filming in Prague resumed by October 10,[129] with locations including Olšany Cemetery and the Monastery of Saint Gabriel in Smíchov.[130] Mackie said the cast and crew followed strict quarantine and social distancing measures while filming in Prague.[131] Production on The Falcon and the Winter Soldier wrapped in Prague on October 23.[130][132]\n\nMarvel Studios hired editors with television experience to help with the fact that the studio had not made a television series before.[133] Kelley Dixon edited the first and fourth episodes, Todd Desrosiers edited the second and fifth, and Rosanne Tan edited the third and sixth.[100][125]: 21:05–21:17  Desrosiers previously worked with Skogland on the pilot episode of the television series NOS4A2 and Tan was suggested to Skogland by NOS4A2 showrunner Jami O'Brien.[133] Because the series was filmed based on locations rather than episodes, the editors received material out of order and had to work on different episodes at the same time.[100] They also continued to treat the series as a long film and sometimes moved scenes between episodes if that worked better for the overall story.[125]: 30:30–31:05  The editors were initially working in Atlanta alongside the rest of the crew, but when the production shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic they returned to Los Angeles and began working remotely and coordinating over Zoom.[133] Skogland said the crew used their time wisely during the shut down, allowing them to continue with post-production work and make decisions that they usually would not have time to make.[64][126] When production resumed, there was a reduced schedule for completing editing of the series. Jeffrey Ford was brought on as a supervising editor to work on all six episodes and help the other editors complete their work in time, having previously edited several MCU films including the Captain America and Avengers films.[100] The other editors had already been trying to match Ford's editing style from Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Ford became a mentor for them, helping them get used to the workflow of a Marvel Studios production and its visual effects requirements.[133] Because of the reduced timeframe to complete the series, the recaps that begin each episode were created by Tan's assistant editor, Caroline Wang.[125]: 49:15–49:38 \n\nVisual effects were provided by Cantina Creative, Crafty Apes, Digital Frontier FX, Industrial Light & Magic, QPPE, Rodeo FX, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Stereo D, Technicolor VFX, Tippett Studio, Trixter, and Weta Digital.[134]\n\nHenry Jackman, who scored Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War, began scoring the series by December 2020.[135] Because he was returning to the franchise after several years, Jackman started by creating an \"audio care package\" featuring different themes, orchestrations, and harmonies that he had composed for the Captain America films, to remind himself of that work and organize it before approaching music for the series. Jackman explained that the series format allowed him to write a wider range of music than the films since it still required music for big action sequences while having time for more quiet, character-based moments. He described the music for the latter sequences as being more patient, with \"lighter and thinner\" instrumentation. The many locations visited in the series also allowed Jackman to explore some environment-specific music, such as elements of the Blues genre when exploring Wilson's backstory in Louisiana, or electronic music for Madripoor which Jackman described as \"a grungy rave scenario\".[136]\n\nJackman reprises several of his themes from the films in the series: the composer expanded his Falcon motif from Winter Soldier into a full, classical superhero theme that he combined with some of the Blues elements to acknowledge Wilson's history (the new Falcon theme is used as the series' end credits theme, titled \"Louisiana Hero\");[136][137] Jackman's Winter Soldier theme, which consists of a \"scream\" and \"clangs\" that he described as \"the last fragments of a human soul trapped inside some mechanistic frame\", is heard during callbacks to the character's time as an assassin;[136][138] Zemo's \"spidery, kind of fractious\" theme from Civil War returns for that character;[136] and Jackman used an off-key version of his Captain America theme to represent John Walker.[136] Once Walker turns on the titular heroes, Jackman transitioned to the operatic theme that he used for Captain America fighting Iron Man in Civil War due to the similarity between the two situations.[139] The composer wrote a nostalgic motif for Barnes's civilian identity in The Winter Soldier that was tied to the character's 1940s history, but he decided not to use that in the series as he felt it did not suit the modern version of the character. Instead, he took an element from the end of his Winter Soldier theme that is played on strings in a \"disturbing\" octatonic scale and \"straightened [it] out\" into a diatonic scale to create a new civilian melody for the character. This is played on strings, piano, and guitar.[136][138] Jackman's theme for the Flag Smashers has a \"dystopian vibe\".[136]\n\nJackman's score was recorded by a 53-player orchestra in Berlin,[140] and was released digitally by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records in two volumes: music from the first three episodes was released on April 9, 2021,[137][141] and music from the last three episodes was released on April 30.[137][142] \"Louisiana Hero\" was released as a single on March 26.[137]\n\nA short teaser for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was shown at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, featuring Brühl as Zemo. The character wears his traditional purple mask from the comics in the teaser.[26] Skogland traveled to Budapest, where Brühl was filming The Alienist: Angel of Darkness, to capture the footage.[27] Concept art for the series featuring designs for the characters' costumes are included in Expanding the Universe, a Marvel Studios special that debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019.[63]\n\nIn December 2019, Feige debuted the first images from the series at Comic Con Experience, which Matt Goldberg of Collider described as more grounded than fellow Disney+ series WandaVision, with a \"standard spy thriller\" look similar to the Captain America films.[66] A commercial for the series, WandaVision, and Loki was shown during Super Bowl LIV.[143] Julia Alexander of The Verge said there was not much footage, but it offered \"enough glimpses to tease fans\".[144] Haleigh Foutch at Collider felt of all the Super Bowl commercials, Marvel's teasers \"stole the whole show\" and had \"a lot to get excited about\".[145] A trailer for the series was released during Disney Investor Day in December 2020. Writers for Polygon said the trailer \"certainly delivered\" and made the series look like it was similar in scope to an MCU film. They highlighted the series' villains which the trailer showcased, Zemo and the Flag-Smashers.[82] Angie Han of Mashable felt the trailer promised \"explosive action, a jet-setting plot, some very creepy villains, and—best of all—a return of the characters' odd-couple, best-frenemies dynamic\" from Civil War.[146] CinemaBlend's Laura Hurley said the trailer's action was so epic that it could be the trailer for an MCU film rather than a series.[147] Writing for io9, Charles Pulliam-Moore called the trailer \"nothing short of bonkers\".[148]\n\nA television spot was shown during Super Bowl LV which announced the release of the second trailer for the series.[149] Ben Pearson of /Film said the trailer was a return to the \"quippy, action-heavy, Marvel house style\" after the release of the less conventional WandaVision. Pearson wondered how this perspective would have been different if The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was released before WandaVision as was originally planned.[150] Ethan Alter at Yahoo! also compared the trailer to WandaVision, saying the series appeared to \"bring the fireworks audiences traditionally expect from MCU adventures\".[151] Rolling Stone's Brenna Ehrlich called the trailer \"replete with explosions, stomach-flipping stunts, and all manner of intrigue\".[152] Speaking to Sharon Carter's appearance in the trailer, Ian Cardona of Comic Book Resources felt that even though it was a few seconds, the character was \"finally getting the respect she deserves\" following her brief appearances in the MCU films.[153] Across various social media platforms, the trailer and television spot had more than 125 million combined views within 24 hours. The trailer became the most-watched for a streaming series, surpassing the 53 million views of the September 2020 WandaVision trailer. It also had 217,000 social media mentions and the highest Google Search volume among all entertainment offerings. Anthony D'Alessandro at Deadline Hollywood noted it was rare for analytics company EDO's top 10 most searched Super Bowl spots list, which measures searches within five minutes of a spot airing, to include a trailer rather than brand ads, but The Falcon and the Winter Soldier's spot was ranked fifth on the list.[154] According to YouTube, the trailer was the sixth most-watched Super Bowl LV ad on the site.[155]\n\nFour episodes of the Disney+ television series Marvel Studios: Legends explore the Falcon, the Winter Soldier, Zemo, and Sharon Carter using footage from their MCU film appearances.[156][157] The episodes focusing on Falcon and Winter Soldier were released on March 5, 2021,[158] with the Zemo and Sharon Carter episodes released on March 12.[157][158] Also in March, Xbox released commercials cross-promoting the series with the Xbox Series X and Series S and Xbox Game Pass. The commercials feature Mackie alongside DC Pierson as Aaron, a game store salesman, reprising his role from Captain America: The Winter Soldier where he was an Apple Store employee. Aaron is revealed to be Noobmaster69, the Fortnite player who Thor threatens in Avengers: Endgame.[159][160] A final trailer for the series was released on March 15. Austen Goslin at Polygon thought it was a good display of the series' story, action, and banter,[161] while Syfy Wire's Matthew Jackson felt it clarified that the series would be a personal fight. He said the trailers had shown that the series could \"open up the future for this particular corner\" of the MCU.[162] Discussing the final trailer for io9, James Whitbrook highlighted the emphasis on the physical and existential threats to Wilson and Barnes, and was intrigued by the portrayal of Flag-Smasher as a movement rather than a single character.[163] In June 2021, Hyundai Motor Company released a commercial featuring Mackie as Wilson / Captain America promoting The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and the Hyundai Tucson. The commercial was produced by Marvel alongside similar commercials for WandaVision, Loki, and What If...?, and was meant to tell an \"in-world\" story set within the narrative of the series.[164]\n\nIn January 2021, Marvel announced their \"Marvel Must Haves\" program, which reveals new toys, games, books, apparel, home decor, and other merchandise related to each episode of the series on the Monday following an episode's release.[165] On March 15, general apparel, Funko Pops, collectibles, accessories, and houseware for the series was revealed for the program,[166] with the \"Must Haves\" merchandise for the episodes starting on March 22 and concluding on April 26.[167][168] In July, Hasbro unveiled a series-themed version of Monopoly that was set to be released on August 10.[169]\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier debuted on March 19, 2021, on Disney+.[170] Its six episodes were released weekly, concluding on April 23.[171] The series was originally set for release in August 2020,[172] but was pushed back after filming was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.[173] This made it the second series released by Marvel Studios, after WandaVision, despite being developed first.[56] It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[170][174]\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray and Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on April 30, 2024, with SteelBook packaging and concept art cards. Bonus features include the featurette \"Cap's Shield\"; deleted scenes; a gag reel; and the Marvel Studios: Assembled documentary special \"The Making of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\".[175]\n\nDisney+ announced that the first episode, \"New World Order\", was the most-watched series premiere ever for the streaming service in its opening weekend (March 19 to 22, 2021), ahead of the premieres of WandaVision and the second season of The Mandalorian. Additionally, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was the most-watched title overall globally for that time period on Disney+, including in the Disney+ Hotstar markets.[176] Samba TV reported that 1.7 million households watched the episode in its opening weekend.[177] TVision determines viewing impressions by counting its 14,000 viewers on connected televisions who have watched at least two minutes of a title within a session of watching content for at least five minutes, across all major U.S. streaming and advertising video on demand services. The company reported that The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was the most-viewed series of April 2021 across measured platforms, being viewed nearly 40 times more than the average series measured by the service.[178]\n\nPercentage of positive critics' reviews tracked by the website Rotten Tomatoes[179]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 84% approval rating with an average rating of 7.25/10, based on 336 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Packed with blockbuster action and deft character beats, Falcon and the Winter Soldier proves itself worthy of Captain America's legacy with its globetrotting intrigue, mature social commentary, and the sparky rapport between stars Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan.\"[179] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 74 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[180]\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier was praised \"for bringing the Black experience to the forefront\" through its tackling of issues such as racial discrimination and confronting \"the original sins of America building itself on the backs of Black people\".[181] David Betancourt, reviewing the season finale for The Washington Post, analyzed the racial themes surrounding the character of Sam Wilson, a Black man, acquiring the mantle of Captain America. Noting that the series was originally planned to debut in 2020, before being delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Betancourt believed there was \"something eerily timely about a Black Captain America flying in the sky days after the verdict in the murder of George Floyd\" and also pointed to Barnes potentially being in a relationship with Leah, an Asian woman, also \"at a time when Asian Americans don't feel safe in America because of racist attacks\". While these occurrences happening in the series would not \"fix anything\", Betancourt said \"you can't help but feel something when you see it\".[182]\n\nBrian Lowry writing for CNN said, \"Overall the series deftly accomplished its primary mission, which was to explore the dramatic tension in Wilson becoming Captain America, in a way that went beyond just being told the shield now belonged to him. It also continued to demonstrate Marvel's ability to mount big, muscular action in productions for Disney+, while showcasing the depth of its universe.\"[183] Calling the series \"flawed but fun\", Brian Tallerico of Vulture stated that The Falcon and the Winter Soldier \"often felt rushed and lacked some depth in its analysis of race and power in this country\" but served its purpose as an origin story for Wilson's Captain America while setting up future MCU projects. In terms of how it would be remembered, he felt that it would be \"hard to gauge its full impact\" until its plot threads were picked up in future MCU projects, as was the case with most MCU entries.[184]\n\nThe pacing of the series received some criticism. In his review of the first episode, Alec Bojalad of Den of Geek believed releasing the series' episodes weekly was a detriment overall, since the first episode played as the first act of a larger story and felt \"frustratingly incomplete at times\" compared to how watching the full series at once would likely feel. This was in contrast to Marvel Studios' first series, WandaVision, which had been \"unquestionably an episodic experience\" with each episode standing on its own and having episode television-style cliffhanger endings.[185] By the third episode, Alan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone felt the series was \"leaning way into the 'six-hour movie' model at this point, where the only concern is advancing the plot by any means necessary, regardless of how interesting it is on its own\". He believed compared to WandaVision, which was \"very clearly built to be consumed weekly\", The Falcon and the Winter Soldier would have been better to view all at once than as weekly episodes.[186] Sepinwall ultimately concluded The Falcon and the Winter Soldier \"was trying to do way more than it could comfortably handle\", having too many characters and plot threads that writers could not successfully execute fully,[2] with individual episodes that felt \"sluggish\" despite a lot happening in them, because \"those various incidents don't do much beyond inching the plot forward\".[187]\n\nNoel Murray said in The New York Times that The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was \"largely enjoyable if scattershot\" given it \"meandered too much, shoehorning in too many side characters and too much Marvel mythology\". However, it was still \"a rush\" to see Wilson \"zooming through the air\", first as Falcon in the first episode, and then again as Captain America in the sixth episode, which was \"even more satisfying\".[188] Entertainment Weekly's Darren Franich gave the series a \"D\", believing there were glimpses of what the series \"could have been\". He said, \"this unmarvelous Disney+ quagmire buried its best instincts underneath uninspired cameos, geopolitical stupidity, and spin-off teases. Creator Malcolm Spellman struggled to keep Sam in the foreground, but the sprawling tale lost focus.\"[189]\n\nAhead of the final episode's release, Marvel Studios decided to submit The Falcon and the Winter Soldier in the drama series categories for the Primetime Emmy Awards rather than in the limited series categories. Moore said this decision was made around the series' premiere, with Marvel Studios feeling that the drama categories were appropriate for the series' more \"dramatic\" content. He added that there had not yet been any consideration for if Stan and Mackie would both be submitted for Outstanding Lead Actors or if one would be submitted for Outstanding Supporting Actor;[202] Mackie and Stan were ultimately both submitted for Outstanding Lead Actor.[203]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced.[204] The special on this series, \"The Making of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\", goes behind the scenes of the series, with Spellman, Skogland, Stan, Mackie, Russell, Kellyman, Cheadle, Brühl, VanCamp, Kasumba, Louis-Dreyfus, and others discussing the importance of racial issues within the narrative, the action scenes, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the production of the series. The special was released on Disney+ on April 30, 2021,[171] and was included as part of the series' home media release on April 30, 2024.[175]\n\nBefore the series premiere, Mackie said there had been no discussions regarding a second season of the series. He was also not sure when he would next appear in an MCU film, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on cinemas.[10] Skogland said she was unsure if there would be a second season and felt that she had been able to do everything that she wanted in the first six episodes, but she did say that there were more stories and characters to explore if a second season was made.[205] Feige said there were ideas for what \"another one\" could be if a second season was made, but Marvel intended for the series to lead into future MCU films first like they did with WandaVision.[64] He added that he did not want to spoil the series by confirming a second season or discussing the plans that Marvel had for the series' characters before the series was fully released.[16] In April 2021, Moore said the end of the series would show story elements for a potential second season, adding that the series explored \"evergreen\" topics that lent themselves to further exploration, unlike the contained story of WandaVision.[202]\n\nOn April 23, 2021, the same day the series' final episode was released, Spellman and series writer Dalan Musson were revealed to be writing the script for a fourth Captain America film that was expected to revolve around Wilson and continue from the events of the series.[181] Nick Romano of Entertainment Weekly believed a second season with the title Captain America and the Winter Soldier had been \"inevitable\" given the way the series ended. However, knowing the report about the fourth Captain America film added to the intrigue of what direction Marvel Studios would go in, considering past comments from Feige and others implying the series would get a proper second season.[206] Mackie was unaware of any plans for a film or second season, but was \"excited to see what happens\";[207] he had signed a deal to star in the film that August.[208] Julius Onah was chosen to direct the film in July 2022,[209] and the film was officially announced later that month at San Diego Comic-Con as Captain America: New World Order.[210] Ramirez and Lumbly reprise their roles in the film,[211] and are joined by Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns / Leader and Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, both from The Incredible Hulk (2008),[211][212] and Shira Haas as Sabra.[211] Harrison Ford appears as Thaddeus Ross, replacing original actor William Hurt following his death.[213] In June 2023, the film was retitled Captain America: Brave New World.[214] It is scheduled to be released on February 14, 2025.[215]\n"

        "content": "\n\nLoki is an American television series created by Michael Waldron for the streaming service Disney+, based on Marvel Comics featuring the character of the same name. It is the third television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) produced by Marvel Studios, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The series takes place after the events of the film Avengers: Endgame (2019), in which an alternate version of Loki created a new timeline. Waldron served as head writer and Kate Herron directed the first season, with Eric Martin and the duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead serving as head writer and leading the directing team for the second season, respectively.\n\nTom Hiddleston reprises his role as Loki from the film series, starring alongside Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Wunmi Mosaku, Eugene Cordero, Tara Strong, Owen Wilson, Sophia Di Martino, Jonathan Majors, and Neil Ellice. Sasha Lane, Jack Veal, DeObia Oparei, and Richard E. Grant also star in the first season, with Rafael Casal, Kate Dickie, Liz Carr, Ke Huy Quan and Richard Dixon joining for the second. By September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing a number of limited series for Disney+, centered on supporting characters from the MCU films. A series featuring Hiddleston as Loki was confirmed in November 2018. Waldron was hired in February 2019, and Herron joined by that August. Martin, who served as a writer on the first season, was revealed to be writing the entire second season in February 2022, along with Benson and Moorhead joining to direct the majority of the season's episodes; Dan DeLeeuw and Kasra Farahani also direct in the second season. Filming occurred in Atlanta, Georgia for the first season, with the second season being filmed in the United Kingdom.\n\nLoki premiered on June 9, 2021. Its first season, consisting of six episodes, concluded on July 14 and is part of Phase Four of the MCU. It received positive reviews from critics, especially for the performances. A second season, also consisting of six episodes, ran from October 5 to November 9, 2023, as part of Phase Five. It also received positive reviews, with praise for its conclusion, musical score, and Loki's character arc.\n\nAfter stealing the Tesseract during the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), an alternate version of Loki is brought to the mysterious Time Variance Authority (TVA), a bureaucratic organization that exists outside of time and space and monitors the timeline. They give Loki a choice: face being erased from existence due to being a \"time-variant\", or help fix the timeline and stop a greater threat. Loki ends up in his own crime thriller, traveling through time,[1][2][3] hunting a female version of himself named Sylvie.[4]\n\nAfter the first season ends with the timeline breaking and the creation of a multiverse,[5] the second season shows Loki teaming up with Mobius M. Mobius, Hunter B-15, and other TVA agents \"in a battle for the soul\" of the TVA. This includes a search through the multiverse for Sylvie, Ravonna Renslayer, and Miss Minutes.[6]\n\nBy September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for its parent company Disney's streaming service, Disney+, to be centered on supporting characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films who had not starred in their own films, such as Loki; the actors who portrayed the characters in the films were expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. These series were expected to be six to eight episodes each and have a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios, rather than Marvel Television which produced previous television series in the MCU. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,[48] focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.[49] Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed in November that a series centered on Loki was in development and that Tom Hiddleston was expected to reprise his role from the film series.[50]\n\nThe series was expected to follow Loki as he \"pops up throughout human history as an unlikely influencer on historical events\".[51] Marvel Studios chose to make a series about Loki because of his story potential, and because he had lived for thousands of years in the MCU and a series could fill in the blanks of his various unseen adventures.[10] The series also provided Marvel Studios the opportunity to work with Hiddleston more, explore the character beyond his supporting role in the films, and show him build new relationships rather than just developing his relationship with Thor.[10][52] This allowed Loki's previous film appearances to retain their integrity, so the series did not have to retread those storylines.[10]\n\nHiddleston considered Loki's death in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) to be the emotional end of his character arc, though he knew when he filmed the death scene that he would make a cameo appearance in Avengers: Endgame (2019).[53] That Endgame scene sees a 2012 version of Loki escape with the Tesseract, which was not intended by the writers to set up a future television series as Loki was not planned then. Hiddleston was unaware of where Loki had gone with the Tesseract when he filmed the scene in 2017,[10] and did not learn about plans for Loki until around six weeks before Infinity War was released. He kept plans for the series a secret until the official announcement later in 2018 and later expressed excitement about being able to develop Loki differently by taking an earlier version of the character and bringing him into contact with new, more \"formidable\" opponents.[53] Hiddleston worked with Marvel Studios executive and eventual series' executive producer Kevin R. Wright to create a 30-page document to define the series before any writers or directors were hired. The document included the main elements of the series, such as the Time Variance Authority, He Who Remains, and Victor Timely.[36][54]\n\nMichael Waldron was hired as head writer and executive producer of the series in February 2019, and was set to write the first episode.[51] In August 2019, Kate Herron was announced as director and executive producer.[55][56] In addition to Waldron and Herron, executive producers for the series include Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Stephen Broussard, and Hiddleston, with Wright as a co-executive producer.[57] The first season consists of six, 40–50-minute episodes.[58][59][60]\n\nLoki was originally planned as a single season, but during production of the first season it was realized that there was \"so much to explore with Loki\" and the story could continue;[61] Hiddleston and Wright began having conversations during production of the season one episode \"Lamentis\" regarding \"how this world could build out\" to \"dive deeper into it\".[36] Development on a second season had begun by November 2020.[62] In January 2021, Waldron signed an overall deal with Disney and part of that deal included his involvement in the second season of Loki \"in some capacity\".[63] Marvel Studios producer Nate Moore, who served as an executive producer on the series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, believed Loki had \"really irreverent and clever and cool\" storylines that lent to the series having multiple seasons rather than being a one-off event.[64] A second season was confirmed through a mid-credits scene in the first-season finale.[65] Herron said she would not return as director for the second season,[66] and in July 2021, Waldron said it \"remain[ed] to be seen\" if he would be involved.[67] In February 2022, the directing duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead were hired to direct a majority of the episodes for the second season,[68] while Eric Martin, a first-season writer who took over some of Waldron's duties during production on that season,[11] was set to write the six-episode second season. Benson and Moorhead previously directed two episodes of Moon Knight (2022), which went \"so smoothly\" that Marvel Studios wanted the duo to work on other projects, and they were quickly chosen for the second season of Loki. Hiddleston and Waldron were set to return as executive producers at that time.[68] Dan DeLeeuw, a visual effects supervisor and second unit director on several MCU films, and series' production designer Kasra Farahani were revealed as directors for the second season in June.[6][69] Wright was upped to executive producer for the second season,[54] and joined the season one executive producers with fellow Marvel Studios executive Brad Winderbaum, as well as Benson, Moorhead, and Martin.[70]\n\nRegarding future seasons, Wright called the series \"open-ended\", with no third season planned by the release of the second in October 2023. However, he thought there were still more stories to tell with the character in the world they created for the series, as well as the larger MCU, and was hopeful by the end of the second season, Loki would be in \"a certain place emotionally\" to have him rejoin the larger MCU, specifically meeting Thor. Wright also hoped that other MCU properties would use the TVA, feeling they could \"be this exciting connective tool for all of this storytelling\";[36] the TVA is featured in the film Deadpool & Wolverine (2024).[71]\n\nThe series begins after Avengers: Endgame, which saw Loki steal the Tesseract during the 2012 events of The Avengers (2012),[72] creating an alternate timeline from the main MCU films.[73] The first season sees the Loki time variant traveling through time and altering human history,[1][8] with a \"man-on-the-run\" and an \"unexpected\" science fiction quality to it;[74][75] the season also explores Loki's identity.[76][77] Loki falls in love with his female variant, Sylvie, in the season, which was a large part of Waldron's pitch for the series. He noted they were uncertain if portraying Loki falling in love with another version of himself was \"too crazy\". He continued by saying Loki was \"ultimately about self-love, self-reflection, and forgiving yourself\" and it \"felt right\" for the series be the character's first \"real love story\".[78]\n\nFeige stated in November 2019 that the series would tie-into Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,[79] but in May 2021 he would not reconfirm this or whether the series would tie in with any other MCU projects,[10] though he did say the series would \"lay the groundwork\" for the future of the MCU.[13]: 1  Waldron noted that, as with all MCU properties, the aim was for Loki to have \"wide-reaching ramifications\" across the franchise.[80] In the first-season finale, the \"man behind the curtain\" of the TVA is revealed to be He Who Remains, a variant of the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) character Kang the Conqueror. Jonathan Majors portrays both roles, and Waldron felt it made \"so much sense\" to introduce Majors in the series, since Kang is \"a time-traveling, multiversal adversary\" and thought to be \"the next big cross-movie villain\".[81] Marvel Studios was not initially planning to have \"The Multiverse Saga\", which comprises Phase Four, Phase Five, and Phase Six, revolve around Kang, but decided to after seeing Majors' performance in the episode and the dailies while filming Quantumania.[82] The first-season finale also sets up the events of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,[65] and elements of Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021).[83]\n\nThe second season helps connect the entire Multiverse Saga.[84] Wright stated that the creatives wanted to push the weirdness of the series further in the second season, while still keeping the longer, character-driven moments, notably the friendship between Loki and Mobius.[40] Much of the season was about each character becoming the best versions of themselves.[85] According to Martin, the themes of the second season were order versus chaos and \"what happens in a power vacuum\", likening the season's overarching concept to the phrase \"you break it, you buy it\", while still continuing the ideas of free will and destiny from the first season.[86]\n\nThe starring cast for the first season includes Hiddleston as Loki,[7] Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Ravonna Renslayer,[8] Wunmi Mosaku as Hunter B-15,[16] Eugene Cordero as Casey and later Hunter K-5E,[19][20] Tara Strong voicing Miss Minutes,[87] Owen Wilson as Mobius M. Mobius,[88] Sophia Di Martino as Sylvie,[28] Sasha Lane as Hunter C-20,[89] Jack Veal as Kid Loki, DeObia Oparei as Boastful Loki, Richard E.

        "content": "\n\nWhat If...? is an American animated anthology television series created by A. C. Bradley for the streaming service Disney+ based on the Marvel Comics series of the same name. It is the fourth television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) from Marvel Studios, the first animated series from the studio, and the first series produced by Marvel Studios Animation. The series explores alternate timelines in the multiverse that show what would happen if major moments from the MCU films occurred differently. Bradley served as head writer for the first two seasons, with Matthew Chauncey taking over for the third, and Bryan Andrews as the lead director.\n\nJeffrey Wright stars as the Watcher, who narrates the series, alongside many MCU film actors reprising their roles. Marvel Studios was developing the series for Disney+ by the end of 2018, with Bradley and Andrews on board. It was officially announced in April 2019. Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding helped define the series' cel-shaded animation style, which was designed to reflect the films and take inspiration from classic American illustrators. Animation for the series was provided by Flying Bark Productions and Stellar Creative Lab, with Blue Spirit and Squeeze also working on the first season and SDFX Studios working on the second. Stephan Franck was head of animation for the first season and a director on the second and third seasons, with Scott Wright as head of animation for the second and third seasons. Chauncey was the series' story editor before replacing Bradley as head writer.\n\nThe first season of What If...? premiered on August 11, 2021, and ran for nine episodes until October 6, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. The second season was released daily from December 22 to 30, 2023, and the third and final season premiered on December 22, 2024, also releasing daily; both are part of Phase Five. The series has received generally positive reviews, with praise for the voice acting, animation, creative storylines, and scenarios, although the episodes' length and writing received some criticism. An interactive augmented and virtual reality story for the Apple Vision Pro headset, What If...? – An Immersive Story, was released in May 2024, and a spin-off series titled Marvel Zombies is set to premiere in October 2025.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the multiverse in the first-season finale of Loki, What If...? explores various alternate timelines across the multiverse in which major moments from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films occur differently, as observed by the Watcher.[1][2] In the second season, following the formation of the Guardians of the Multiverse, the Watcher continues to explore more strange worlds, meeting new heroes and keeping the multiverse safe.[3]\n\nThe series is narrated by Jeffrey Wright as the Watcher, a member of the alien Watcher race who observes the multiverse,[4][5][6] in a similar role to Rod Serling's in The Twilight Zone.[7] Head writer A. C. Bradley said the character is \"above everything else\" and compared him to a viewer of the \"pizza rat\" video, observing and not interfering as he has \"no interest in becoming friends with the rat, living amongst the rat, or doing rat things... That is the Watcher's relationship with humanity.\"[8] Executive producer Brad Winderbaum felt Wright's performance inspired a sense of humanity to the character,[9] and Bradley explained that Wright was cast because his voice mixes power, charisma, and authority with a \"warm personality\".[8] Wright approached the character like he would a live-action role, learning as much as he could about the Watcher so his voice could reflect the character's \"uniquely powerful, all-seeing, sagely presence\". Wright chose a contemporary American accent rather than having the character sound like \"some Oxford-educated, old, fusty guy in a tudor parlor somewhere\",[7] and aside from researching the character's comic book appearances, took inspiration from the series' tone, visuals, and animation when developing the character's voice.[10]\n\nFor the second season, Wright was able to see how his performance played with animation for the first-season episodes, allowing him to make some adjustments to his performance such as adding \"a bit more mystery to the voice and a bit more distance\" to further the notion that the Watcher is \"not entirely present\".[11] The third season further explores the character's humanity, with Winderbaum calling it a \"fulfilling culmination\" for the character,[12] and saying the Watcher \"presents himself as uncaring, and cold, and just an observer, but he cares more than everybody\".[13][12] The comic book name \"Uatu\" is not used at the start of the series because this would imply that there was more than one being watching the series' events when Bradley instead wanted to focus on the narrative of \"the Watcher\" observing the different characters and realities and how those affect him.[14]: 12:04–13:35  The third season introduces additional members of the Watcher race–the Eminence, the Incarnate, and the Executioner–and reveals Wright's Watcher is named Uatu.[15]\n\nMore than 50 actors reprise their MCU film roles in the first season,[16]: 2 [17] while over 30 reprise their roles in the second season,[18] and over 35 reprise their roles in the third.[19]\n\nBy September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing several series for its parent company Disney's streaming service, Disney+; Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige was set to take a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,[20] focusing on \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films.[21] One of these was an animated series for Disney+ based on the Marvel Comics run What If...?,[22] which entered development in 2018.[23] The anthology series, which would be produced by Feige, would explore how the MCU would be altered if certain events had occurred differently, such as if Loki wielded Thor's hammer Mjolnir. The hope was to have the actors who portray the characters in the MCU films voice them in the series as well.[22] A. C. Bradley was suggested as head writer for the series by Marvel Studios executive Jonathan Schwartz after unsuccessfully pitching as a writer for Captain Marvel (2019).[16]: 1  Bradley was eager to write a Marvel film due to her love for the franchise, and felt What If...? was her opportunity to create many Marvel stories.[24] Marvel Studios was impressed that some of Bradley's ideas for the series matched concepts they were planning for films, and she joined the project in October 2018.[25]: 74 [26] One of the concepts Marvel had devised that they asked Bradley to pitch on was what would happen if a 1980s Avengers team formed after a young Peter Quill came back to Earth; this concept would eventually be evolve into the second season episode, \"What If... Peter Quill Attacked Earth's Mightiest Heroes?\".[23] Bryan Andrews, a storyboard artist on many of the major action sequences from the MCU films,[16]: 1  met with Brad Winderbaum—the Marvel Studios executive in charge of the series—about directing the series as early as 2018.[27][28] Bradley and Andrews were officially announced in their roles in August 2019.[29]\n\nIn April 2019, Disney and Marvel officially announced the series.[1] Marvel Studios had discussed adapting the What If...? comics in the past, but decided not to do so until after the conclusion of the Infinity Saga so they would have enough storylines to create alternate options of. Making the series animated allowed the studio to explore all of these ideas \"unbounded\".[27] Winderbaum said it was not a coincidence that the series was set for release so soon after the first-season finale of Loki, which introduced the multiverse, since What If...? explores facets of the multiverse in a way that Winderbaum believed made the series as important as any other MCU property;[2] Bradley confirmed that all episodes of the series are canon to the MCU multiverse,[30] with most of the episodes taking place in their own universe.[31] The creative team of What If...? met with Loki executive producers Stephen Broussard and Kevin R. Wright as well as WandaVision (2021) co-executive producer Mary Livanos to establish a \"rule book\" regarding the multiverse, its branch timelines, and nexus events.[32]\n\nThe episodes are approximately 30 minutes in length,[33] though Marvel Studios had originally told Bradley and Andrews to aim for 35 to 40-minute episodes; early production issues for the series resulted in the reduced run time.[34]: 20:56–21:04  In December 2019, Feige revealed that the first season would consist of 10 episodes, and that work had already begun on a second 10-episode season.[35] However, because of the production delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, an episode of the first season was not completed in time and was moved to the second season, bringing the first season to nine episodes; the second season was also reduced to nine episodes.[33] Work on a third season began by July 2022,[36] when Bradley revealed that the second season was her final project with Marvel Studios.[37][23] Story editor Matthew Chauncey takes over as head writer for the third season,[23] which was announced in August 2024 to be the series' last,[38] and consists of eight episodes.[6] A Red Guardian-centered episode written by Bradley that was intended for the second season was released in the third.[23] Stephan Franck joined Andrews as director for the second and third seasons.[39][6] In November 2024, Winderbaum explained that the series was ending due to \"bigger [MCU] reasons\" that were being determined in real time as different projects were released within the Multiverse Saga. He said it was the right time for the series to conclude \"from a story perspective\",[40][41] but did not rule out reviving it in the future.[40]\n\nExecutive producers for the series include Winderbaum, Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Andrews, Bradley,[16]: 2  and Dana Vasquez-Eberhardt,[6] with Carrie Wassenaar, Danielle Costa, and Alex Scharf producing.[16]: 2 [6] In July 2021, ahead of the release of What If...?, Alonso noted that Marvel Studios was creating an \"animation branch and mini studio\",[42] known as Marvel Studios Animation,[43] to focus on more animated content beyond What If...?.[42] During Marvel Studios Animation's panel at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, What If...? and the other projects discussed were introduced as being part of the \"Marvel Animated Multiverse\".[36]\n\nFeige explained with the series' announcement that it would take \"pivotal moments\" from throughout the MCU and change them.[1] Winderbaum felt it was \"creatively healthy\" to think of What If...? as its own parallel world that \"lives and breathes on its own terms\" and did not need to have exact adaptions from the main MCU or comics.[9] He added that it was liberating to work within the multiverse concept because the series could take greater risks or opportunities that other MCU projects are not afforded when they are concerned with connecting to future properties.[25]: 75  Alonso said the series was an opportunity to introduce more diversity to the MCU and take advantage of more of the 6,000 characters that Marvel Studios had access to.[28] Marvel Comics characters who have yet to appear in the MCU are not introduced in the series, but the writers considered creating new characters if it helped the story.[27] For example, Sam Wilson / Captain America could not be included in the first two seasons because the scripts were written before The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021) had aired, with Bradley noting it \"makes sense, you let the character live in live-action first and then go play in the multiverse\";[44] Wilson's Captain America later appeared in the third season.[45] Regarding new characters, this was first done in the second season with the introduction of Kahhori, a young Mohawk woman in an alternate timeline who seeks to discover her new-found powers after the Tesseract crash-lands in the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in pre-colonial America where European colonization has not occurred.[46][47][48]\n\nWriting for the first season began in 2018,[23] with the story arcs for the second season conceived during brainstorming sessions in 2019,[48] ahead of writing for the season between January and October 2020.[23] Each episode had an approximately 40-page script when first written.[34]: 20:54  Because of the long-lead production for animation, there was not an opportunity for audience reactions to the first season to impact the creatives' work on the second season.[48] Some of the initial 30 concepts that were not chosen for the first season also appear in future seasons.[9][49][50][48] Episodes of the series were written by Bradley, Chauncey, and Ryan Little.[6] Bradley stated that the first season was requested to highlight the \"headliner\" characters, such as Tony Stark, Black Panther, and Doctor Strange,[23] as well as to only explore \"what if\" concepts for MCU stories from the Infinity Saga;[31] as such, Phase Four characters do not appear until the second season,[51][18][52] with Bradley and the writers also focusing more on the \"scrappy\", second string characters of the franchise such as Nebula, Darcy, and Hela.[23] Andrews noted that following the first season, in which the \"what if\" concept were only small changes from what was established, further seasons were able to \"expand out\" beyond these small moments and \"get a little bit wackier\".[50] As the writers were developing the initial scripts, they realized that Captain Carter would \"bubble up and became more important\" alongside the Watcher, and decided to revisit her story in each future season.[53]\n\nEach episode and its alternate storyline is introduced and concluded by the Watcher, presenting it as \"a cautionary tale in the spirit of The Twilight Zone\".[16]: 1 [7] The episode's tones vary, with some being darker or lighter than the MCU films that they play-off.[54][23] Despite the series' anthology format, the writers conceived a story device for the first season that allowed them to have some connectivity between the episodes;[31] this begins to be revealed in the first season's eighth episode before the finale in the ninth,[55] which saw the formation of the Guardians of the Multiverse, whose members were the various characters introduced in the preceding episodes.[56] Along with Captain Carter, some of the storyline elements from the first season with Doctor Strange Supreme and the Watcher are continued in the second season,[48] with Strange Supreme becoming the villain of the season.[23]\n\nMarvel's plan for the series was to have actors who portray characters in the MCU films reprise their roles in What If...?,[22] with more than 50 doing so in the first season.[16]: 2 [17] Feige revealed half of these actors at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2019,[4][57] along with Jeffrey Wright being cast as the Watcher, who narrates the series.[4][5][6] The additional actors reprising their roles for the first season were revealed in August 2021.[17] Several characters in the series are voiced by different actors than those who portrayed them in MCU films.[58] Winderbaum attributed some of the replacements to scheduling conflicts with the original actors,[59] and explained that the creatives did not want the series to be \"defined by the actors we thought we could get\". When casting replacements, they looked to prioritize the performance for this series over an actor sounding the same as the original. Winderbaum felt the series' exploration of the multiverse gave a \"cerebral justification\" for the different actors.[60] Over 30 actors reprise their MCU roles in the second season,[18] with some of the different, recast voice actors reprising their roles from the first season.[52] Over 35 actors reprise their MCU roles in the third season.[19]\n\nThe series features a cel-shaded animation style with character likenesses based on the actors from the films.[61] Ryan Meinerding, the head of visual development at Marvel Studios, developed the animation style for the series with Andrews.[8] They considered using different styles for each episode,[24] or basing the look on comic art by Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko,[16]: 3–4  before settling on a single style inspired by classic American illustrators such as J. C. Leyendecker, Norman Rockwell, Tom Lovell, and Mead Schaeffer.[16]: 3  Andrews felt this resulted in a \"kind of heroic, hyper-realized, super-idealized look that feels iconic\" while not being \"pushed or cartoony\",[16]: 2  while Meinerding felt this was a unique approach to translating cinematic superheroes into animation that took advantage of the medium's stylization without losing the realistic, \"monumental and powerful\" feeling of the films.[62] Disney's Lady and the Tramp (1955) was also an influence due to its lack of \"harsh line work\" and because they felt it was \"beautifully painted\".[16]: 3  Traditional 2D animation was considered but was abandoned when Marvel could not find studios who could handle the necessary work.[27] Instead, the animation is \"2.5D\", with 3D models rendered with 2D lighting to appear like flat drawings.[63] Andrews enjoyed the opportunity to mix his knowledge of animation with the MCU, believing there was \"an embarrassment of riches\" in the storytelling they were able to achieve.[16]: 1 \n\nAlonso said the medium of animation allowed Marvel Studios to work with new companies around the world.[28] Stephan Franck serves as head of animation on the first season.[64][65]: 9  Scott Wright serves as animation supervisor for the majority of the second season,[66]: 26:41  with Franck joining Wright on the fourth episode,[67]: 29:30  and serving as sole supervisor on the fifth.[68]: 28:38  Wright returned as the animation supervisor for the third season.[69] Flying Bark Productions and Stellar Creative Lab worked on all three seasons of the series,[70][71][72] with Blue Spirit and Squeeze also working on the first season[16]: 4 [73][74] and SDFX Studios working on the second.[75]\n\nThe series' opening title sequence was designed by Perception, who sought to emphasize the series' themes by displaying \"the beauty and idea of space\". The sequence draws inspiration from the work of film poster artist Bob Peak, particularly his artwork for Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) and Excalibur (1981), and uses imagery of glass shattering to symbolize the branching of the Sacred Timeline.[76]\n\nBy October 2020, Laura Karpman was set to compose music for the series,[77] which she called \"the perfect composer playground\" since she was able to reference existing MCU scores but also deviate from them.[78] Karpman and the producers were inspired by Alan Silvestri's approach to the Avengers: Endgame (2019) score for how to incorporate existing music from different MCU films. She explained that Silvestri weaved his own music into other composer's themes, and generally just touched on different elements from the existing music, so her approach for the series became \"touch on [existing themes], then go on\".[79] Karpman had access to the sheet music and recordings of previous MCU scores but also adapted some elements by ear. For each episode, she looked at how the story aligned with the MCU, how it deviated from the MCU, and what the story itself required musically.[80]\n\nWhen writing the series' main theme, Karpman knew that the opening sequence would feature images of shattered glass. She recorded the sound of shattering glass and manipulated it to create sound effects that were added to the theme. The main melody is played on a French horn, with Karpman singing in the background as a reference to 1960s science fiction scores that featured female vocalists.[80] Additional choir is also used in the main theme, singing phrases backward such as \"what if\", \"Marvel\", and \"Stan Lee\".[81] Soundtrack albums for each episode of the first season, featuring Karpman's score, were released digitally by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records from August 13 through October 13.[78][82]\n\nFor the second season, Karpman was joined by her wife Nora Kroll-Rosenbaum.[83] A five-track EP for the third episode, \"What If... Happy Hogan Saved Christmas?\", was released digitally on December 15, 2023.[84] A soundtrack album for the season featuring selections of Karpman and Kroll-Rosenbaum's score was released digitally by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on January 5, 2024.[85] Karpman returned for the third season.[86]\n\nWhat If...? debuted on Disney+ on August 11, 2021;[87] the first season consists of nine episodes that were released weekly until October 6.[33][88][89] It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[90] Winderbaum said it was their intention to release a new season of What If...? annually.[91] The second season premiered on December 22, 2023, and its nine episodes were released daily until December 30.[92] The third and final season premiered on December 22, 2024, with its eight episodes being released daily until December 29.[93] Both are part of Phase Five.[94][95]\n\nAccording to market research company Parrot Analytics, which looks at consumer engagement in consumer research, streaming, downloads, and on social media, What If...? was the most in-demand new series that debuted in the U.S. from July 1 to September 30, 2021, achieving 17.5 times more demand than the average show during that period.[96] Internationally, it secured the eighth position in the ranking for the most-demanded digital series in Ecuador, achieving 2.11 times more demand than the average series, for the week of October 24–30, 2021.[97]\n\nAccording to the file-sharing news website TorrentFreak, What If...? was the sixth most-watched pirated television series of 2021, raking behind Hawkeye.[98][99] In 2022, Nielsen Media Research, which records streaming viewership on U.S. television screens, announced that What If...? and Star Wars: The Bad Batch each appeared on its streaming charts for a combined total of seven weeks from May to October, collectively accumulating approximately 2 billion minutes of viewing time.[100][101] What If...? held the title of Disney+'s biggest animated series premiere until it was surpassed by Dream Productions in 2024.[102][103]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 89% approval rating with an average rating of 7.85/10, based on 123 reviews for the first season. The site's critical consensus reads: \"What If...? may not add much to the larger MCU narrative, but surprising takes on beloved characters and some of the best action sequences in the entire franchise make for engaging viewing.\"[104] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the first season a score of 69 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[105]\n\nThe second season has a 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's critics consensus states: \"In its superlative sophomore season, What If...? reaffirms its status as one of the most consistently creative outposts in the sprawling MCU.\"[106] Metacritic assigned the second season an average score of 79 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[107]\n\nThe third season has a 81% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10.[108]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced.[119] The special on this series, \"The Making of What If...?\", goes behind the scenes of the making of the first season, and was released on Disney+ on October 27, 2021.[120]\n\nWong is guided by the Watcher to assist the player in collecting Infinity Stones from throughout the multiverse. It is ultimately revealed that Wanda Maximoff is posing as the Watcher to collect the Stones and the player must join other multiversal allies to defeat her. After regaining possession of all the Infinity Stones, the player can choose to keep them and start a new timeline or destroy them to save the multiverse and be recruited as a Guardian of the Multiverse.[121]\n\nIn May 2024, Marvel Studios and ILM Immersive announced What If...? – An Immersive Story, an hour-long interactive mixed reality Disney+ original story for the Apple Vision Pro headset. The story was directed by Dave Bushore and written by David Dong and Phil McCarty, which sees users encounter variants of MCU characters from throughout the multiverse, learn the mystic arts, and harness the power of the Infinity Stones.[122][123] Characters that appear include the Watcher,[122] Wong, Thanos, Carol Danvers, Captain America, Red Guardian, Hela, the Collector, Wanda Maximoff, Vision, Captain Carter,[121] Starfox,[124] Miss Minutes, and Deadpool (through the use of archival footage from the 2024 film Deadpool & Wolverine),[125][121] among others. Bushore, Dong, and McCarty worked with the What If...? production team to create the new character variants seen in the experience.[122] Bushore was excited to focus the \"what if\" scenario around Maximoff and Vision to help give the characters their \"happy ending\" that they have not gotten in the main MCU.[121] Laura Karpman returned from the series to compose music for the experience, and series director Bryan Andrews served as a consulting producer. Executive producers include Bushore, Winderbaum, ILM Immersive's Shereif M. Fattouh, Vicki Dobbs Beck, and Mark S. Miller, and Walt Disney Studios' Jamie Voris.[122][123] A trailer was released on May 22, with the experience made available as a free app on the Vision Pro for a limited time on May 30.[126]\n\nWes Davis from The Verge described An Immersive Story as an \"overlong, no-stakes video game tutorial — with no game to follow it\". Davis enjoyed the experience's visuals and thought the movement gestures for the various abilities available to you were fun to do, but lamented the fact that these were constrained to specific, scripted moments in the experience. The story is constructed through a series of vignettes, which Davis noted had a similar pattern to their execution. He concluded that the experience \"sits in a noncommittal, unsatisfying middle zone\", and was hopeful any further updates or support for it from ILM Immersive would see the introduction of multiple branching paths within the story.[127] An Immersive Story won Outstanding Innovation in Emerging Media Programming at the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards.[128]\n\nIn November 2021, a Marvel Zombies animated series was announced, with Andrews returning to direct and Zeb Wells serving as head writer, focusing on \"a new generation of heroes\" battling zombies.[3] It is a continuation of the reality first introduced in the fifth episode of What If...?, that \"look[s] at that universe with a different lens\".[129] Nine MCU actors reprise their MCU roles in the series.[130] It is scheduled to premiere on Disney+ in October 2025 and will consist of four episodes.[130][131]\n\nWinderbaum said there was potential for the variant characters in the series to appear in live-action, just as \"what if\" concepts from the Marvel Comics eventually made their way into the main comics continuity.[27] Andrews and Hayley Atwell both expressed interest in a live-action film starring the latter as Captain Carter,[132] though Atwell wanted the right creative team that could \"pave the way for [Carter] to tap into the cultural consciousness of today and become a modern heroine of our times\".[133] Atwell first reprised the role in live-action in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness as an alternate version of the character from Earth-838 (separate from the versions seen in What If...? and the main MCU) who is a member of the Illuminati.[134] A spin-off series centered on Star-Lord T'Challa had been in development but was left in \"limbo\" after Boseman's death.[135]\n"

It is the sixth television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to be produced by Marvel Studios, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. It follows Marc Spector and Steven Grant, two alters of a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID), as they are drawn into a mystery involving Egyptian gods. Slater serves as head writer with Mohamed Diab leading the directing team.\n\nOscar Isaac stars as Marc Spector / Moon Knight and Steven Grant / Mr. Knight, with May Calamawy, Karim El Hakim, F. Murray Abraham, Ethan Hawke, Ann Akinjirin, David Ganly, Khalid Abdalla, Gaspard Ulliel, Antonia Salib, Fernanda Andrade, Rey Lucas, Sofia Danu, and Saba Mubarak also starring. The series was announced in August 2019, with Slater hired in November. Diab was hired to direct four episodes in October 2020, with directing duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead joining in January 2021 to direct the other two. Isaac was confirmed to star at the time; he used different accents to differentiate Spector's various identities. Filming took place from April to October 2021, primarily in Budapest as well as in Jordan, Slovenia, and Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nMoon Knight premiered on March 30, 2022, and ran for six episodes, concluding on May 4. It is part of Phase Four of the MCU. The series received positive reviews, with particular praise for the performances (particularly those of Isaac, Calamawy and Hawke), the darker tone compared to previous MCU series, and its portrayal of DID.\n\nMarc Spector, a mercenary who has dissociative identity disorder (DID), is drawn into a deadly mystery involving Egyptian gods with his multiple alters, such as Steven Grant.[2]\n\nShaun Scott recurs in the series as the living statue Crawley.[43] Also guest starring are Lucy Thackeray and Alexander Cobb as Grant's co-workers Donna and J.B., respectively,[44][12] Díana Bermudez as Yatzil, the avatar of the Egyptian goddess of love Hathor, Declan Hannigan as the avatar of the Egyptian god of kinship Horus, Hayley Konadu as the avatar of the Egyptian goddess of moisture Tefnut, Nagisa Morimoto as the avatar of the Egyptian goddess of magic Isis,[35] Loic Mabanza as Mogart's bodyguard Bek,[45] Joseph Millson as Dr. Steven Grant from the fictional film Tomb Buster, while Bill Bekele portrays his young assistant Rosser, Claudio Fabian Contreras as Spector's younger brother Randall, and Usama Soliman as Layla's father Abdallah El-Faouly.[12]\n\nThe character Marc Spector / Moon Knight was to be introduced in the planned second season of Blade: The Series before its cancellation in September 2006. A potential spin-off series for the character had also been in development.[46] In October, Marvel Studios partnered with No Equal Entertainment to produce a separate television series featuring Moon Knight.[47] Writer Jon Cooksey was hired to develop the series by 2008, but it did not move forward.[48] James Gunn, the writer and director of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy films, said in January 2017 that he had discussed a Moon Knight film with Marvel Studios but did not have time to work on it;[49] he later said that he had mentioned the idea in passing to Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige and several others, but did not have a full pitch for such a film as had been reported on from what he initially stated.[50] Feige confirmed in April 2018 that Moon Knight would be introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but questioned, \"Does that mean five years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now?\".[51] That August, M. Raven Metzner, who served as showrunner for the second season of the Marvel Television series Iron Fist (2017–2018), revealed that there had been discussions about including Moon Knight in the season during its development.[52]\n\nIn August 2019, Marvel Studios announced at the D23 conference that a series based on Moon Knight was being developed for the streaming service Disney+.[53] That November, Jeremy Slater was hired to serve as the head writer and executive producer of the series,[2][54] which consists of six 40–50-minute episodes.[55] Egyptian director Mohamed Diab was set to direct four episodes in October 2020,[56][57] as well as executive produce the series. Marvel had approached him \"out of the blue\" to present a pitch for Moon Knight,[56] which includes Egyptian mythology and characters that the superhero is associated with in the comics. Diab and his writer-producer wife Sarah Goher put together a 200-page document outlining their vision for the series, which included their intention to depict Egypt and Egyptian people in a more positive way than they felt had been done in previous Hollywood productions. Diab elaborated that American films and series often used Orientalist stereotypes such as portraying Egyptian people as exotic \"guides and desert wanderers\" or ignoring the fact that the Giza pyramids are beside Cairo, a modern city. He wanted to portray Egyptians as \"normal human beings\" and Egypt as a \"normal place\" like modern America, while also hiring other Egyptian crewmembers to work on the series.[58] He added that the series would be \"hard, serious and about big topics\" like many of his previous feature films.[56] By November 2020, director duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead were asked to create a pitch for the series, after previously having had discussions with Marvel Studios about finding a project to work on together.[59] They joined the series to direct the other two episodes in January 2021,[56][60] working alongside Diab to ensure a consistent approach to the series.[61] Marvel Studios' Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Brad Winderbaum, and Grant Curtis also serve as executive producers along with star Oscar Isaac,[62] with Goher as a consulting producer,[21] and Nick Pepin as the production and development manager for the series.[63] The budget for the series was $147.9 million.[1]\n\nIn February 2021, Feige said some of Marvel's series, including Moon Knight and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022), were being developed with the potential to have additional seasons made, in contrast to series like WandaVision (2021), which were developed as limited events that lead into feature films instead.[64] A year later, Isaac referred to Moon Knight as a limited series,[11][65] while Diab was unsure whether the series would continue.[66]\n\nMichael Kastelein, Beau DeMayo, Peter Cameron, Sabir Pirzada, Alex Meenehan, Rebecca Kirsch, Matthew Orton, and Danielle Iman serve as writers on the series,[67] with an archeologist specializing in Egyptian tombs consulting with the writers.[68] Feige likened the series to the Indiana Jones franchise while exploring Egyptology,[3] two aspects that were a large part of Slater's pitch given that he wanted to tell a \"dark, complex story\" mixed with \"big, fun, supernatural, Amblin-style magic\".[68] Slater said he wanted the series to have a similar tone to Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Ghostbusters (1984), and bring some horror aspects and monsters to the MCU. He wanted to push the limits with how dark a Marvel series could be, which Feige and Marvel Studios were supportive of.[69] The Mummy (1999) was also an inspiration.[18] Feige said there was a clear difference in tone between Moon Knight and the other Marvel Studios Disney+ series released at that point, adding that the studio worked with Disney+ to push the boundaries on how much of Moon Knight's brutality they could present in the series.[11]\n\nFeige said title character's mental illness was a unique aspect of the series,[10] which primarily focuses on his psychological trauma.[70]: 54  Dr. Paul Puri, a board-certified psychiatrist and an assistant clinical professor at UCLA, served as a consultant for the series regarding its depictions of mental illness.[13]: 5  Diab did caution that though the creatives were respectful of dissociative identity disorder (DID), the series still exists in a fictional, supernatural world and some elements were \"over-dramatize[d]\".[8] He suggested using reflections to portray the conversation scenes between Grant and Spector, which became a recurring theme of Moon Knight.[71] The series draws on the character's more modern interpretations in the comics regarding DID, such as each identity losing a sense of time when not in control.[72][73] Each episode's end credits conclude with a message encouraging viewers to visit the website of the National Alliance on Mental Illness to learn more about DID.[74] Jeff Lemire and Greg Smallwood's run in the comics served as primary inspiration for the series. The Bill Sienkiewicz and Warren Ellis runs on the character were also inspirations for their visuals and the introduction of the Mr. Knight persona, respectively.[18] Executive producer Grant Curtis said the series explored identity and \"finding one's true self\", adding that Grant and Spector would look to \"reconcile portions of [their] past, present and potential future that [they don't] necessarily agree with\". Isaac believed the series would be \"experiential\" for viewers to connect with \"the psychological horror of not knowing what's happening and the slow revelations of the truth\" that came with portraying the character's DID. Slater added that the creatives took the series' depiction of mental health seriously, researching the disorder and aiming for Moon Knight to have a positive portrayal and message regarding mental health.[9]\n\nSlater said the series would not heavily feature the aspects of Moon Knight in the comics where he was a playboy philanthropist, since that version of the character had been likened to the DC Comics character Batman which was not a comparison that Slater wanted to make.[75] Slater added that exploring Moon Knight's mental health allowed them to be more than \"a palette-swapped Batman clone\", adding that he was \"his own greatest enemy in a lot of ways\".[9] He instead chose to pull from the character's \"monster-hunting past\" from the comics.[18] Isaac believed Moon Knight was \"the first legitimate Marvel character-study\" since Iron Man (2008),[5] with Curtis adding that the character was like Stark for Marvel Studios in that he could be \"built from the ground up\".[13]: 2  Steven Grant is the focus of the series in the early episodes opposed to Spector, who is the main alter from the comics. When researching past comics for the series, Slater found that he always enjoyed Moon Knight, but did not like Spector since he was \"not necessarily the easiest character to love\". He was able to more easily approach a character archetype like Grant and \"how to make [the audience] fall in love with that character\", so he refocused the series to be \"a sort of weird buddy show\" where Spector could serve as Grant's protector to ensure he had a happy ending.[18] Early in development, Grant was the identity who became Moon Knight while Spector would have become Mr. Knight, but these were eventually reversed.[76] The existence of the third alter, Jake Lockley, is hinted at throughout the series before appearing in the final episode's mid-credits scene. Slater noted that all of the creatives worked to find the proper balance of how many overt hints to leave regarding Lockley, deciding to focus on viewers unfamiliar with the character from the comics and creating a satisfying mystery for them. Each of the directors worked with their cinematographers to find moments in the earlier episodes that could be \"confusion\" where Lockley could enter and exit. For example, when Grant returns in the first episode from the cupcake truck chase, a shot of a mirror features barely a third reflection.[17]\n\nDuring the series' development, Marvel Studios was interested in including the character Maya Lopez / Echo in one of their projects. Because the character is a love interest of Spector's in the comics, Slater and the writers considered using Lopez that way in the series as well. However, she did not fit the story they were trying to tell and Marvel Studios eventually decided to use Lopez in their Hawkeye (2021) miniseries instead. This decision was supported by the Moon Knight creatives.[77] Marlene Alraune, Spector's most prominent love interest in the comics, was also not included because she was deemed to be the \"prototypical damsel in distress\" seen in many older comics. Slater felt any lead female character needed to be more like Marion Ravenwood from Indiana Jones, someone who could \"go toe to toe with the boys\". This led to the creation of the character Layla El-Faouly,[18] originally named Zayna Faoul,[78] who has \"one foot in her Egyptian heritage and one foot in the mercenary world\".[18] Diab pushed for the character to be Egyptian,[8] with Slater adding that had she been a white character alongside Spector, also traditionally a white character in the comics, they would have encountered \"white savior tropes and some of the weird imperialism and colonialism problems\" that countries such as Egypt have dealt with. During development, it was decided to give the character superpowers and the creatives took the name of the first Egyptian hero from the comics, Scarlet Scarab, to give to her.[18] Diab noted that he had not specifically connected El-Faouly to that character from the comics.[16]\n\nThe antagonists for the series are Arthur Harrow and the Egyptian goddess Ammit, two lesser-known villains from Moon Knight's comics history. Slater said there was \"[a] lot of trial and error\" in choosing the villains, noting the most \"logical\" villain to use was, Bushman, Moon Knight's most famous villain, since he has a direct tie to the character's origins. However, when trying to include the character in the series, Slater only saw him as \"a guy with a gun, which made him too dangerous to go up against Steven Grant\" and to solve that, they would need to give him superpowers; this also proved challenging because Slater could not find \"enough real estate\" to make Bushman have \"an actual emotional connection to the story\" while also avoiding the racist tropes the character presented over the year,[18] and because he felt too similar to Black Panther (2018) villain Killmonger.[79] The writers then decided to create an original villain for the series, Harrow, tying him to Spector and Grant's past by having him be a former avatar of Khonshu,[18] and despite being a similarly named, but different, character in the comics,[70]: 54  chose the name \"Arthur Harrow\" because \"it sounded cool\".[18] Commentators also believed Harrow included elements of other Moon Knight characters such as the Sun King[72][80][81] and Morning Star.[70]: 54 \n\nThe supernatural elements inspired from the comics include various Egyptian gods, one of whom, Khonshu, manipulates Spector in a way that draws on their \"toxic\" relationship from the comics.[13]: 2, 7  The series is set in the MCU in early 2025,[13]: 3 [82][83] but has no explicit connections to other parts of the MCU,[13]: 2  with some planned references to the actions of Gorr the God Butcher from Thor: Love and Thunder (2022) removed during the writing process. Slater said this was done because they did not naturally fit the series, and because it was unclear during development when the series would be released in relation to that film. This is also why its place in the MCU timeline was left vague.[84][85] There were also discussions regarding including Dane Whitman, with Steven Grant working at the same museum as him, but Slater stated there was \"never any logical reason for him to be in the show\" as it would not have progressed his Black Knight storyline. The Eternals Kingo and Makkari were also planned to appear during a flashback sequence showing the fall of Ammit and the death of Alexander the Great. The creatives also considered the budgetary implications of adding other stars to the series, deciding it was better spent for the series' visual effects and other areas of production.[18] Diab added that they found the story to be \"so psychologically complicated\" and intriguing that they did not need the \"crutches\" of MCU references. Isaac said Moon Knight's \"most important thing was an emotional truth to the journey that was happening\" rather than its MCU plot ties. It is partially set in London, rather than New York City like the comics, to differentiate the series from the other MCU projects set in that city.[8]\n\nIn October 2020, Oscar Isaac entered negotiations for the lead role,[86] and was said to have been cast in January 2021;[60][87] Marvel Studios officially confirmed the casting that May.[88] Isaac was initially hesitant to join the series, as he was wary of being in another franchise after experiencing how much time and effort was required to film the Star Wars sequel trilogy. He accepted the role after researching DID further and becoming fascinated with Grant's characterization for the series,[15] as well as being given creative freedom from Feige.[71] Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter felt Isaac's recent major acting roles could draw audiences unfamiliar with the character to the series, and that his Latino ethnicity could allow an examination of Judaism from different perspectives, rather than having the character be depicted as an Ashkenazi Jewish man like in the comics.[89] Isaac later confirmed that the character would be portrayed as Jewish-American in the series.[9]\n\nIn January 2021, May Calamawy was cast in the \"key role\" of Layla El-Faouly,[68][90] and Ethan Hawke was cast as Arthur Harrow, the series' main villain.[91][92] Goher had approached Calamawy on social media to convince her to audition,[23] and had included Calamawy in her and Diab's pitch presentation for the series.[25] Isaac had initially approached Hawke about joining the series, and Diab asked Hawke not to read the scripts before signing on because he wanted to develop the character with the actor. Diab was thankful that Hawke trusted him and Isaac enough to join them without seeing the scripts, which Hawke said he had not done in 35 years.[66] He explained that he joined the series because of Isaac, Diab, and where he felt he was in his acting career, and he enjoyed the creative freedom that came with the series telling a lesser-known story.[93] Gaspard Ulliel joined the cast by July 2021 as Anton Mogart,[94][95] in one of his last roles before his death in January 2022.[94] F. Murray Abraham was revealed to be voicing Khonshu in February 2022,[27] having been approached for the role;[26] Karim El Hakim provided the on-set performance of the character.[13]: 7  Ann Akinjirin and David Ganly also star as police officers and Harrow's followers Bobbi Kennedy and Billy Fitzgerald, respectively,[34] while Khalid Abdalla stars as Osiris' avatar Selim,[35] and Antonia Salib stars as the Egyptian goddess Taweret.[38] Sofia Danu and Saba Mubarak were the on-set performer and voice of the Egyptian goddess Ammit, respectively.[41][42]\n\nLucy Thackeray was revealed to be portraying Donna in the series' trailer, released in January 2022.[44] Additional castings were revealed ahead of the series' premiere in March, including Rey Lucas as Marc's and Steven's father Elias Spector,[40] Fernanda Andrade as Wendy Spector, Marc's mother,[39] Saffron Hocking as Dylan,[96] Shaun Scott as Crawley,[43] and Díana Bermudez as Yatzil.[35] Other guest stars included Alexander Cobb as J.B.,[12] Declan Hannigan as the avatar of Horus, Hayley Konadu as the avatar of Tefnut, Nagisa Morimoto as the avatar of Isis,[35] Loic Mabanza as Bek,[45] Joseph Millson as Dr. Steven Grant, Bill Bekele as Rosser, Claudio Fabian Contreras as Spector's younger brother Randall, and Usama Soliman as Layla's father Abdallah El-Faouly.[12] The majority of smaller Egyptian roles went to Egyptian actors, including those living in Budapest,[28] such as Ahmed Dash, Hazem Ehab, Amr Elkady, and Zizi Dagher.[97]\n\nStefania Cella serves as the production designer,[13]: 8  working with Egyptologists and an Egyptian supervising art director to ensure historical accuracy in her sets. She meticulously worked on details to bring realism to the sets. Her Chamber of the Gods set was three stories tall and decorated with yellow hieroglyphs related to divinity. The Burial Chamber set featured hieroglyphs and water and reflective surfaces to represent the series's themes of duality and identity.[13]: 9–10  Grant's attic apartment was constructed to resemble the pyramids, while Harrow's residence was made to be commune-style in the Spitalfields/dockyard part of London. The Mogart's Mansion set included two Louvre-inspired glass pyramids that were built for filming.[13]: 9–10  Two Egyptian housing block sets were also built.[28] The hospital in the Duat was designed based on the combination of the iconography of hospitals and Harrow's private space in the second episode.[98][99] The same set was used, with its set dressings for the commune removed and then painted white as Cella thought it the best way to represent Spector's perception of reality was by using the same location and instead making it a part of the hospital in Spector's consciousness.[99] She used the color white because she felt it was associated with \"hygiene and operation and gowns\" and also thought that it \"is the color of, 'Am I there or I'm not there?' Because it sometimes is the white space and then it's paradise\", which she thought helped contribute to the story.[98]\n\nMeghan Kasperlik serves as the costume designer.[100] Diab wanted the costumes to have a lot of Egyptian symbols and iconography, with Kasperlik finding ways to include \"those subtleties but still representing Egyptian culture today and also Ancient Egyptians symbols from the past\".[101] She also worked with Cella to ensure the same symbols on the sets were incorporated into the costumes.[102]\n\nGrant's costumes were meant to evoke the \"coolness\" of Brixton but with some elements \"off\",[13]: 11  with Kasperlik finding vintage shirts in New York for the character, and later incorporating a \"clunkier shoe to weigh this character down\" and a Chore coat.[102] Spector has a \"desert look with a tactical, utilitarian and lighter costume\". He also has a hoodie and vest with multiple functions which was foreshadowing for Moon Knight's cape effect.[13]: 11  Arthur Harrow's costumes are \"monk-like\" inspired by real-life cult leaders, while El-Faouly has a more athletic look with Cairo and London influences.[13]: 12  Harrow has Ammit's death prayer inscribed on his bracelet, while El-Faouly's Egyptian touches are subtlety featured in her jewelry. El-Faouly also has teases throughout the series hinting at her becoming the Scarlet Scarab, such as her pants being the same print as when she is in the Scarlet Scarab suit.[101] Most of El-Faouly's costumes were custom-made, despite their contemporary appearance.[102]\n\nMoon Knight's costume consists of armor and Ancient Egyptian bandages, with hieroglyphic-like symbols on his cape,[11][9][13]: 12  which feature Khonshu's oath and are in a repeating pattern on the underlining in a foil-like fabric.[103] The moon crest on his chest, from which he spawns his crescent darts, also contains the oath of Khonshu, while additional hieroglyphs on his pants that state \"Rise and live again as my fist of vengeance. My Moon Knight.\"[105] His mummy bandage design is based on the Universe X version of the character from the comics, and was designed to conjure around Spector, giving it a supernatural quality and helping to differentiate it from similarly forming hero suits in the MCU that use nanotech. Feige suggested taking the bandage design and combining it with the character's more modern design in the comics.[104] She ultimately chose to separate the costume into many layers and not turn it into a molded piece with the piece and texture on top, as she wanted to incorporate symbolism of Khonshu into her design.[102] The Moon Knight suit was created by FBFX in London, and consisted of over 803 different pieces.[101] It was created out of a flexible \"Euro jersey\" material, and featured 3D printed textures and colors to give it depth and texture.[106]\n\nFor Mr. Knight, Kasperlik created a three-piece suit based on his design in the comics, with various homages to Khonshu in the design. She added designed sneakers to modernize the look.[13]: 12  The buttons on his waistcoat feature Khonshu's symbols.[105] She also wanted to pick a fabric that would not be flat white, would have a texture, and would not get \"blown out\" during nighttime filming and look like \"a white marshmallow running across the screen\", choosing a white-on-white textured fabric with a silver lame in it.[101] The logic behind the designs of the Moon Knight and Mr. Knight suits was inspired by who each identity was, what they love, and their imagination. With Grant \"completely away from the superhero world\", he summons a costume that resembles a suit as Mr. Knight.[76][22] Both the Moon Knight and Mr. Knight suits contained Khonshu's symbol.[103]\n\nKhonshu, Taweret, and Ammit's costumes were made for each character, despite each being CGI characters.[107][101] To create Khonshu's costume, Kasperlik read previous comics and researched various types of fabrics and how she could make it tattered. She used six different types of fabrics that were all hand-sewn and stretched so the actor could wear it comfortably. A custom leather collar and leather strips were added over the chest area to emphasize his symbol, while a belt, which was sculpted and molded, also goes around his waist.[103] The practical costume pieces for Taweret consisted of a scarab, breastplate, gold bracelets, \"several layers of feathers that plumed out\", and hieroglyphs carved into various elements, with Salib calling Taweret \"a very fashionable goddess\". Salib also wore platform shoes to mimic hippo feet as well as a motion capture pole to aid in the extra height of the character.[38] Given Taweret is the goddess of childbirth and fertility, her headpiece features the birthing dance and prayer of ancient Egypt,[107] which was a replica of a piece of Egyptian artwork. Much of her costume was constructed by in-house leather works and metalsmiths. Both Khonshu and Taweret had their prayers and oaths incorporated into the various symbolisms on their costumes.[103]\n\nThe series' main-on-end title sequence was designed by Perception. The company sought inspiration from ancient Egyptian artifacts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, working with Curtis in crafting a sequence which focused on the series' dark and mysterious tone. Reflections serve as recurring imagery in the sequence, and Perception also included several Easter eggs referencing certain elements of the series.[108] Each episode's end credits feature a new phase of the moon, starting with a crescent moon in the first episode.[109]\n\nFilming was expected to begin in March 2021,[110][111] and was confirmed to be underway by the end of April in Hungary.[112] The series was filmed under the working title Good Faith,[113][114] with Diab directing the first, third, and final two episodes and Benson and Moorhead directing the second and fourth.[8] Moorhead explained that he and Benson were \"handed\" the second and fourth episodes to direct, in part because of logistical reasons, but also because each of the episodes were designed to have \"its own voice\", though the first two episodes connect a little more closer to each other because the creatives were still \"figuring out the production\" then. He continued that the location of the fourth episode was \"very much its own thing\", allowing the duo to \"cordon off a little bit\", while the final two episodes are \"their own voice from each other and from the rest of the episodes\".[59] Gregory Middleton was the cinematographer for Diab and Andrew Droz Palermo served the role for Benson and Moorhead.[87][13]: 24–25  Soundstage work occurred at Origo Studios in Budapest.[13]: 8  The series was previously expected to begin filming on November 16, 2020, to last for 26 weeks, but this was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[111][114] Filming occurred at the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest in April,[112] which served as exteriors for London's fictional National Art Gallery,[13]: 10  and in Szentendre at the beginning of May.[115] In early June, outdoor night scenes were filmed at Madách Square in Budapest.[116] Various exterior locations in Budapest were found to stand-in for London, particularly the Brixton and Soho areas.[13]: 10–11 \n\nFilming also occurred in Slovenia,[117] for one week in Wadi Rum, Jordan, and concluded in Budapest and Jordan by the beginning of October,[56][118] at which point production moved to Atlanta, Georgia.[56] It had wrapped by October 14.[119] Isaac said filming felt \"handmade\",[5] with Diab bringing local authenticity and attention to the smallest details such as including the correct text of a prayer over a shop.[70]: 54  Hawke was appreciative of the Egyptian Diab for leading the series, since he did not approach the series \"with the eyes of an American\", but as someone who had grown up in the country.[13]: 8  The production had hoped to film the series in Egypt but were unable to in part because of the country's political climate and censorship issues; Hollywood production had not been able to shoot in the country for some time.[28]\n\nAdditional photography was completed by mid-November,[120] and Diab said there was much less reshooting required for the series than on other Marvel Studios projects, occurring over four days.[76] He, Isaac, and Hawke attributed this to the large amount of rehearsing and discussing that they did before filming each episode, including regular Sunday brunches with the main cast and crew. Hawke said these meetings helped form a \"collective imagination\" for the series that made it easier to switch between Diab's episodes and those directed by Benson and Moorhead, since the \"imaginative force behind it was the same\".[61]\n\nAbraham joined the series later in the process and had multiple recording sessions where he was encouraged to provide different takes and ideas for the material. He came up with various vocal options, ultimately settling on the one he enjoyed and was the best fit for the character.[26] Cedric Nairn-Smith serves as an editor on the series for the first and sixth episodes, Joan Sobel for the second and fifth episodes, and Ahmed Hafez for the third and fourth episodes, while Sean Andrew Faden serves as the visual effects supervisor.[13]: 26–28  Visual effects for the series were created by Framestore, Image Engine, Mammal Studios, WetaFX, and Zoic Studios.[121] A large portion of Cairo was digitally created by Weta, who found the Giza pyramid complex particularly difficult to recreate.[122]\n\nEgyptian composer Hesham Nazih had composed the score for the series by early March 2022 in his first major English language project.[97][123] He used an orchestra of 62 musicians and 36 singers,[124] which were recorded at Synchron Stage Vienna,[125][124] while soloists playing Egyptian folk instruments such as the arghul, mizmar, and rebab were recorded in Cairo. Nazih felt the folk instruments had a \"prominent presence and sonority\" within the score and did not work against the \"texture\" of the classical orchestra.[124] Diab was drawn to Nazih to score the series because his work \"encompasses authentic Egyptian elements in a very contemporary way\",[28] with the music helping to break Egyptian stereotypes by revealing some of the country's lesser-known contemporary art to international audiences; Diab described it as a \"beautiful score that is Egyptian, but it's international at its core, it's universal\".[58] Nazih's themes for Moon Knight and Harrow \"chase[d] one another and sometimes collided\".[124]\n\nThe series' soundtrack used a mixture of older and newer songs as a way to showcase Cairo's music scene, which has similar sensibilities to the West, without resorting to songs that would feel like they were from the Middle Ages.[28] Marvel Music and Hollywood Records released the first episode's end-credit track from Nazih, \"Moon Knight\", as a digital single on March 30, 2022,[126] followed by the series' soundtrack album on April 27.[127]\n\nThe first footage of the series debuted on Disney+ Day on November 12, 2021.[128][129] A trailer was then released on January 17, 2022, during the 2021–22 NFL playoffs,[130] with James Whitbrook at Gizmodo noting that it gave a full look at the character following the brief Disney+ Day footage. He said the costume was faithful to the comic book version, \"albeit more textured-looking\".[130] Daniel Chin from The Ringer highlighted the use of the song \"Day 'n' Nite\" by Kid Cudi, and felt that Moon Knight was \"shaping up to be one of [Marvel's] darkest and most distinctive projects to date\", due to its darker tone, incorporation of horror elements, depiction of violence, and how the series introduced a new character into the MCU rather than focus on previously established characters.[131] Richard Newby at The Hollywood Reporter felt the trailer was \"relish[ing]\" in the general audience's lack of knowledge about the character by maintaining a sense of mystery. He also felt the series looked like it would be one of the darkest and most original projects from Marvel Studios,[72] which was echoed by his colleagues Aaron Couch and Borys Kit, who said the trailer suggested \"something unlike any other Marvel show\".[132] Isaac's British accent for the Steven Grant identity received mixed responses from viewers, and Isaac himself made fun of it in a video where he and Hawke reacted to the trailer. Isaac later said the accent was intentionally unconvincing.[4] The trailer was viewed over 75 million times in 24 hours, which was better than trailers for Marvel Studios' other Disney+ series, except The Falcon and the Winter Soldier's Super Bowl LV trailer which had 125 million views. Additionally, its social engagement of 263,000 mentions were the highest of any Disney+ Marvel series for their first content release.[132] An additional trailer aired during Super Bowl LVI on February 13,[133] which continued to keep the series mysterious while depicting its \"darker sensibilities\", according to Screen Rant's Rachel Labonte.[134] Ben F. Silverio of /Film said the shots of Moon Knight's cape \"flung out into the shape of a crescent moon\" and the character catching his moon-shaped weapons were the \"coolest\".[135] RelishMix reported the trailer had 9.49 million views in 24 hours across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram.[136]\n\nThe \"Marvel Must Haves\" merchandise program, which reveals new toys, games, books, apparel, home decor, and other merchandise related to each episode of Moon Knight following an episode's release, started for the episodes on April 1 and concluded on May 5, 2022.[137][138] Also in April, Marvel and National Geographic released a featurette exploring how the series approached and researched all of the Ancient Egyptian iconography for the sets and story.[139]\n\nQR codes were included in the first two and final two episodes linking viewers to a website to access free digital comics featuring Moon Knight that updated weekly.[140][141] The comics released for the six episodes, in order, were Werewolf by Night #32 and #33, Moon Knight vol. 1 #3, Universe X #6, Moon Knight vol. 1 #1, and Moon Knight Annual vol. 2 #1.[142][143][144] Each had a connection to a character or visual reference that appeared in that week's episode. By the release of the finale, Disney announced the site was visited over 1.5 million times, with 500,000 full comics read. Adam B. Vary of Variety called the initiative \"a savvy way to expand viewers' comic book knowledge\" for the more obscure character of Moon Knight. Curtis explained that he had been fascinated with the engagement the animated series Bob's Burgers had with their gags in the opening and closing credits and their \"burger of the week\", and believed that interactivity could be brought to Moon Knight to \"help educate viewers on Moon Knight's comic book history\". When filming at the storage locker facility in \"Summon the Suit\", which already had existing QR codes on their doors, Curtis realized that would be the way to \"organically incorporate QR codes into the environment\".[140] He had originally thought of another idea for the engagement that Marvel was unable to execute technologically.[144] The visual effects team then inserted the live QR codes with CGI into the episodes where codes could naturally be found, which was why codes were not included in the third, fourth, and sixth episodes (outside of one in its post-credits scene) as they would \"stick out as a gimmick\" in those environments. Curtis was hopeful the project would continue for other MCU films and series.[140] Viewers who scanned the code were also sent an exclusive, digital poster after the series finale of the \"SPKTR\" license plate.[145]\n\nMoon Knight debuted on Disney+ on March 30, 2022.[146] It consists of six episodes,[55] releasing weekly until May 4.[147] A special screening occurred on March 16 at Cine Capitol in Madrid,[148] and on March 17 at the British Museum in London,[149] with the red carpet premiere on March 22 at El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles.[150][151] It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[152]\n\nMoon Knight was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray and Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on April 30, 2024, with SteelBook packaging and concept art cards. Bonus features include the featurette \"Egyptology\"; deleted scenes; a gag reel; and the Marvel Studios: Assembled documentary special \"The Making of Moon Knight\".[153]\n\nParrot Analytics, which looks at consumer engagement in consumer research, streaming, downloads, and on social media, reported that Moon Knight had the most in-demand United States series premiere in the first quarter of 2022. It had 33.4 times the average demand of all other series in the U.S. during its first 30 days.[154] According to the file-sharing news website TorrentFreak, Moon Knight was the fourth most-watched pirated television series of 2022.[155][156]\n\nPercentage of positive critics' reviews tracked by the website Rotten Tomatoes[157]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 86% approval rating with an average rating of 7.65/10, based on 240 reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Its entertainment value may wax and wane a bit, but Moon Knight ultimately settles into a mostly enjoyable—and refreshingly weird—spot in the MCU firmament.\"[157] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 69 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[158]\n\nMatt Webb Mitovich at TVLine gave the series' first four episodes an \"A−\", saying it \"subvert[s] and perhaps wildly exceed[s] any tempered expectations\", enjoying the unpredictability the series brought compared to Marvel Studios' other Disney+ series centered on established characters. Mitovich also praised the visuals of Moon Knight and the acting, particularly that from Isaac.[159] Variety's Daniel D'Addario praised the show's \"high-stepping riskiness\" and \"freshness ... that's enticing even for those outside the fandom\".[160] Giving the first four episodes of the series four out of five stars, James Dyer wrote in his review for Empire that Moon Knight was \"a boldly bonkers affair that manages to capture the same giddy joy imbued in Hawkeye and Loki\", delivering \"something that feels genuinely different from any corner of the MCU yet explored\". He added, however, that \"the larger narrative is at times less compelling than the quirky character work\".[161]\n\nDaniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter was more critical of the series, thinking the series was \"more successful as an Oscar Isaac acting exercise than a superhero thrill-ride\". Fienberg was frustrated by the lack of Moon Knight and clarity to his skill set and stated the series \"feels intended less as a TV show and more as an explanation for why viewers would want to watch the character eventually\" join up with other MCU characters. He did appreciate Diab's culturally-appropriate depictions of Egypt.[162] Rolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall gave the series 3 out of 5 stars, enjoying Isaac's performance as both Grant and Spector, but feeling there was \"precious little to feel excited about\" in the series beyond that. Though Sepinwall became more engaged by the conclusion of the fourth episode since the story pivots \"more into the darkness inherent in the character\", he did not have high hopes for the series conclusion given past MCU Disney+ series faltered in their finales and the character's history of \"being more exciting in theory than reality\".[73]\n\nWith the series' conclusion, Richard Newby also of The Hollywood Reporter, believed the series felt \"the most unfinished in terms of completing the story setup\" of any of the MCU properties and called the \"lacking sense of narrative completion\" puzzling. He continued that despite the uncertainty of additional seasons or if Isaac would return to the role, the final episode left viewers wanting more, especially with multiple story points still able to be explored further, and Newby wondered if Moon Knight would have been better served with more episodes to reach a more satisfying conclusion and give more depth to the character and his part of the MCU.[41]\n\nBy April 2022, Marvel Studios and Disney planned to submit Moon Knight in the various limited series categories for the Primetime Emmy Awards, along with Hawkeye.[170] However, by the final episode's release in May, a promotional tweet for the episode initially called it a \"series finale\", before being deleted and shared calling it a \"season finale\", despite no indication of any further seasons. Clayton Davis at Variety noted that this change could force the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences to reject Moon Knight in the limited series categories given their rules and use of past social media and interviews in determining eligibility, necessitating the studios to submit the series in the drama categories,[171] along with Loki.[170] Despite this, Davis noted Moon Knight was still planned to be submitted in the limited series categories,[171] which Disney and Marvel ultimately did.[172]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced. The specials go behind the scenes of the MCU films and television series with cast members and additional creatives.[173] The special of this series, \"The Making of Moon Knight\", featured Isaac[174] and was released on Disney+ on May 25, 2022.[175] It was included as part of the series' home media release on April 30, 2024.[153]\n\nIn November 2019, Feige stated that after introducing Moon Knight in the series, the character would cross over to the MCU films.[176] Diab stated in March 2022 that he felt the character would be part of the MCU for the next ten years and expressed his hope that Moon Knight would eventually get his own feature film.[66] At the time of the series' premiere, Isaac had not signed on to return as the character in future projects,[8] and by the finale, Diab and Curtis were unsure of the character's future, be it in a second season, feature film, or part of another character's property.[177] Diab hoped a potential second season would be able to film in Egypt.[28] Isaac was open to returning \"if there was a story that really made sense\", with Calamawy and Hawke also expressing interest in returning.[178] In August 2022, Isaac stated that he was grateful for being able to explore the character and tell the story of this series without the burden of being locked in to future projects, adding there was an option to do more but it was not \"imperative\".[179] In October, Isaac confirmed that he had begun having conversations with Marvel Studios to reprise the role of Moon Knight, be it in a second season or another project. Isaac was concerned about having another story for the character that was \"worth telling\" and \"interesting\".[180]\n"

        "content": "\n\nMs. Marvel is an American television miniseries created by Bisha K. Ali for the streaming service Disney+, based on the Marvel Comics featuring the character Kamala Khan / Ms. Marvel. It is the seventh television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) produced by Marvel Studios, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. It follows Kamala Khan, a 16-year-old fangirl of the Avengers who struggles to fit in until she gains her own powers. Ali served as head writer with Adil & Bilall leading the directing team.\n\nIman Vellani stars as Kamala Khan, with Matt Lintz, Yasmeen Fletcher, Zenobia Shroff, Mohan Kapur, Saagar Shaikh, Laurel Marsden, Azhar Usman, Rish Shah, Arian Moayed, Alysia Reiner, Laith Nakli, Nimra Bucha, Travina Springer, Adaku Ononogbo, Samina Ahmad, Fawad Khan, Mehwish Hayat, Farhan Akhtar, and Aramis Knight also starring. The series was announced with Ali's involvement in August 2019. Vellani was cast in September 2020, with Adil & Bilall, Meera Menon, and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy hired as the series' directors. Filming began in early November 2020, shooting in Atlanta, Georgia, and New Jersey, before concluding in Thailand in May 2021.\n\nMs. Marvel premiered on June 8, 2022, and ran for six episodes until July 13. It is part of Phase Four of the MCU. The series received positive reviews, particularly for its creative visual style and Vellani's performance. Ms. Marvel sets up the events of the film The Marvels (2023), in which Vellani reprises her role as Kamala.\n\nKamala Khan, a 16-year-old fangirl of the Avengers, particularly Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel, struggles to fit in until she gains her own powers.[1]\n\nRecurring in the series are Jordan Firstman as school counselor Gabe Wilson,[24][16] and Anjali Bhimani and Sophia Mahmud as Aunties Ruby and Zara.[25][26] Additional guest stars include Ali Alsaleh and Dan Carter as Aadam and Saleem, members of the Clandestines who wield a golden mace and powered whip, respectively;[16] and Vardah Aziz and Asfandyar Khan as Kamala's cousins Zainab and Owais, respectively.[22] Ryan Penagos, vice president and creative executive at Marvel New Media, has a cameo appearance as the cosplay competition host at AvengerCon.[27] Directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah make cameo appearances as a man in the mosque and one of the \"Mosque Bros\", respectively,[28] while Amanat cameos during Aamir and Hillman's wedding,[29] and G. Willow Wilson cameos as herself as a TikTok commentator.[30] Brie Larson makes an uncredited cameo as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel in the series finale's mid-credits scene.[31] A photo of Jameela Jamil as Titania, who stars as the character in the Disney+ series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022), appears in the series; Jamil was unaware of its inclusion in Ms. Marvel until it aired.[32]\n\nMarvel Entertainment's creative consultant Joe Quesada said in September 2016 that there were plans to explore the character of Kamala Khan / Ms. Marvel in other media following her unusually rapid success and popularity among comic book readers.[33] Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said in May 2018 that a Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) project based on Kamala Khan was \"in the works\",[34][35] and would follow the release of the film Captain Marvel (2019) as Kamala is inspired by that film's title character Carol Danvers.[34]\n\nBy August 2019, Marvel Studios had begun development on a Ms. Marvel television series for the streaming service Disney+, with Bisha K. Ali hired to serve as the head writer after working as a writer on the series Loki.[36][37] Ali had approached one of the Marvel Studios executives on Loki, Kevin Wright, while were working on that series to get an opportunity to meet about Ms. Marvel,[37] and she declined an extension to continue working on Loki in order to create her pitch. She believed that Marvel responded to her \"general vibe and energy\" from the pitch, which conveyed to them that a series about Ms. Marvel was very personal to her \"as a fan, as a South Asian person, as a Pakistani woman, [and] as a woman from a Muslim background\".[38] Ms. Marvel was officially announced at the 2019 D23 conference.[39]\n\nIn September 2020, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah (credited as Adil & Bilall[11]: 1 ) were hired to direct two episodes of the series, with Meera Menon hired to direct one episode, and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy hired to direct three;[40][41] Menon and Obaid-Chinoy ultimately directed two episodes each.[11]: 1  Despite their different visual styles and prior work, all of the directors worked closely together to create a \"seamless transition\" between their episodes.[11]: 5  Ali, El Arbi, and Fallah serve as executive producers on the series and worked closely with Marvel Studios to develop it,[42][43] with Kamala Khan co-creator Sana Amanat also serving as an executive producer,[43][11]: 2  alongside Marvel Studios' Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, and Brad Winderbaum.[11]: 2 \n\nIn addition to Ali, writers for the series include Kate Gritmon, Freddy Syborn, A. C. Bradley, Matthew Chauncey, Sabir Pirzada, Fatimah Asghar, and Will Dunn.[44] Bradley and Chauncey were respectively the head writer, and story editor and writer for What If...?,[45][46] joining Ms. Marvel after completing the scripts for What If...? season two,[47]: 23:55–24:05  with Bradley also serving as a consulting producer on Ms. Marvel,[46]: 6  while Pirzada was a writer for Moon Knight.[48] Bradley stated that she \"significantly [rewrote] all episodes\" of the series, which in turn necessitated the WGA to mandate she receive writing credit on three of the episodes. Despite this work, Bradley claimed she was only paid a weekly rate and did not receive script fees.[49] Ali said Amanat's involvement allowed them to \"stay true to the character\" from the comic books while adding \"something new, with a freshness, vitality and contemporary edge\".[50] Ali described her time working on Loki as \"good training ground\" to serve as Ms. Marvel's head writer,[37] learning what creative freedoms Marvel Studios allowed for each series to inhabit their own part of the MCU while still being bounded by the overarching storytelling.[37][38] She was told to keep Kamala's story \"ground level\", which was already part of her plan for the series, and to always focus on who the character represents. Ali received advice from WandaVision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier head writers Jac Schaeffer and Malcolm Spellman.[38]\n\nIn Ms. Marvel, Kamala gains the ability to harness cosmic energy and create hard light constructs from a magical bangle,[3][4] which differs from the shapeshifting abilities that she has in the comics. Feige explained that the Inhuman source of her abilities in the comics did not \"match\" with the timeline and events of the MCU, so her powers were adjusted to be related to her Pakistani heritage. They were also brought closer to the cosmic powers of the other heroes in the film The Marvels (2023), in which Vellani co-stars. Feige added that the character's \"giant hands and arms\" would still appear in the series \"in spirit\".[51] The change to Kamala's powers was not part of Ali's initial pitch and arose as a group decision to align the character with what had been established in the MCU.[50] It was important to the creative team that Kamala's new powers have the \"same connectivity with her psychology and the journey she's going through and the way she sees herself\" as her shapeshifting abilities did in the comics.[8] Amanat and another of the character's co-creators, G. Willow Wilson, were both consulted on and supported the change. Amanat felt it was \"fun to give Kamala different kinds of powers that feel big in scope and cinematic... the essence of what the powers are in the comics is there, both from a metaphorical standpoint and from a visual standpoint.\"[35] The finale episode reveals that Kamala has a genetic \"mutation\", implying that she is a mutant (which is supported by a musical excerpt of the X-Men: The Animated Series theme being played during the reveal).[52][53][30] Vellani confirmed that Kamala was the first mutant in the MCU,[5] and Ali said this explains why other members of her family do not have powers.[54] Amanat and Wilson originally intended for Kamala to be a mutant in the comics.[55]\n\nMs. Marvel is a coming-of-age story that Amanat said would be told \"through the lens of Kamala's experience and her wild imagination\". She described Kamala's life and world as \"naturally colorful\" due to Jersey City being a \"pretty crazy and vibrant and multicultural place\". Carol Danvers is Kamala's inspiration to become a hero after she almost defeated Thanos during the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019). Amanat believed it was important to tell a story about who your heroes are for a young person of color, and exploring what that does to \"your sense of self\".[35] Ali wanted to mix the \"whimsical and magical\" qualities from Ms. Marvel's comics with American high school films, taking specific inspiration from the films of John Hughes as well as 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), Lady Bird (2017), Eighth Grade (2018), Booksmart (2019),[6] and the MCU film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan was another inspiration for the series.[37] Ms. Marvel features a love triangle between Kamala, Bruno Carrelli, and Kamran, which was toned down during the writing process because Ali did not want audiences to believe it was the dominant storyline. El Arbi said it was relatable that Bruno was in the \"friend zone\", and Ali felt this was a \"fundamental part of growing up\".[10]\n\nKamala's family plays a large role in the series, which Ali felt was \"vital\" and a way to differentiate the character within the MCU. She wanted to explore \"what's been passed down to [Kamala] through intergenerational trauma. I wanted to show these four generations of women and show that they are her superpower.\" Kamala's father also gives her the Ms. Marvel name, while her mother helps construct her costume.[56] The partition of India is a major part of the series, and was included from the beginning of development. Ali looked to the film Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), which occurs at the end of World War II, to see how she could tie in the real-life events of the partition to what had been established in the MCU.[57] Priya Satia, a professor at Stanford University and British Empire historian, consulted on the series.[58][59] The writers created \"essays\" about how the Clandestines, the Noor dimension, and the Red Daggers were all connected. Ali explained that much of this was unable to be put into the final version of the series due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other time constraints,[57] with the stories for the Clandestines and the Red Daggers having to be \"truncated\".[56] Kamala and the Clandestines are referred to as Djinn in the series. When some Muslim fans pointed out that the Quran prohibits the worshipping of Djinn, Obaid-Chinoy responded that Djinn was just being used to represent \"anyone who is different, or anyone who has powers\".[60] Ali elaborated that Kamala and the Clandestines were not actually Djinn, but the writers wanted to explore how Kamala would feel about the name due to its negative cultural connotations.[57]\n\nIn September 2020, newcomer Iman Vellani was cast in the lead role.[2] Her aunt had forwarded her a casting call for the role, which led to Vellani submitting a self-tape before being asked to audition at Marvel Studios' offices in Los Angeles.[7] She had an in-person screen test in February 2020, as well as a virtual one over Zoom in June 2020, before landing the role.[61] Set photos in November revealed that Matt Lintz had been cast in the series.[62] The next month, Marvel confirmed that Lintz had been cast,[63] portraying Bruno Carrelli,[9] along with Yasmeen Fletcher as Nakia Bahadir;[12] Zenobia Shroff as Muneeba Khan; Mohan Kapur as Yusuf Khan;[15] Saagar Shaikh as Aamir Khan;[64][16] Azhar Usman as Najaf;[11]: 15  Aramis Knight as Kareem / Red Dagger;[9] Rish Shah as Kamran;[65][66] Travina Springer as Tyesha Hillman; Laith Nakli as Sheikh Abdullah; and Nimra Bucha as Najma.[16]\n\nNewcomer Laurel Marsden was cast in the role of Zoe Zimmer in February 2021,[67] while Alysia Reiner was revealed to have also been cast in the series as Department of Damage Control (DODC) agent Sadie Deever.[68][17] Fawad Khan said he was part of the cast in December 2021,[69] appearing as Hasan,[20] and Mehwish Hayat was reported a month later to also have a role in the series,[70] as Aisha.[21] In March 2022, Adaku Ononogbo was revealed to be cast as Fariha.[71] Arian Moayed was part of the cast by that May,[72][73] reprising his role as DODC agent P. Cleary from Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021),[17] as was Farhan Akhtar in the guest role of Waleed.[74][22] Samina Ahmad appears as Kamala's grandmother Sana, who was named for Amanat.[18]\n\nAlso in February 2021, Alyy Khan revealed that he planned to be a part of the series in Obaid-Chinoy's episodes.[75] In March 2022, Anjali Bhimani was revealed as auntie Ruby,[76][25] a recurring role, after previously appearing in the Marvel Television series Runaways.[76] Jordan Firstman appears as Gabe Wilson, named as an homage to G. Willow Wilson,[24] while Ali Alsaleh and Dan Carter appear as Aadam and Saleem.[16] Vardah Aziz and Asfandyar Khan appear as Kamala's cousins Zainab and Owais, respectively.[22] Brie Larson makes an uncredited cameo appearance as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel in the series finale's mid-credits scene.[31]\n\nArjun Bhasin was the costume designer for the series.[50] Kamala's Ms. Marvel costume was inspired by burkinis and shalwar kameez, with subtle \"cultural details\" in the fabric.[77]: 89  Amanat credited Bhasin for incorporating \"cool textures\" to make the costume feel South Asian in a subtle way, and she noted that the lightning bolt on the costume was updated from the comic version.[50] Christopher Glass was the production designer for the series,[78] while Natasha Gerasimova took over for the series' reshoots.[79] Perception created the end title sequence, using footage of locations in Jersey City mixed with Ms. Marvel-related murals.[80]\n\nEl Arbi and Fallah, Menon, and Obaid-Chinoy directed the series.[40] Filming began in early November 2020 at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia,[81][82] with additional filming at Blackhall Studios and Areu Brothers Studios.[83] The series was filmed under the working title Jersey.[84] Cinematographers were Robrecht Heyvaert for El Arbi and Fallah,[85] Carmen Cabana for Menon,[86] and Jules O'Loughlin for Obaid-Chinoy.[87]\n\nThe animated sequences were not scripted,[85] though an early version of the first episode's script had a moment inside Kamala's head which the directors expanded across the entire series.[8] El Arbi and Fallah conceived them as a way to \"get inside Kamala Khan's head and capture her dream world and fantasy world\",[85] and for viewers to see the world \"through her eyes\".[77]: 88  These moments were a way to translate the vibrancy the directors enjoyed from the comics into the series, and were inspired by the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018).[88] The integration of the animated elements took a lot of planning during pre-production, so the directors could not improvise how those sequences were shot.[88] El Arbi said the other directors enjoyed using these ideas for their episodes as well.[85] The duo were inspired by Spike Lee to make New Jersey a character in the series like Lee does with New York City in his films,[88] and also took inspiration from Steven Spielberg, anime (particularly for the visual effects),[77]: 89  John Hughes's films,[88] the films Booksmart and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010),[77]: 89 [88] the early 1990s television series Parker Lewis Can't Lose and Saved by the Bell, and Adrian Alphona and Jamie McKelvie's art from the Ms. Marvel comics.[88] El Arbi and Fallah concluded filming their episodes on March 5, 2021.[89]\n\nCultural advisors were used to examine the scripts and footage to ensure authenticity.[86] Secondary filming occurred in Hudson County, New Jersey, from March to early April.[83][90] Vellani and Shah continued to film scenes in Atlanta through late April and early May.[66][91] Obaid-Chinoy began filming the fourth and fifth episodes in Thailand by March 23, specifically in Bangkok and at the Studio Park facilities.[92][93] Due to the series' strict COVID-19 protocols, Ms. Marvel was able to obtain a waiver from the Thai government to continue filming in the country throughout April and May 2021 despite new restrictions put in place in April that suspended other film and television productions. The cast and crew of 450 people were divided into three bubbles so production could continue if a positive test was found in one of the bubbles.[92] Thailand stands in for Pakistan in the series, with the production unable to shoot in that country because of its political situation,[94] though some pickup shots were filmed in Karachi.[87] Principal photography concluded in Thailand in early May 2021.[92]\n\nReshoots, with Obaid-Chinoy directing, occurred at the end of January 2022.[95] She said these were mostly pickup material to help clarify story elements and make a cohesive narrative.[96] Conversely, Gerasimova called the reshoots \"pretty massive\" because there was \"quite a big script restructuring, and a lot of episodes were reshuffled\", which resulted in the need to build new sets in Atlanta. This included trying to match with material that was shot in Thailand which Gerasimova said was \"incredibly challenging\".[79] The series finale's mid-credits scene was shot by The Marvels director Nia DaCosta.[97]\n\nEditors on the series include Nona Khodai (episodes one, four, five, and six), Sabrina Plisco (episodes one, three, and six), and Emma McCleave and Sushila Love (episodes two and three).[11]: 28  Visual effects for the series were created by Digital Domain, Framestore, FuseFX, Method Studios, RISE, SSVFX, Trixter, and Perception.[98]\n\nComposer Laura Karpman worked on the score for the series for five months, from February to July 2022. She previously composed for What If...? and had been hired to score The Marvels.[99] Karpman said she immersed herself in Kamala's \"rich musical heritage\",[100] and wanted to give the character \"the kind of dignity and presence of every other major Marvel superhero\" while acknowledging her cultural background. She worked closely with Amanat, who had specific ideas she wanted for the music of the series, while also recommending a violinist to Karpman to achieve certain \"unique sounds\".[99]\n\nApproaching Kamala's theme, Karpman looked to incorporate a traditional orchestra with South Asian musical elements, ensure that it was \"hip, driven by contemporary beats, dhol beats, tabla beats, or both\" since the character was a teenager. The South Asian elements were achieved by a number of artists who played the sarangi, sursringar, bansuri, and mridangam, recording remotely in India and Pakistan, alongside featured soloists, violinist Raaginder and vocalist Ganavya Doraiswamy. Karpman was impressed with the improvisation by these artists, believing those takes had \"the most interesting stuff\" in them over the ones with just the themes she had provided for them to play. These sounds were combined with a 70-piece orchestra that recorded every week at Synchron Stage Vienna, along with other production and processing elements; an eight-voice choir of South Asian singers added for the fifth episode score. Other themes created by Karpman included one for Kamala's bangle and one for her heritage, and a love theme for Aisha and Hasan, among others.[99] Karpman's score was released digitally by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records in two volumes: music from the first three episodes was released on June 22,[101] and music from the last three was released on July 13.[102] Karpman's \"Ms. Marvel Suite\" was released as a single on June 7.[103]\n\nMs. Marvel also features a number of existing songs, with Ali believing music was an integral part of adapting the character to the screen. She credited Amanat for having a strong vision of which songs were needed and should be used. Amanat called Ms. Marvel a \"great platform\" to showcase South Asian music, with the selections being a blend in a similar way to Kamala.[50]\n\nAll music composed by Laura Karpman except where noted.[101][102]\n\nA first look at the series with early footage, testimonials about the impact the character has had, and clips of Vellani's audition was shown at Disney's Investor Day in December 2020. Josh Weiss at Syfy Wire called it \"absolutely priceless\" seeing the exact moment Vellani learned she had been cast as Kamala.[43] Additional footage was shown during Disney+ Day on November 12, 2021.[104][1]\n\nThe first trailer for the series was released on March 15, 2022.[3] Many commentators noted the change to Kamala's powers from the comics (in which she has shape-shifting abilities) to being able to harness cosmic energy and form constructs with magical bangles,[3][105][106][107] believed to be similar to the Nega-Bands from the comics.[108] Linda Codega at Gizmodo said the trailer was \"as adorable, fun, and exciting as the comics[, full] of absolutely excellent directorial decisions\" and that the series looked like \"a tone-perfect mashup of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and Sky High\".[109] Gabrielle Sanchez of The A.V. Club said the trailer offered \"an illustrative guide to Kamala Khan\".[107] The final shot of the trailer, as well as a teaser poster also released for the series, pays homage to the cover of Ms. Marvel (2014) #5.[15][110]\n\nA Fan's Guide to Ms. Marvel, a documentary short featuring an exclusive look at the production of the series and interviews from the filmmaking team and Vellani, was released on Disney+ on June 1, 2022.[111][73] In January 2021, Marvel announced their \"Marvel Must Haves\" program, which reveals new toys, games, books, apparel, home decor, and other merchandise related to each episode of Ms. Marvel following an episode's release,[112] which started on June 7 and concluded on July 15, 2022.[113][114] QR codes were included in the first four episodes linking viewers to a website to access free digital comics featuring Ms. Marvel that updated weekly;[115][116] this followed a similar program that happened with Moon Knight.[117] The comics released for the episodes, in order, were Ms. Marvel (2014) #1, Ms. Marvel (2014) #15, Magnificent Ms. Marvel (2019) #1, Ms. Marvel (2015) #12,[115] and Ms. Marvel (2014) #19.[116]\n\nMs. Marvel premiered on Disney+ on June 8, 2022,[3] and consisted of six episodes, with episodes being released weekly,[92] concluding on July 13.[118] The red carpet premiere occurred on June 2 at El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles.[119] The series was originally scheduled to debut in late 2021,[63] but following the announcement of Hawkeye premiering in late November 2021, Aaron Couch of The Hollywood Reporter said it was \"unclear\" if Ms. Marvel would also still release in 2021, given Hawkeye would still be releasing into December and it was \"unlikely\" two Marvel Studios series would release at the same time.[120] In August 2021, Matt Webb Mitovich of TVLine felt it was \"very safe to assume\" Ms. Marvel would premiere in early 2022,[121] with it confirmed the following month to be moving to 2022.[122] In November 2021, it was confirmed to be releasing in mid-2022,[1] with the June 2022 premiere confirmed in March 2022.[3] Ms. Marvel is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[123]\n\nThe series received a three-part theatrical release across Pakistan through licenser HKC Entertainment, due to Disney+ not being available in the country at that time. The first two episodes were released on June 16, 2022, followed by the third and fourth episodes on June 30, with the last two episodes released on July 14.[124][125] Ms. Marvel aired on ABC as part of The Wonderful World of Disney, with the first three episodes airing on August 5, 2023, and the final three airing on August 12, 2023. This was done in hopes of allowing an additional opportunity for viewers to see the series and be introduced to Kamala Khan before her appearance in The Marvels later in 2023,[126] as well as to fill programming time for ABC during the 2023 Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes that had shut down production on television series.[127]\n\nWhip Media, which tracks viewership data for the more than 21 million worldwide users of its TV Time app, calculated that Ms. Marvel was the most anticipated new television series for June 2022.[128] According to market research company Parrot Analytics, which looks at consumer engagement in consumer research, streaming, downloads, and on social media, Ms. Marvel had 46.2 times the average series demand in its first month after premiering. It ranked behind Obi-Wan Kenobi and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds in demand for new series premieres in the second quarter of 2022.[129][130] Parrot Analytics reported that the show consistently saw an increase in-demand each week of its release.[131] In 2022, Ms. Marvel was featured in the Pakistan Google Search Trends list, ranking as one of the most searched television series in the country.[132][133]\n\nPercentage of positive critics' reviews tracked by the website Rotten Tomatoes[134]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 98% approval rating, with an average score of 8.20/10, based on 303 reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Ms. Marvel is a genuinely fresh addition to the MCU—both stylistically and substantively—with Iman Vellani ably powering proceedings with her super-sized charisma.\"[134] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 78 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[135]\n\nThe first two episodes were given to critics to review the series ahead of its premiere,[136] with Destiny Jackson at Empire feeling the series was able to balance the comedic and dramatic moments, with \"witty visual gags and well-rounded, warmly funny, instantly likeable characters\", adding that Ms. Marvel had \"an authentic take on Pakistani-American culture; [...] the show takes admirable care in explaining the rituals and realities of life as a modern Muslim\".[137] Writing for Rolling Stone, Alan Sepinwall commented that the superhero scenes were \"rarely more than functional\" with a lack of energy compared to the more personal ones such as Kamala's \"arguments with her parents, her and Nakia protesting the condition of the gender-segregated parts of the mosque, or her and... Kamran flirting while discussing their favorite Bollywood films\".[138] Variety's Caroline Framke felt Ms. Marvel broke through \"Marvel's typical house style\" with the use of animation throughout to convey Kamala's thoughts and day dreams, calling it a \"tangibly kinetic magic\" and likening it to the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.[139]\n\nVellani's portrayal of Kamala Khan received widespread praise.[140][141][136] IGN's Emma Fraser compared her to Hailee Steinfeld as Kate Bishop in Hawkeye,[140] with Kathryn Porter of Paste adding that Vellani \"shines\" in the role and that there was \"no way to explain how great she is in this other than to say that she embodies the true spirit of Kamala Khan\".[141] Mohammad Zaheer at BBC Culture called Vellani \"an adorable bundle of charisma\" in a role \"tailor-made for her\", likening her to Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter film series.[142]\n\nThe changes to Kamala's powers from the comics was also highlighted,[143][141][138][144] albeit with a mixed reception. While the new origin's more personal connection was praised,[145][139][146] the powers themselves drew criticism: Sepinwall called these abilities \"more generic\" than the comics powers;[138] Charles Pulliam-Moore at The Verge wrote that the live-action abilities \"are only able to approximate the flashy aspects of what was originally a nuanced metaphor in the comics. [...] But the show doesn't go nearly as far with its hero in terms of using its conceit to explore ideas like internalized racism or the pressures Western (read: white) beauty standards put on people of color\";[144] and Porter pointed out that G. Willow Wilson—one of the character's creators—had previously described that during the development of Kamala's powers, it was chosen not to give her \"sparkly, hand wave-y, floaty, pretty powers\", which Porter felt was \"one of the most important things about her in the comics, and losing that in favor of powers that are, in fact, sparkly, hand wave-y, floaty, and pretty is really unfortunate\".[141]\n\nActivist Malala Yousafzai praised the series for its reflection of Pakistani people,[147] and was \"struck by how familiar Kamala Khan's life seemed to me\", saying the series was \"for every young person finding their place in the world\".[148] The series was anticipated by Muslims in Jersey City, New Jersey, with councilman Yousef Saleh calling Ms. Marvel a \"critical point in TV culture\" since it would feature Muslims portrayed as heroes rather than villains as is more commonly done, and he was excited about the presence of a Muslim Marvel superhero to \"inspire the next generation\". McNair Academic High School in the city features a club called Coles Kamala Korps, which was launched in 2022 in response to anticipation for the series and The Marvels, after informally focusing on the character previously.[149]\n\nAfter the release of the first episode, the series was review bombed on IMDb with a high amount of 1 star ratings. Multiple reviews were also posted with some reviewers expressing distaste for the family friendly aspects of the series or the change of Kamala's powers, while others called the series \"woke\", mentioning Captain Marvel.[150][151]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced. The specials go behind the scenes of the making of the MCU films and television series with cast members and additional creatives.[161] The special of this series, \"The Making of Ms. Marvel\", featuring Vellani, was released on Disney+ on August 3, 2022.[162][163]\n\nDuring the series' official announcement at D23, Feige stated that after introducing Ms. Marvel in the series, the character would cross over to the MCU films,[39] which he reiterated in November 2019.[164] Previously, Captain Marvel star Brie Larson expressed interest in including Ms. Marvel in that film's sequel,[165] and Vellani was confirmed to be appearing in the Captain Marvel sequel, The Marvels, in December 2020.[166][167] In February 2021, Feige stated that Ms. Marvel would set up the events of The Marvels.[168] The film was not fully conceived by the time Ali started working on the series, so she had a lot of creative freedom in crafting the series but knew there needed to be a \"maturity\" across Kamala's character arc so she would be ready for the events of The Marvels.[8] Shaikh, Shroff, and Kapur reprise their roles as Khan's family members in The Marvels.[169]\n\nIn September 2023, Ali and El Arbi said a decision regarding a potential second season would be made following the release of The Marvels.[170] In December 2023, Vellani expressed interest in having Doc.X serve as the villain in a second season, since it would \"resonate with the Gen Z audience\",[171] and was also hopeful her and Pirzada's Ms. Marvel comic books, which retconned the character as a mutant in the main Marvel Comics continuity, would eventually be adapted within the MCU.[172]\n"

        "content": "\n\nShe-Hulk: Attorney at Law is an American television miniseries created by Jessica Gao for the streaming service Disney+, based on Marvel Comics featuring the character She-Hulk. It is the eighth television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) produced by Marvel Studios, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. It follows Jennifer Walters, a lawyer specializing in cases involving superhumans who also becomes the green superhero She-Hulk. Gao served as head writer and Kat Coiro led the directing team.\n\nTatiana Maslany stars as Jennifer Walters / She-Hulk alongside Jameela Jamil, Ginger Gonzaga, Mark Ruffalo, Josh Segarra, Mark Linn-Baker, Tess Malis Kincaid, Tim Roth, Megan Thee Stallion, Benedict Wong, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Jon Bass, Rhys Coiro, Griffin Matthews, Patti Harrison, Steve Coulter, Charlie Cox, Brandon Stanley, and Drew Matthews. She-Hulk was announced in August 2019 and Gao was hired that November. Coiro joined to direct multiple episodes in September 2020. In December, Maslany's casting was officially announced and Anu Valia was hired to direct multiple episodes. Filming took place in Atlanta, Georgia, from April to August 2021.\n\nShe-Hulk: Attorney at Law premiered on August 18, 2022, and ran for nine episodes until October 13. It is the last television series of Phase Four in the MCU. The series received generally positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Maslany's performance, though reception to the series' visual effects was mixed.\n\nJennifer Walters has a complicated life as a single attorney in her 30s who also becomes the 6-foot-7-inch (2.01-meter) green superhero She-Hulk.[1]\n\nGuest stars include Nicholas Cirillo as Ched, Walters' cousin,[24] Peg O'Keef as Runa, a shape-shifting Light Elf from New Asgard who defrauded Bukowski by impersonating Megan Thee Stallion,[42] Patty Guggenheim as Madisynn King, a drunken victim of Blaze's magic who becomes Wong's friend,[43] Leon Lamar as Cornelius P. Willows, Blaze's sidekick and the curator of Mystic Castle,[32] David Otunga as Derek, one of Walters' dates,[44] and Trevor Salter as Josh Miller, a member of Intelligencia who dates Walters in order to steal a sample of her blood for Phelps.[45][46] Brian T. Delaney provides the uncredited voice of K.E.V.I.N. (Knowledge Enhanced Visual Interconnectivity Nexus),[47] an artificial intelligence in charge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's story decisions; the character is a reference to Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige.[48] Feige was asked to voice K.E.V.I.N., but he declined.[49] Gao and fellow series' writers Zeb Wells and Cody Ziglar have cameo appearances in the season.[50]\n\nComic characters introduced in the series include: the Wrecking Crew, a four-man criminal group wielding stolen enhanced Asgardian construction tools as weapons with its members including Nick Gomez as Wrecker and Justin Eaton as Thunderball;[51] David Pasquesi as Craig Hollis / Mr. Immortal, a superhuman incapable of dying who goes to GLK&H to help him settle the divorces of his many spouses;[52] Nathan Hurd as Man-Bull, a human/cattle hybrid who gained his appearance from a science experiment gone wrong; Joseph Castillo-Midyett as El Águila, a self-proclaimed swashbuckler who is capable of generating electrical blasts through objects; Terrence Clowe as Saracen, a man who claims that he is a Vampire; Jordan Aaron Ford as Porcupine, an individual who continually wears a costume reminiscent of a porcupine;[25][53] and Wil Deusner provides motion-capture for Skaar, Banner's son from Sakaar who also inherited his Hulk powers.[54]\n\nBy July 1989, the character Jennifer Walters / She-Hulk was expected to appear in the television film The Death of the Incredible Hulk (1990).[55][56] The character ultimately did not appear, and a proposed television series featuring She-Hulk at ABC was canceled a year later.[56][57] In 1991, a film based on the character entered development at New World Pictures with Larry Cohen serving as director, and Brigitte Nielsen set to play She-Hulk.[56][57][58] Nielsen participated in a promotional photoshoot, but the film ultimately did not materialize.[56][59]\n\nIn August 2019, Marvel Studios announced at the D23 conference that a She-Hulk television series was being developed for the streaming service Disney+, to be set in their shared universe the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).[60] Shortly after, Jessica Gao was approached to pitch for the series.[61] Gao had previously met with Marvel Studios to pitch for the films Captain Marvel (2019), Black Widow (2021), and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021),[62] and had expressed her desire to be approached about a potential She-Hulk project each time. She was one of the first creatives to include the character in her pitches to the studio,[7]: 32  doing so in her Black Widow one, which Marvel Studios executive Brad Winderbaum felt was more of a She-Hulk film featuring Black Widow than a pitch for a Black Widow film.[63] Gao said her past pitches had allowed her to build a relationship with Marvel Studios, so by the time she pitched for She-Hulk Feige and the other executives knew the type of writer she was, her humor, and \"the quirks and nuances\" she put into her scripts.[62] Her pitch for She-Hulk included the characters Bruce Banner and Emil Blonsky / Abomination, though she was unsure if they would be able to appear, including an extended trial plot for Blonsky.[63] Gao also included the Leader in her pitch and suggested that they either bring back the Samuel Sterns version of the character, who was portrayed by Tim Blake Nelson in The Incredible Hulk (2008), or create a new version that could have been related to Sterns; the Leader ultimately did not appear, and Gao could not remember whether this was a writing choice or if Marvel Studios did not allow the series to use the character.[64] Gao was hired to serve as the head writer for She-Hulk in November 2019.[65]\n\nIn September 2020, Kat Coiro was hired to direct the first and final episodes plus four others, and to executive produce the series,[66][67] while Anu Valia had also joined as a director by December 2020.[23] Valia said she was directing a few episodes of the series and described Coiro as the series' \"visionary leader\".[67] She hoped by joining the series that she would be able to add to what Gao and Coiro had created and find her \"own personal connection to the story\".[68] Coiro ultimately directed six episodes and Valia directed three.[69] In May 2022, Marvel Studios announced that the series would be titled She-Hulk: Attorney at Law.[1] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige decided to change the name after hearing Banner's line \"She-Hulk attorney at law, it's got a nice ring to it\" while editing the series and feeling that it would be a \"great title for a show\".[70] Alternate titles for some episodes are displayed during the opening credits: She-Hulk: Attorney for Hire in the second episode,[71] She-Hulk by Titania in the fifth,[72] Just Jen: Attorney at Law in the sixth,[73] and The Savage She-Hulk in the ninth.[74]\n\nThe series was originally announced as consisting of ten episodes, and Feige said these would equal approximately six hours of content.[75][76] This was changed to nine episodes during development due to the natural progression of the story, and Coiro praised Marvel for having the flexibility to change the episode count as needed.[77] Marvel Studios' Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, and Winderbaum served as executive producers on the series along with Coiro and Gao.[1] She-Hulk: Attorney at Law reportedly had a budget of $225 million,[78] giving each episode a $25 million budget.[79]\n\nFrancesca Gailes, Jacqueline J. Gailes, Melissa Hunter, Dana Schwartz, Kara Brown, Zeb Wells, and Cody Ziglar serve as writers on the series,[80] many of whom come from a sitcom background.[6] Francesca Gailes also serves as story editor.[81] Wells and Ziglar contributed their knowledge of comics to the series, such as Wells suggesting the lesser-known villains who appear in his episode, \"The Retreat\".[25] Writing began in 2019,[82] and by early May 2020, work on the series' scripts had ended.[83] Feige described the series as a \"half-hour legal comedy\" that would be faithful to John Byrne's take on She-Hulk in Marvel Comics,[84][85] with star Tatiana Maslany calling it \"this really absurd take on a legal show\".[3] Gao added that She-Hulk: Attorney at Law was \"threading a fine line\" of being a sitcom while still existing within the MCU, likening it to the series Ally McBeal,[6] though that series was not a major influence for the writers given many were not in the right age demographic to have experienced that series when it was originally airing.[63] Gao said it was \"tricky\" balancing tone of the series between the comedic and meta elements with the expected action and drama being within the MCU.[86] Other influences were Legally Blonde (2001) and the series Seinfeld (1989–1998) and The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story (2016).[4][63] The series adapts a \"case of the week\" procedural format while still featuring some serialized elements that contribute to the season arc; Gao implemented this format due to her wanting the audience to enjoy each episode as a complete story.[87]\n\nThe various comic series featuring the character from Stan Lee, Byrne, Dan Slott, and Charles Soule are referenced in Attorney at Law,[30] with Gao \"cherry-pick[ing]\" various elements from each and \"fus[ing] it all together so that it really felt simultaneously like a culmination, but also completely its own thing\";[7]: 33 [63] most of the series draws from the storyline of Slott's run with elements from Byrne's.[88] Soule, who has a legal background and is also an attorney, served as the series' legal consultant, provide advice on aspects such has how lawyers and judges would behave in a courtroom.[89]\n\nThe series incorporates Jennifer Walters' self-awareness and meta nature from the comics,[7]: 33 [90] with Walters gaining the awareness and ability to break the fourth wall in the series following her becoming a Hulk.[91] Coiro said there were \"some big surprises\" regarding the fourth-wall breaking, with Valia adding it was \"very fun, very cool\", and Maslany saying it was a good mechanism to \"bring the audience in\" to the story.[92] Gao, Coiro, and the writers discussed how much of the meta nature should be featured, discussing options such as would she talk to the camera, directly to the audience, or another person \"more behind the scenes\", and if there was another meta element.[90] Initially Walters was constantly breaking the fourth wall, which Marvel Studios felt was too much,[63] resulting in the writers being asked to do a version with editors' notes, a tool used in the comics to clarify story elements, appearing for Walters to interact with.[63][90] The editor's notes were ultimately scrapped for her just breaking the fourth wall, but not to the extent that was originally conceived. Gao's initial pitch for the series had included Fleabag (2016–2019) and Better Call Saul (2015–2022) as references for how to portray Walters breaking the fourth wall,[63] with Maslany believing the Attorney at Law scripts drew from Fleabag's \"irreverence and sense of humor\".[93] The fourth-wall breaks culminated in the final episode of the season, with Walters entering the real world and confronting K.E.V.I.N. (Knowledge Enhanced Visual Interconnectivity Nexus) at Marvel Studios; this was heavily inspired by what Byrne did in his comics run.[94]\n\nThe series takes a \"high-concept, extraordinary idea\" that becomes grounded in Walters' life,[7]: 32–33  with Gao interested in exploring \"that little slice of life\" outside the normal huge scale and action of the MCU.[86] Including Walters' family helped keep the series \"intimate and centered on\" her life, with Gao interested in exploring the family dynamic when a Hulk exists in that family and then a second one gets added to it.[6] With the series also exploring dating for a modern woman, Maslany enjoyed how Walters' dating life \"was just as much of a stress as potentially becoming one of the Avengers\".[93] Having a majority of women on the writing staff allowed them to take their different points of view to create a \"well-rounded female perspective\" in the series and discuss what it was like to be a woman, and what that meant if they became a public superhero. Gao explained that \"a lot of commonalities and a lot of themes emerge[d]\" that the writers were able to put into the series.[70] Gao crafted a season arc for Walters' about accepting her new life as She-Hulk,[95] describing the season as the character's \"origin story\", which allowed her in future appearances to be \"so much more confident\".[96] The series addresses and incorporates many real-life misogynistic and Internet troll comments made about Marvel and female superheroes. Gao called these comments \"very tired and unoriginal\" given the writers were able to \"predict\" what the reaction to the series would be when they started writing in 2019.[82]\n\nAttorney at Law is set \"a relatively short amount of time\" after Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings in the MCU.[97] Gao avoided discussing the Blip given other films and series have \"already covered that territory\" and the events have been accepted and people of the MCU are moving on.[70] The first four episodes and the final episode feature mid-credits scenes.[98][99] They were derived from Gao's love of end credit scenes, not just within the MCU, since they reward audience's patience and are \"like an extra special little treat\". Additionally, it allowed the writers to include more jokes into the episodes.[18] An original pitch for these scenes was to have them be a \"running plot with bad guys\".[100]\n\nMark Ruffalo, who portrayed Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, said in November 2019 that he planned to meet with Feige about making an appearance in the series.[101] In March 2020, Ruffalo confirmed that he was in talks to reprise his role in the series.[102] That September, Deadline Hollywood reported that Tatiana Maslany had been cast in the lead role of Walters,[103] but Maslany denied being cast and said the report was \"a press release that's gotten out of hand\" and \"not actually a thing\".[104] The Hollywood Reporter reaffirmed Maslany's casting in November 2020,[105] and Feige officially confirmed it the next month.[23] Maslany was initially hesitant to join large-scale or franchise projects given her desire to perform in ones \"focused on character\" and tended to \"guarantee\" collaboration. Deciding to audition to the role, Maslany enjoyed Gao's script and was excited by the challenge the role could bring to her and believed it would bring \"a little bit of a shift\" in her life. She later stated she \"flat-out lied\" about denying her casting as she was unsure what she was allowed to say.[106] Feige also confirmed in December 2020 Ruffalo's involvement and the casting of Tim Roth in the series.[23] Ruffalo was reported to have a \"small role\" in the series.[107] Roth reprises his role as Emil Blonsky / Abomination from The Incredible Hulk.[23] Marvel Studios approached Roth to appear in the series after he returned to provide vocal work for the Abomination in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, and the role in the series appealed to Roth's \"anarchy\" within himself and having his career \"being chaos\".[26]\n\nIn January 2021, Ginger Gonzaga was cast as Nikki Ramos, Walters' best friend,[2][108] and Renée Elise Goldsberry was cast that April as Mallory Book.[109][110] Jameela Jamil was cast in June 2021 as Titania,[111] with Josh Segarra joining the following month as Augustus \"Pug\" Pugliese.[2][112] In May 2022, Benedict Wong was revealed to be reprising his MCU role as Wong,[1] while Jon Bass was revealed to be part of the cast as Todd Phelps.[1][31] Nicholas Cirillo,[113] David Otunga,[114] and Griffin Matthews were revealed to be part of the cast in May 2022.[115] That July, Drew Matthews was revealed to be playing Dennis Bukowski.[116] The following month, Mark Linn-Baker was revealed to be playing Morris Walters,[24] Patty Guggenheim was revealed as Madisynn King,[43][117] and Rhys Coiro, Kat's husband, was revealed as Donny Blaze.[118] In August, Megan Thee Stallion was revealed to have a cameo appearance in the series as herself.[27] Her inclusion in the series was suggested by Jamil, after the two had worked together on the television series Legendary.[28]\n\nFeige also teased appearances from other MCU characters given Walters' work as a lawyer for superheroes,[23] with Maslany confirming there would be \"some really fun characters\" in the series that Walters was defending or going up against in court.[3] The majority of the cameos in the series are characters from the comics that have yet to appear in the MCU.[119] Charlie Cox was revealed to be appearing in the series in his MCU role of Matt Murdock / Daredevil in July 2022,[36] which Coiro called the series' \"biggest surprise\".[119] He had been approached by Feige in June 2020 to reprise his role from Marvel's Netflix television series for this and the film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021).[120] In August 2022, Brandon Stanley was revealed as Eugene Patilio / Leap-Frog.[121] Nick Gomez and Justin Eaton appear as Wrecker and Thunderball, respectively, members of the Wrecking Crew,[51] while David Pasquesi appears as Craig Hollis / Mr. Immortal.[52] Additional characters include Nathan Hurd as Man-Bull, Joseph Castillo-Midyett as El Águila, Terrence Clowe as Saracen, and Jordan Aaron Ford as Porcupine.[53] Wil Deusner provides motion-capture for Skaar, Hulk's son.[54] Gao was unaware if Marvel Studios planned to have Deusner remain in the role for Skaar's future appearances.[122]\n\nAnn Foley served as the costume designer, after previously working on the Marvel Television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013–2020).[123] Gonzaga provided input into Nikki's wardrobe since she enjoys and knows fashion. She said that Nikki's wardrobe \"can't be too crazy\" given she works in an office, but was able to make it \"cool and edgy\".[14]: 5  Gonzaga felt most comfortable portraying Nikki when she was wearing \"something a little defiant or something that she shouldn't be wearing at work or something that's a little too high fashion\". Additionally, Gonzaga sold some of her own personal clothing to the series to wear as Nikki.[22] Speaking to Titania's look in the series, Jamil said the creatives wanted \"to go for eleven [with] her style and everything about her\", noting her \"hair is so big and her outfits are so extra\". It was important to Jamil that Titania looked \"very fake in every way\", so she wore a padded butt to replicate buttock augmentation and did her own make up to make it seem like Titania had plastic surgery by \"overlining my lips and chiseling down my nose and overdoing my cheekbones\".[17] Daredevil's costume is similar to the red one he wore in Marvel's Netflix series, but with an updated color scheme to include the yellow helmet and accents from the character's debut comics design in Daredevil #1.[124][125] Cox's original suit was used as a reference and for his costume fitting for the one featured in She-Hulk.[120] Marvel Studios had clear intentions as to what his costume would look like for the series.[70] Cox was excited that She-Hulk was using this suit, also understanding the fans and viewers would equally be excited that the character was able to wear that suit.[126] Elena Albanese served as production designer.[32]\n\nThe series' end credits are in the style of courtroom sketches and are drawn by Kagan McLeod, who worked with Aspect on them.[128][127] Jon Berkowitz, creative director at Aspect, stated they had been approached around November 2021 to pitch ideas for the end credits, explaining that the team at Aspect and Marvel Studios were both drawn to exploring the theme of struggling with one's identity. Before settling on the courtroom sketch concept, Aspect envisioned credits that were inside Walters' mind, \"a hallucinatory expression of identity and duality\"; one they called \"Roommates\" that \"got wacky\" and would have used \"vector-y\" 2D animation; and one called \"The Masks We Wear\" that was \"really out-there\" focusing on how Walters' public \"mask\" is her She-Hulk identity. Moving forward with the courtroom sketches, Aspect hoped to show \"the story outside the story\" rather than serving as a recap for the preceding episode. McLeod created 72 individual ink drawings for the credits, sending them to Aspect after doing the ink pass, then a thicker brush pass, and finally with full watercolor and paint. Aspect took the drawings and created 3D animations from them in order to better manipulate the scope and depth of the drawings; a digital paper texture was also added to the sequences. Each episode featured the same 32 drawings at the beginning and end of the credits, with three unique drawings in the middle for each episode. Marvel Studios had originally planned to use the series' marketing logo at the end of the credits sequence that had been created by the agency Buddha Jones which Berkowitz felt would have been a stark change from seeing McLeod's art before. McLeod created a version of the logo in his style that impressed Marvel Studios to feature in the sequence.[127]\n\nFilming began on April 12, 2021, at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia,[129][130] with Coiro and Valia directing episodes of the series,[23] and Florian Ballhaus and Doug Chamberlain serving as cinematographers for Coiro and Valia, respectively.[14]: 1  The series was filmed under the working titles Libra, Clover,[130][131] and Big Lady.[132] Filming was previously expected to begin on July 6, 2020, but was postponed to March 2021,[105][133] due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[130][133][134]\n\nCoiro worked to visually keep the comedy of the series balanced with the expected cinematic scope of the MCU, stating, \"We obviously are exploring themes and we're exploring tone and we're exploring very everyday comedic moments, but we still need it to feel like it's part of the MCU\".[61] Roth initially found it difficult to return to the character but was able to approach the role with more humor after watching and beginning to work alongside Ruffalo.[26][135] Coiro worked to find a balance when portraying sex in the series, without it going \"too far\" or being \"taboo\",[136] while still making it accessible and enjoyable for general audiences. She noted that Maslany felt the sex positivity of the character was \"very important to her\" and was a main contributor to the conversations about the sexualization in the series.[137]\n\nJamil said she would be filming her scenes until the week of August 15,[138] and filming for the series wrapped by that date.[139] During filming, Coiro partnered with the environmental nonprofit Habits of Waste and their \"Lights, Camera, Plastic\" campaign, to avoid featuring single-use plastics on screen when possible and replacing them with reusable and eco-friendly items.[140]\n\nVisual effects for the series were created by Digital Domain, FuseFX, Soho VFX, Trixter, Wētā FX, and Wylie Co.[141] Coiro discussed the digital character of She-Hulk, believing some of the initial negative reactions to it in the marketing was because \"she is so different\" than other digital characters, as she does not have the same \"grisliness, harshness, [or] bulkiness\" as characters like Thanos or Hulk do. She added that the creatives were focused on achieving detail in She-Hulk's facial expressions and her \"nuances of reaction\", and credited Alonso for her \"incredible eye\" in helping to design the character.[142] As well, the creative team focused on strength over aesthetics, studying musculature and woman athletes rather than bodybuilders. Coiro explained, \"So she doesn't have a bodybuilder's physique, but she absolutely has a very strong physique that can justify the actions that she does in the show. I think people expected a bodybuilder and for her to have these big, massive muscles but she looks more like Olympians\".[8]\n\nGao noted that, despite Feige encouraging her and the writers to feature She-Hulk as much as possible in the series, when it came time to start filming, it was requested that some of the scenes with She-Hulk be changed to ones with Walters. She added that \"a lot of things... had to be changed at the last minute\" because of this shift, and even while editing the episodes, a number of shots were cut that featured She-Hulk due to budget constraints.[63] Digital Domain drew inspiration from the ripening of a strawberry when designing Walters' transformation into She-Hulk.[143] A number of final visual effects shots were reportedly added to the series after it had premiered; this was in part because of the rearranging of the character's backstory that originally was scripted to occur at the end of series before being moved up to the first episode in post-production.[79] Jamie Gross, Stacey Schroeder, Zene Baker,[127] and Tim Roche served as editors on the series.[citation needed]\n\nAmie Doherty was revealed to be composing the score for the series in July 2022.[144] Doherty wanted her main theme to work for both Walters in the courtroom, and then be able to transition into \"this big superhero world\" for She-Hulk. The She-Hulk part of the theme Doherty described as \"big and bombastic\" and one that would fit in the \"well-established sound\" of the MCU and found Walters' portion more challenging to fit alongside the MCU sound while still being unique. She watched legal dramas like Ally McBeal, The Good Wife (2009–2016), and The Good Fight (2017–2022) for inspiration. Doherty wanted to bring a \"modern\" sound to her score alongside the orchestra, looking at songs from Megan Thee Stallion, Billie Eilish, and other artists in the top 40. Woodwind instruments were intentionally left out of the score, with Doherty using synths to fill the frequencies they would have provided; brass and strings were also recorded for the score.[145] The score was recorded at Synchron Stage Vienna.[146]\n\nThe score for the series was released digitally by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records in two volumes: music from the first four episodes was released on September 16,[147] and music from the last five episodes was released on October 19.[148] The series' main theme was released as an eponymous single on August 18.[149]\n\nThe first footage of the series debuted on Disney+ Day on November 12, 2021.[151] The teaser ends with Walters saying to the audience, \"Don't make me angry; you wouldn't like me when I'm angry\" alongside Ruffalo as Banner, which is a homage to an episode of the 1970s live-action television series The Incredible Hulk in which Bill Bixby, who portrayed David Banner, says the line; Ruffalo was in a similar pose and costume as Bixby.[152] Feige and Maslany debuted the trailer for the series on May 17, 2022, at Disney's upfront presentation.[69] The trailer was criticized for its visual effects, with many fans online expressing their disappointment.[153] Despite this, Charles Pulliam-Moore of The Verge called it \"simply smashing\" and highlighted the trailer's visual effects, adding that \"the show's clearly going to be Jennifer's to own as she embarks on her own path to heroism\".[154] Zachariah Kelly of Gizmodo Australia felt the trailer \"does not disappoint at all\", calling the scene where She-Hulk cradles \"her Tinder date like a baby... absolutely hilarious\", and enjoyed having more context to the clips first seen in the Disney+ Day footage.[113] Meanwhile, Richard Trenholm and Joan E. Solsman from CNET described the trailer as \"hilarious\" and wrote that it \"sells the playful tone of the upcoming show\".[155] TechRadar's Stephen Lambrechts meanwhile opined that the trailer was faithful to comic book runs of the character, though he acknowledged criticism surrounding the use of visual effects.[156] The trailer was viewed 78 million times in the 24 hours after it was released, which was the second most views for an MCU Disney+ trailer in a 24-hour time-frame, only behind The Falcon and the Winter Soldier's Super Bowl LV trailer.[157]\n\nThe series was promoted at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con with Coiro, Valia, Gao, Maslany, Gonzaga, and Jamil alongside the release of the second trailer.[158][159] Andrew Webster of The Verge felt the trailer had \"more lighthearted tone than the first [one],... [with] some legal drama\".[160] Edidiong Mboho of Collider stated that the trailer set the \"comedic tone mixed with the epic\" of the series.[161] Jacob Sarkisian of Digital Spy found She-Hulk's fourth-wall breaking the \"eye-catching feature of the trailer\".[162] Similarly, Daniel Chin of The Ringer highlighted the \"comedic tone that's true to the fourth-wall-breaking nature of its source material\" of the trailer and felt it revealed more about the plot.[163] A poster also released at Comic-Con featured a hotline number that had a pre-recorded message from Walters describing the services her law firm provided superpowered individuals.[164] An episode of the series Marvel Studios: Legends was released on August 10, 2022, exploring Banner using footage of his MCU film appearances.[165] Disney created an ad on Tinder meant to represent a dating profile for Walters,[166] while a faux commercial for Walters' law firm Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway was released ahead of the series' premiere, which Cameron Bonomolo from ComicBook.com described as a \"Better Call Saul-style advertisement\".[167]\n\nAhead of the release of the second episode, a Twitter account for Titania was created,[168] while a video was released of Jamil in character covering real-world posters for the series on Sunset Boulevard with her own and spray-painting her name on them.[17][168] This was after Titania's brief appearance at the end of the first episode, with Jamil believing there was \"something so iconic\" and \"very desperate\" about someone promoting themselves after such a brief appearance.[169] Jamil also appeared in character in New York City in September 2022 for a L'Officiel party and Kourtney Kardashian's Boohoo fashion show.[17] Jamil chose to make these appearances in character as a way to pay homage to how the series breaks the fourth wall.[16] At that time, a message from Titania appeared on the hotline number replacing the previous one.[170][171] Following the season finale, the hotline number featured a new message from Mallory Book and Pug, advertising the superhuman law services from GLK&H and touting the various famous clients they worked with, such as Megan Thee Stallion, Blonsky, and Wong.[172]\n\nA QR code was included in each episode linking viewers to a website to access free digital comics featuring She-Hulk that updated weekly, a program which was first introduced in Moon Knight. The comics released for the episodes, in order, were Savage She-Hulk #1, She-Hulk (2004) #1,[173][174] Savage She-Hulk #2,[175] West Coast Avengers Annual #4,[176] She-Hulk (2004) #10,[177] West Coast Avengers #46,[178] Tales to Astonish #48,[175] She-Hulk (2014) #9,[179] and Sensational She-Hulk #50.[180] The \"Marvel Must Haves\" merchandise program, which reveals new toys, games, books, apparel, home decor, and other merchandise related to each episode of She-Hulk following an episode's release, started for the episodes on August 19 and concluded on October 15, 2022.[181][182]\n\nShe-Hulk: Attorney at Law held its world premiere at El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on August 15, 2022.[183] The series debuted on Disney+ on August 18, 2022, and consisted of nine episodes,[184] concluding on October 13.[185] It was originally scheduled to debut on Wednesday, August 17 with releases weekly on Wednesdays, before moving to weekly releases on Thursdays.[185][184] It is the final series in Phase Four of the MCU.[186]\n\nWhip Media, which tracks viewership data for the more than 21 million worldwide users of its TV Time app, calculated that She-Hulk: Attorney at Law was the second most-anticipated new series for August 2022.[187] According to market research company Parrot Analytics, which looks at consumer engagement in consumer research, streaming, downloads, and on social media, She-Hulk: Attorney at Law emerged as one of the most in-demand new series in the third quarter of 2022, ranking as the third most in-demand premiere with 30.5 times the average series demand in its first 30 days.[188] Market research company YouGov estimated that She-Hulk: Attorney at Law was the thirteenth most popular new series of 2022, based on its analysis of search volume, streaming behavior, and engagement metrics like Wikipedia views.[189] According to the file-sharing news website TorrentFreak, She-Hulk: Attorney at Law was the ninth most-watched pirated television series of 2022.[190][191]\n\nPercentage of positive critics' reviews tracked by the website Rotten Tomatoes[192]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 77%, with an average score of 6.50/10, based on 613 reviews. The site's critic's consensus states: \"Whether she's fighting bad guys, defending a client, or managing her messy social life, She-Hulk: Attorney at Law passes the bar for bingeworthy viewing\".[192] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 67 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[193]\n\nThe series' first four episodes were reviewed by critics before they debuted.[194] Daniel Fienberg at The Hollywood Reporter called these episodes \"broad, bright and eager to serve the audience with a wink and a nudge\" though lacking \"stakes or a distinctive style\". He felt the series' writing for characters previously seen in more dramatic situations, and the Easter eggs and cameos would be divisive with viewers.[194] Writing for Rolling Stone, Alan Sepinwall said attempting to be a half-hour comedy series produced \"mixed but mostly positive\" results, but believed the series had a harder time distinguishing itself within the MCU than the character's comic series because the MCU had a lighter tone already compared to the other comics being published around She-Hulk's runs, which made the contrast of her comics more apparent. He also noted the MCU was \"drastically less populated\" in regards to characters that could be featured, with Slott having an \"enormous toy box\" in the comics to feature a wide array of characters. Sepinwall said the humor of Attorney at Law was \"softer than what you find in the more overtly ridiculous MCU films like Thor: Ragnarok or Guardians of the Galaxy\" and did not become consistently funny until the fourth episode.[88]\n\nJoelle Monique at TheWrap called the series \"a delightful break from the cutesy family fun and intense heroic introspection\" of the previous Marvel Studios Disney+ series, praising Maslany's performance and noting it was \"incredibly rewarding as a long-time fan of the franchise\" as well as those who enjoy legal television series.[195] Richard Roeper from the Chicago Sun-Times gave the episodes 3 out of 4 stars, praising Maslany and believing She-Hulk: Attorney at Law \"plays like a 21st century take on a 1980s TV show\" and felt like \"one of those 'cameo every week' kind of shows, with gratuitous but entertaining fight sequences sprinkled in between the courtroom antics and the comedic byplay\".[196] The Verge's Charles Pulliam-Moore said the series a \"surprisingly refreshing spin\" on the Marvel Studios Disney+ series, one that felt \"like the precursor to something new yet very familiar\".[197] Arezou Amin of Collider gave the first four episodes an \"A\", saying they were a \"delightful ride\" and was hopeful the final five episodes would be equally charming.[198]\n\nCaroline Framke of Variety said in her review that the series was \"charming enough as it bounces from one hijink to the next, especially in Maslany's capable hands. But between its obligations to the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, a far more limited budget than its film peers, and attempts to infuse Jen's story with dated #girlboss energy, She-Hulk also represents an unsteady balancing act that needs more time than it likely has to settle into its own groove\". She also noted having Walters be able to have more control over She-Hulk than Banner with Hulk because of her daily experiences as a woman keeping her emotions in check was \"an undeniably effective way to make the She-Hulk experience markedly, urgently different from that of\" Hulk's. Framke also called the story's approach to Walters' job and dating life, and the series' costumes, \"several steps out of date\", and wished for a more innovative approach to the fourth-wall breaking, that has become more commonplace in media since Byrne introduced it to the character in the comics back in the 1980s.[199] Giving the series 2.5 stars out of 4, USA Today's Kelly Lawler said She-Hulk: Attorney at Law \"oh-so-close to being a great show, but doesn't fully commit to any of the three or four different shows it's attempting\", wishing it committed better to the legal comedy, with more fourth-wall breaking and the examinations of regular humans in the MCU. Despite this, Lawler felt Walters was \"a very appealing protagonist\", with praise also going to Maslany, and that the series had \"some well-placed humor\", believing if Attorney at Law \"leans into its strengths, it could be a really unique, fun take\" on the MCU.[200] Kirsten Howard from Den of Geek enjoyed that the woman characters were portrayed as \"smart, strong, and girlbossing it\", but, like Framke, added it was \"a rather rote narrative\" that felt \"dated as all hell, [and] speaks to how far behind the MCU is with female superhero representation that it feels the need to catch up in such a lazy and clichéd way\". They also felt the second, third, and fourth episodes were \"too fluffy [and] too hackneyed\", criticizing the comedy, procedural elements, and infrequent fourth-wall breaking that ended up being \"jarring\".[201]\n\nThe response to the series' visual effects were mixed,[194][196][199][200] with some reviewers feeling it was an improvement over what was featured in the trailers,[199] while others called it distracting and entering the uncanny valley.[197][200] Some were critical of it, but believed it did not detract from the series,[88][194][202] with Howard stating some visual effects in the later episodes leaned towards \"Polar Express territory\". Howard also felt it would have been \"a pretty powerful statement on its own\" to have a fully realized She-Hulk character model against the Hulk model.[201]\n\nIn a review of the entire series, Amelia Emberwing from IGN gave She-Hulk: Attorney at Law an 8 out of 10, praising the approach from Gao, Coiro, and Maslany. She enjoyed the humor Gao and the writers were able to find in moments that highlight \"some of the most ridiculous parts of everyday life as a woman\" against the struggle of suddenly gaining superpowers along with the sitcom format and the fourth-wall breaks. However, both the sitcom format and fourth-wall breaks \"fall apart\" in the finale, which was \"unable to reconcile with its tone\" and did not adequately resolve \"the abject humiliation Jen experiences\" in the penultimate episode. Despite this \"little bit of a bobble\" at the end of the series, Emberwing found Attorney at Law to be \"completely fresh to the Marvel Cinematic Universe\", particularly in bringing \"female sexuality front and center\" and its approach to toxic masculinity. Emberwing's colleague Alex Stedman felt Attorney at Law was a successful first sitcom in the MCU, praising Maslany's performance, though feeling the 30 minute runtimes were at times too short, and sometime wishing multiple episodes had been released each week.[203] Polygon's Matt Patches called the series \"easily one of the horniest shows currently streaming on Disney Plus, and for that, one of the most refreshing\".[137] Debiparna Chakraborty at MovieWeb said Attorney at Law was \"a feminist satire, an origin story, and an overall fun show that manages to break away from many regular MCU tropes\", enjoying the fact the series set a clear tone early on and Walters' ability to break the fourth wall.[204]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced. The specials go behind the scenes of the MCU films and television series with cast members and additional creatives.[216] The special of this series, \"The Making of She-Hulk: Attorney at Law\", was released on Disney+ on November 3, 2022.[217]\n\nIn November 2019, Feige stated that after She-Hulk was introduced in the series, the character would cross over to the MCU films.[218] In February 2021, he said some of Marvel Studios' series, including She-Hulk and Moon Knight (2022), were being developed with the potential to have additional seasons made, in contrast to series like WandaVision (2021) which were developed as limited events that led into feature films.[219] Coiro echoed this in August 2022, saying the series could get a second season or the character could appear in films.[8] Gao had an idea for a second season but focused on telling a complete story with the first. She was hopeful that this as well as material cut from the first season would be able to be used in future projects.[18]\n\nIn January 2024, Maslany said a second season was unlikely, stating, \"I think we blew our budget, and Disney was like 'No thanks!'\".[220] io9 contextualized Maslany's comments noting how Disney CEO Bob Iger's return to the company in November 2022 brought a reevaluation to the company's content output, including Marvel Studios'.[220][221] They stated: \"while Marvel works everything out, it’s not that a second season of She-Hulk has been completely abandoned. It just seems less likely than not at the moment\", though agreed with Maslany that, because of its large budget, the series would need \"major changes\" with its visual effects to become more cost-effective.[220]\n"

        "content": "\n\nSecret Invasion is an American television miniseries created by Kyle Bradstreet for the streaming service Disney+, based on the 2008 Marvel Comics storyline of the same name. It is the ninth television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) produced by Marvel Studios, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. It follows Nick Fury and Talos as they uncover a conspiracy by a group of shapeshifting Skrulls to conquer Earth. Bradstreet serves as the head writer, with Ali Selim directing.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn reprise their respective roles as Fury and Talos from previous MCU media, with Kingsley Ben-Adir, Killian Scott, Samuel Adewunmi, Dermot Mulroney, Richard Dormer, Emilia Clarke, Olivia Colman, Don Cheadle, Charlayne Woodard, Christopher McDonald, and Katie Finneran also starring. Development on the series began by September 2020, with Bradstreet and Jackson attached. The title and premise of the series, along with Mendelsohn's return, were revealed that December. Additional casting occurred throughout March and April 2021, followed by the hiring of Selim and Thomas Bezucha that May to direct the series. Filming began in London by September 2021 and wrapped in late April 2022, with additional filming around England. During production, much of the series' creative team was replaced, with Brian Tucker taking over as writer from Bradstreet and Bezucha exiting, and extensive reshoots took place from mid-June to late September 2022.\n\nSecret Invasion premiered on June 21, 2023, and ran for six episodes until July 26. It is the first series in Phase Five of the MCU. The series received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Jackson's and Mendelsohn's performances but criticized the writing (particularly that of the finale), pacing, and visual effects.\n\nNick Fury works with Talos, a shapeshifting alien Skrull, to uncover a conspiracy by a group of renegade Skrulls led by Gravik who plan to gain control of Earth by posing as different humans around the world.[3][4]\n\nReprising their MCU roles are Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill,[28] Martin Freeman as Everett K. Ross,[29] and O-T Fagbenle as Rick Mason.[30] The first episode reveals that Ross had been replaced by a Skrull infiltrator,[26] and also features Hill's death. Smulders had been aware of the character's death during her initial discussions to join the series.[31] Tony Curran appears as Derrik Weatherby, the director of MI6 who was replaced by a Skrull.[14][32] Curran previously portrayed Bor in Thor: The Dark World (2013) and Finn Cooley in the second season of Daredevil (2016).[32] Also appearing are Ben Peel as Brogan, a rebel Skrull who is tortured by Falsworth;[33] Seeta Indrani as Shirley Sagar, Christopher Goh as Jack Hyuk-Bin, Giampiero Judica as NATO Secretary General Sergio Caspani, and Anna Madeley as the UK prime minister Pamela Lawton, all members of the Skrull Council;[25][26] Juliet Stevenson as Maria Hill's mother Elizabeth;[34] and Charlotte Baker and Kate Braithwaite as Soren, the wife of Talos and mother of G'iah who was killed by Gravik; Baker portrays Soren's human disguise while Braithwaite portrays her Skrull appearance.[13] Soren was previously portrayed by Sharon Blynn in Captain Marvel and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019).[35] Carmen Ejogo was cast in a role, but she ultimately did not appear.[36]\n\nIn September 2020, Kyle Bradstreet was revealed to be developing a television series for the streaming service Disney+ centered on the Marvel Comics character Nick Fury.[5] The character had previously been one of ten properties announced in September 2005 by Marvel Entertainment chairman and CEO Avi Arad as being developed for film by the newly formed studio Marvel Studios, after Marvel received financing to produce the slate of films to be distributed by Paramount Pictures;[37] Andrew W. Marlowe was hired to write a script for a Nick Fury film in April 2006.[38] In April 2019, after Samuel L. Jackson had portrayed Nick Fury in ten Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films as well as the Marvel Television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Richard Newby from The Hollywood Reporter felt it was time the character received his own film, calling the character \"the MCU's most powerful asset yet to be fully untapped\".[39] Jackson was attached to reprise his role in Bradstreet's series, with the latter writing and serving as executive producer.[5]\n\nIn December 2020, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige officially announced a new series titled Secret Invasion, with Jackson co-starring with Ben Mendelsohn in his MCU role of Talos. The series is based on the 2008–09 comic book storyline of the same name,[9] with Feige describing it as a \"crossover event series\" that would tie-in with future MCU films;[40][41] the series' official premise further described it as a crossover event series.[42] Marvel Studios chose to make a Secret Invasion series instead of a film because it allowed them to do something different than they had done before.[43] Bradstreet had worked on scripts for the series for about a year, before he was replaced with Brian Tucker.[44] Directors were being lined up by April 2021.[45] Thomas Bezucha and Ali Selim were attached to direct the series a month later,[46] with each expected to direct three episodes and work on the story.[44] However, Bezucha left the series during production because of scheduling conflicts with reshoots,[47][44] and Selim ultimately directed all six episodes.[4][12] The series reportedly went through multiple issues during pre-production, which necessitated Marvel Studios' executive Jonathan Schwartz becoming more involved with the series to get it \"back on track\" as it had fallen behind schedule and risked some actors becoming unavailable due to other commitments.[44] The episodes were described as being an hour-long each,[8] with the series ultimately totaling approximately 4.5 hours.[48] Marvel Studios' Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Brad Winderbaum, and Schwartz served as executive producers on the series alongside Jackson, Selim, Bradstreet, and Tucker.[4] The budget for the series was $211.6 million.[2] This was noted for being a large budget compared to the content in the series, which did not use large action set pieces or extensive visual effects.[48] Extensive reshoots were believed to partially be the reason for the large budget.[2]\n\nBradstreet, Tucker, Brant Englestein, Roxanne Paredes,[49] and Michael Bhim served as writers on the series.[50] Tucker received the majority of writing credits on the episodes.[51][49] Feige said the series would not be looking to match the scope of the Secret Invasion comic book storyline, in terms of the number of characters featured or the impact on the wider universe, considering the comic book featured more characters than the crossover film Avengers: Endgame (2019).[52] Instead, he described Secret Invasion as a showcase for Jackson and Mendelsohn that would explore the political paranoia elements of the Secret Invasion comic series \"that was great with the twists and turns that that took\".[43][52] The creatives were also inspired by the Cold War-era espionage novels of John le Carré, the television series Homeland (2011–2020) and The Americans (2013–2018),[3] and the film The Third Man (1949). Selim said the series transitions at times between espionage noir and a Western, highlighting the film The Searchers (1956) as a Western inspiration.[12] Feige said the series would serve as a present-day follow-up to the 1990s story of Captain Marvel (2019), alongside that film's sequel The Marvels (2023), but was tonally different from the films.[53][4] Jackson said the series would uncover some of the things that happened during the Blip.[7] Cobie Smulders described the series as \"a very grounded, on-this-earth drama\" that was \"dealing with real human issues and dealing with trust\".[54]\n\nDiscussing the Skrulls, shapeshifting green-skinned extraterrestrials who can perfectly simulate any human being at will, Jackson felt their inclusion introduced \"a political aspect\" in that their ability to shape-shift makes people question who can be trusted and \"What happens when people get afraid and don't understand other people? You can't tell who's innocent and who's guilty in this particular instance.\"[3] The first episode reveals that Everett K. Ross had been replaced by a Skrull infiltrator,[26] while the fourth episode reveals that James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes has been replaced by the Skrull Raava.[20][21] Feige explained that the creators chose Rhodes to be a Skrull because they were looking for an established MCU character viewers would not be expecting to be a Skrull, and to introduce a new experience for viewers rewatching his past MCU appearances and questioning if he was a Skrull during them. They approached actor Don Cheadle during early development of the series about this, who liked the opportunity to be able to \"play with different sides of Rhodey that we haven't seen before\".[20] It is revealed that Rhodes had been replaced by a Skrull \"for a long time\" and is seen wearing a hospital gown when being released from his containment pod.[22] This was interpreted by some to mean he had been replaced after the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016),[22][55][56] a theory which Selim acknowledged, though he would not confirm this specifically,[55][56] saying \"does it have to be definitive, or is it more fun for the audience to go back and revisit every moment\" since Civil War to question whether Rhodes was a Skrull or not.[56]\n\nJackson was expected to reprise his role in the series with the reveal of its development in September 2020.[5] When the series was officially announced that December, Feige confirmed Jackson's casting and announced that Mendelsohn would co-star.[9] Kingsley Ben-Adir was cast as the Skrull Gravik, the \"lead villain\" role, in March 2021,[57][3] and the following month, Olivia Colman was cast as Sonya Falsworth,[58][18] along with Emilia Clarke as Talos's daughter G'iah,[59][3] and Killian Scott as Gravik's second-in-command Pagon.[59][60][11] In May 2021, Christopher McDonald joined the cast as newscaster Chris Stearns, a newly created character rather than one from the comics, who had the potential to appear in other MCU series and films.[60][25] Carmen Ejogo had joined the cast by November 2021 (although she ultimately did not appear in the series),[36] and the next month, Smulders was set to reprise her MCU role as Maria Hill.[28] In February 2022, set photos revealed that Don Cheadle would appear in his MCU role of James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes, along with Dermot Mulroney as United States President Ritson.[61][62][63][15] The following month, Jackson confirmed that Martin Freeman and Cheadle would appear in the series, with Freeman reprising his MCU role as Everett K. Ross.[29][64] In September 2022, it was revealed that Charlayne Woodard was cast in the series as Fury's Skrull wife Priscilla.[65][23]\n\nSamuel Adewunmi and Katie Finneran were revealed as part of the cast in March 2023,[4] with Adewunmi as the Skrull Beto and Finneran as the scientist Rosa Dalton.[14][27] Richard Dormer appears as Agent Prescod,[16] while O-T Fagbenle reprises his Black Widow (2021) role as Rick Mason.[30]\n\nFrank Walsh serves as production designer, while Claire Anderson serves as costume designer.[66] In Secret Invasion, Fury does not wear his signature eyepatch, which Jackson noted was a character choice. He explained, \"The patch is part of who the strong Nick Fury was. It's part of his vulnerability now. You can look at it and see he's not this perfectly indestructible person. He doesn't feel like that guy.\"[3]\n\nThe opening title sequence was created by Method Studios using generative artificial intelligence, which prompted significant backlash online. Some commentators felt this was particularly poor timing given the series was released during the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike for which the use of artificial intelligence over real people was a key issue, with language about protecting writers against the use of AI in the writing process.[67][68][69] Method Studios issued a statement in response to criticism stating that none of their artists had been replaced with artificial intelligence for the sequence and that the technology, both existing and custom-built for this series, was just one tool that their team used to achieve a specific final look. The statement elaborated that many elements in the sequence were created using traditional tools and techniques, and the artificial intelligence technology was just used to add an \"otherworldly and alien look\" which the creative team felt \"perfectly aligned with the project's overall theme and the desired aesthetic\".[70] Storyboard artists and animators on the series expressed disappointment in the opening sequence being generated by A.I.[71]\n\nFilming had begun by September 1, 2021, in London,[72] under the working title Jambalaya,[73][74] with Selim directing the series,[4] and Remi Adefarasin serving as cinematographer.[66] Filming was previously expected to begin in mid-August 2021.[75] Jackson began filming his scenes on October 14,[76] after already working on The Marvels which was filming in London at the same time.[77] Filming occurred in West Yorkshire, England, including Leeds on January 22,[78] Huddersfield on January 24,[79] and in Halifax at Piece Hall from January 24 to 31, 2022.[74] Filming occurred at the Liverpool Street station on February 28, 2022.[61][62][63] Soundstage work occurred at Pinewood Studios on seven of its stages,[80] as well as Hallmark House,[81] and Versa Studios.[82] Filming wrapped on April 25, 2022.[83] Additional filming occurred in London's Brixton neighborhood,[2] and was also expected to occur across Europe.[45]\n\nIn mid-2022, factions of the crew and the series' creative leaders experienced disagreements which \"debilitated\" the production.[44] Jackson revealed in mid-June 2022 that he would return to London in August to work on reshoots for Secret Invasion, after doing the same for The Marvels.[84] McDonald was returning to London by the end of July for the reshoots, which he said were to make the series \"better\" and to go \"much deeper than before\". He also indicated that a new writer was brought on to the production to work on the additional material.[85] Jackson completed his reshoots by August 12, 2022,[86] while Clarke filmed scenes in London at the end of September.[87] By early September, many crew members on the series had been replaced, while co-executive producer Chris Gary, the Marvel Studios Production and Development executive overseeing the series, was reassigned and expected to leave the studio when his contract expired at the end of 2023. Jonathan Schwartz, a senior Marvel Studios executive and a member of the Marvel Studios Parliament group, was dispatched to oversee the production. Bezucha also left the series during this time due to new scheduling conflicts with the reshoots.[44] Jackson said because Selim became the director of all the series' episodes, it provided consistency for the cast and crew with the ideas and concepts and allowed Selim to make the series his way.[84] Eben Bolter served as the cinematographer during additional photography which lasted for four months.[1]\n\nPete Beaudreau, Melissa Lawson Cheung, Drew Kilcoin,[13] and James Stanger serve as editors,[88] while Georgina Street serves as the visual effects producer and Aharon Bourland as the visual effects supervisor.[13] Visual effects for the series were provided by Digital Domain, FuseFX, Luma Pictures, MARZ, One of Us, Zoic Studios, and Cantina Creative.[89]\n\nIn February 2023, Kris Bowers was revealed to be composing for the series, and was working on the score at that time.[90] The series' main title track, \"Nick Fury (Main Title Theme)\", was released digitally as a single by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records on June 20.[91]\n\nAll music is composed by Kris Bowers\nAll music is composed by Kris Bowers\nThe first footage of the series debuted on Disney+ Day on November 12, 2021.[36] More footage was shown in July 2022 at San Diego Comic-Con. Adam B. Vary of Variety said the footage had an \"overall vibe... of paranoia and foreboding\", believing the series would fit with the larger \"anti-heroic thread\" building in Phase Five of the MCU.[92] The first trailer for the series debuted at the 2022 D23 Expo in September 2022. Polygon's Austen Goslin felt the trailer was \"mostly a recap of the series' plot\",[93] while Vanity Fair's Anthony Breznican noted how Fury had both eyes and said he \"appears to be done relying on others to help save the world\".[94] Tamera Jones from Collider felt the trailer was \"action-packed with explosions and intrigue, giving off more of a spy vibe than a fun paranoid mystery\".[95]\n\nThe second trailer debuted during Sunday Night Baseball on ESPN on April 2, 2023.[4] Edidiong Mboho of Collider felt the trailer \"evokes the thrill and excitement\" like the first one and provided the \"same sense of urgency and paranoia from the Skrull infiltration\". Mboho lauded the trailer for featuring the all-star cast of the series \"without giving too much away\" of its plot.[96] Dais Johnston of Inverse felt that every shot of the trailer provided a \"flashy-but-gritty spy-fi story that swaps out the powers and wisecracks of past works for the ingenuity and strategy Nick Fury is known for\".[97] Sam Barsanti of The A.V. Club said the trailer featured \"more of the physical and psychological toll that life in general has taken on Fury\".[98] In early June 2023, a viral marketing website was created for the series that featured a five-minute clip from the first episode and a new trailer for the series. The locked website was initially revealed through cryptic images tweeted on the series' official Twitter account, which included clues to form the password that allowed access to it.[16] At San Diego Comic-Con in July 2023, a Skrull \"invasion\" occurred, with fans seeing or becoming Skrulls around the convention.[99]\n\nA red carpet premiere event for Secret Invasion was held in Los Angeles at the El Capitan Theater on June 13, 2023.[31] The series debuted on Disney+ on June 21, 2023,[4] consisting of six episodes,[43] and concluding on July 26, 2023.[100] It was previously expected to release within early 2023.[92] It is the first series of Phase Five of the MCU.[101] The first three episodes were made available on Hulu from July 21 to August 17, 2023,[100] to promote the finale of the series.[99]\n\nAccording to market research company Parrot Analytics, which looks at consumer engagement in consumer research, streaming, downloads, and on social media, reported that Secret Invasion was the most in-demand new show in the U.S. for the quarter from April 1 to June 30, 2023. It garnered 42.1 times the average series demand in its first 30 days. The series experienced higher initial demand spikes compared to other Marvel series on Disney+.[102][103] Whip Media, which tracks viewership data for the more than 25 million worldwide users of its TV Time app, calculated that Secret Invasion was the seventh most-watched streaming original television series of 2023.[104][105] According to the file-sharing news website TorrentFreak, Secret Invasion was the fifth most-watched pirated television series of 2023.[106][107] Parrot Analytics reported that Secret Invasion was the third most in-demand streaming original of 2023, with 40 times the average demand for shows.[108][109]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 52%, with an average score of 6.1/10, based on 197 reviews. The site's critic's consensus states: \"A well-deserved showcase for Samuel L. Jackson, Secret Invasion steadies itself after a somewhat slow start by taking the MCU in a darker, more mature direction.\"[110] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 63 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[111]\n\nRichard Newby at Empire gave the series 4 out of 5 stars, feeling that it was \"a riveting, tense drama that gifts its actors with weighty material and encourages its audience to look beyond the sheen of superheroism.\" Newby found the series had taken a \"sharp turn\" from the sense of comfort of previous MCU projects due to the depiction of mature themes, such as terrorism and torture.[112] Eric Deggans of NPR praised the performance of Samuel L. Jackson and called the series an \"antidote to superhero fatigue\", writing, \"By centering on an aging Nick Fury who is struggling to handle a crisis created by his own broken promises, we get a story focused much more on a flawed hero than some kind of super-person juggling computer-generated cars.\"[113]\n\nLucy Mangan of The Guardian gave the show a grade of 3 out of 5 stars, stating, \"Some moments in Marvel's latest TV series remind you how utterly watchable brilliant actors are – despite this darker, more mature outing needing a tad more thought.\"[114] Barry Hertz of The Globe and Mail said \"The chases are slow, the explosions meh, the entire pace and tempo sluggish... The real folly of Secret Invasion is that it compels the best actors of any Marvel series so far to squirm while delivering soul-deadening expository dialogue.\"[115]\n\nTVLine placed Secret Invasion third on their list of the 10 Worst Shows of 2023.[123]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced.[124] The special on this series, \"The Making of Secret Invasion\", was released on Disney+ on September 20, 2023.[125]\n\nIn September 2022, Feige stated that Secret Invasion would lead into Armor Wars, with Cheadle set to reprise his role as Rhodes.[126][127] The series was originally believed to tie in with the film The Marvels, in which Jackson reprises his role as Fury,[128] but that film largely ignores the events of Secret Invasion. Matt Webb Mitovich at TVLine speculated that it likely was intended for The Marvels to be set before Secret Invasion, given that film had numerous previous release dates prior to Secret Invasion's premiere, though if so, that assumption \"still leaves continuity issues all over the place\".[129]\n\n\n"

        "content": "\n\nEcho is an American television miniseries created for the streaming service Disney+, based on Marvel Comics featuring the character of the same name. A spin-off from the series Hawkeye (2021), it is the 10th television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) produced by Marvel Studios, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. It sees Maya Lopez return to her hometown where she must come to terms with her past, reconnect with her Native American roots, and embrace her family and community. Marion Dayre and Amy Rardin serve as head writers and Sydney Freeland leads the directing team.\n\nAlaqua Cox reprises her role as Maya Lopez / Echo from Hawkeye, with Chaske Spencer, Tantoo Cardinal, Charlie Cox, Devery Jacobs, Zahn McClarnon, Cody Lightning, Graham Greene, and Vincent D'Onofrio also starring. Development of the spin-off began by March 2021, when Alaqua Cox was confirmed to be returning and Etan and Emily Cohen were attached as head writers. The series was formally announced in November 2021, when Dayre was revealed to be serving as head writer, with Freeland set to direct by March 2022. Filming took place from late April to late August 2022, in the Atlanta metropolitan area including Atlanta, Peachtree City, Social Circle, and Grantville, Georgia. In May 2022, Marvel revealed further cast members and that Catriona McKenzie would also direct for the series, while Rardin's involvement was revealed in September.\n\nEcho was released in its entirety simultaneously on Disney+ and Hulu on January 9, 2024, consisting of five episodes. It is Marvel Studios' first television release to debut on Hulu and to receive a TV-MA rating. It is part of Phase Five of the MCU and the first series under the \"Marvel Spotlight\" banner. The series received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\nFive months after the events of Hawkeye (2021),[2] Maya Lopez is being pursued by Wilson Fisk's organization, leading her to return to her hometown in Oklahoma, where she must come to terms with her past, reconnect with her Native American roots, and embrace her family and community.[3][4][5]\n\nAdditionally, Katarina Ziervogel portrays Taloa, Maya's mother.[24] Julia Jones, Morningstar Angeline, and Dannie McCallum appear, in vignettes and flashes, as Maya's ancestors Chafa, Lowak, and Tuklo: per variations of the Choctaw origin story, Chafa was the first Choctaw, helping her people emerge to the world from a cave-in at Nanih Waiya; Lowak was a Choctaw tribeswoman in 1200 who competed in a game of Choctaw Stickball; and Tuklo was the first female Lighthorseman.[25] Andrew Howard, who previously portrayed Luther Banks in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013–2020), recurs as Zane, one of the leaders of the Black Knife Cartel who is loyal to Fisk.[26] Thomas E. Sullivan, who previously portrayed Nathaniel Malick in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., appears as Victor \"Vickie\" Tyson, an employee at Henry's bowling rink.[27] Jeremy Renner appears as Clint Barton / Ronin in the first episode through archive footage from Hawkeye,[28] while Richie Palmer Sr. and ML Gemmill, respectively, voice Fisk's parents Bill and Marlene Fisk in the final episode, replacing Domenick Lombardozzi and Angela Reed, who portrayed the characters in Daredevil.[29] Pat Kiernan and Errol Louis portray themselves in the mid-credits scene of \"Maya\".[30]\n\nA flashback reveals the origins of the Choctaw, with Chafa emerging as a human from under the earth at Nanih Waiya.\n\nIn a flashback to Alabama in 1200 AD, Lowak is participating in a game of Choctaw Stickball against a Cherokee tribe. When Lowak's team is close to winning, the opposing side send out a formidable warrior who helps to even the score. Lowak is desperate to avoid exile for her team if they should lose and receives a vision during an intense melee. With her hands glowing, Lowak breaks out of the melee with the ball and secures victory for her tribe.\n\nIn a flashback to the late 1800s, Tuklo practices shooting with her father, one of the Lighthorsemen. Despite wanting to be a lighthorseman, her father forbids this due to her gender. Tuklo's father rides out to confront some local criminals while Tuklo braids her hair like a Choctaw warrior. She receives a vision of Chafa and Lowak, and her hands begin to glow. The criminals ambush Tuklo's father, but she hears the attack and arrives in time to save him and his group.\n\nIn 2008, a young Maya is mocked by an ice cream vendor, who fails to understand her request for ice cream as he doesn't know that she's deaf. An enraged Fisk retaliates by brutally attacking the ice cream vendor. Although Maya witnesses this, she kicks the ice cream vendor as payback for his cruelty, showing no remorse towards him. Several years later, Maya is about to begin working for Fisk when he offers a final lesson – they can only trust one another. While they finish their shared dinner, Fisk's ASL translator is dismissed and soon killed.\n\nIn a flashback to her childhood, Maya hits a woodpecker with a slingshot. Taloa reprimands Maya for hurting an innocent life, and, with her hands glowing, heals the woodpecker. Later, the two release it back into the wild.\n\nIn December 2020, deaf and amputee newcomer Alaqua Cox was announced as having been cast as the Marvel Comics character Maya Lopez / Echo in Marvel Studios' Disney+ series Hawkeye (2021).[31][32] By March 2021, Marvel Studios was in early development on a spin-off from Hawkeye centered on Cox's Lopez for Disney+, with Etan Cohen and Emily Cohen set to write and executive produce.[33] During the Disney+ Day event in November 2021, the series was officially announced as Echo,[34] and Marion Dayre was serving as head writer by then instead of the Cohens.[35] Amy Rardin would also join the series to serve as head writer alongside Dayre.[6][36][7] Bert & Bertie, who directed the Hawkeye episode \"Echoes\" in which Lopez is introduced, did not believe they would be involved with the spin-off series and felt it would be appropriate for someone in the Native American community to further tell the character's story.[37] In March 2022, Sydney Freeland shared a casting call on her Instagram page, indicating her involvement in the series as a director.[38] Marvel Studios confirmed Freeland as a director in May, while also announcing that Catriona McKenzie would also direct for the series.[4] Freeland directed all episodes except the third, which was directed by McKenzie.[39] Marvel Studios' Kevin Feige, Stephen Broussard, Louis D'Esposito, Brad Winderbaum, Victoria Alonso, and Richie Palmer serve as executive producers along with Dayre, Jason Gavin, and Freeland, while Rardin is a co-executive producer.[40][41] The series consists of five episodes,[40] which reportedly had a budget of $40 million, the lowest for a Marvel Studios series at the time of its release.[42][1]\n\nA writers' room for the series had been formed by the time development of the project was revealed in March 2021.[33] In addition to Dayre and Rardin, writers for the series include Josh Feldman, Steven P. Judd, Ken Kristensen, Rebecca Roanhorse, Bobby Wilson, Ellen Morton, Jason Gavin, Shoshannah Stern, and Chantelle Wells.[43] In November 2021, Dayre indicated that Dara Resnik, Jessica Mecklenburg, Kaitlyn Jeffers, and Paloma Lamb would also be writers on the series,[44] though they were not credited for any episodes.[43] At least two episodes had been written by mid-February 2022, while writing for the other episodes was still continuing.[45] Marvel said the series would explore the consequences of Lopez's actions in Hawkeye and reveal her origin story.[4] Lopez's Indigeneity is reimagined for the MCU, having her be a member of the Choctaw tribe in Oklahoma rather than being from the Blackfeet Nation as in the comics. Freeland explained that the visuals in the comics \"amounted to a 'hodgepodge' of imagery that made for a 'muddied' and ultimately inauthentic backstory for the character\". She described the series as an exploration of trauma.[6] Judd, who is Choctaw, helped bring authenticity to the writing of the series.[8]: 7  The first episode employs flashbacks to help explain Lopez's backstory as well as including her appearances on Hawkeye, which is \"touch[ed] on in a way that you just know what you need to know upfront\".[14] The series is set five months after Hawkeye, in May 2025.[2] Location manager Ryan Schaetzle said the story would focus on a small town.[45] Supervising producer Eleena Khamedoost said setting Echo in Tamaha, Oklahoma was \"attractive\" as it allowed the writers to make it a character in the series, and \"showcase a world we have never seen in the MCU\".[8]: 6 \n\nBorys Kit of The Hollywood Reporter described Echo as \"a grounded crime story\",[46] while his colleague Aaron Couch compared its tone and footage to Daredevil (2015–2018), Breaking Bad (2008–2013), and John Wick (2014), calling it \"Marvel's version of a cable drama rather than an MCU streaming series\".[47] The series is the first Marvel Studios project to receive a TV-MA rating, which executive producer Brad Winderbaum called \"a new direction for the [Marvel Studios] brand\". Freeland added that this rating allowed the characters to be shown as \"people\", ones that \"bleed, they die, they get killed and there are real consequences\".[6] Freeland drew inspiration from Daredevil and The Punisher (2017–2019).[41] Winderbaum and Freeland noted that the series would have \"street-level stakes\" that would be less focused on the larger MCU narrative and \"cosmic consequences\",[48][49] with Freeland adding it was \"not the fate of the universe\" but \"the fate of family\". Much of the series is set after the events of Hawkeye while also exploring a \"seismic event\" in Lopez's family history and how that leads her towards Wilson Fisk / Kingpin.[6] Family is one of the main themes of the series, specifically how it is defined, with a spectrum of family dynamics shown in the series: Fisk and Lopez's conditional, \"unhealthy family relationship\" on one side, and Lopez's biological family on another. Freeland said, at the start of Echo, Lopez has \"one definition of family, and over the course of the show we're going to challenge that definition and see if she's able to see things in a different way\".[50] Echo is initially portrayed as a villain in the comics, something Freeland was drawn to and Marvel Studios encouraged her to further explore and \"push the envelope\" with.[49]\n\nAlaqua Cox was expected to reprise her role in the series with the reveal of its development in March 2021,[33] which was confirmed with the series' official announcement in November 2021 for Disney+ Day.[34] By August 2021, casting for the series was underway, with Marvel Studios looking to cast deaf Native American or Latinx women.[51] In April 2022, Vincent D'Onofrio and Charlie Cox were revealed to be involved with the series, reprising their roles as Wilson Fisk / Kingpin and Matt Murdock / Daredevil from prior MCU media.[52][53] By the end of the month, Devery Jacobs was cast in an undisclosed role, reported to be a lead of the series named Julie, which Deadline Hollywood described as \"resilient and strong willed\".[16] In May 2022, Marvel confirmed Jacobs's casting and announced that Chaske Spencer, Tantoo Cardinal, Cody Lightning, and Graham Greene would also star in the series,[4] with Zahn McClarnon reprising his role as Echo's father William Lopez from Hawkeye.[17][4] Charlie Cox and D'Onofrio were confirmed to be returning for the series in July 2022.[12] In September 2023, a United States Copyright Office filing for the series revealed that Spencer was playing Henry, Cardinal playing Chula, Greene playing Skully, Lightning playing Cousin Biscuits, and Jacobs playing Bonnie.[54][8]: 5–6 \n\nAndrew Howard, who previously portrayed Luther Banks in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013–2020), recurs in the series as Zane, one of Fisk's henchmen.[26] Archive footage of Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Ronin from Hawkeye is featured in the first episode,[28] while Richie Palmer Sr. and ML Gemmill respectively voice Fisk's parents Bill and Marlene Fisk in the final episode, replacing Domenick Lombardozzi and Phyllis Somerville, who portrayed the characters in Daredevil.[29] Deaf actress Katarina Ziervogel portrays Maya's mother Taloa.[24]\n\nBy April 2022, Marvel Studios was looking to cast background performers and extras, particularly Native Americans, for two waves of filming. The first group of around 30 people would portray a \"core group\" of townspeople,[55] while background casting for actual powwow dancers and singers occurred to give the series an additional level of authenticity.[56][6] The series worked with hundreds of Native Americans from all around the country.[8]: 8  Freeland revealed that Echo features a number of cameos from other films and series that are in service to Lopez and \"have a story motivation behind\" their appearance.[49]\n\nThe Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma along with advisers from the woman-led organization IllumiNative were consulted on the representation of Choctaw culture, legends, and history portrayed in the series.[48] The various department heads were able to travel to the Choctaw Nation in Oklahoma to learn more about the language and culture of the Choctaw, as well as experience it first hand while attending a powwow. They worked with Choctaw Chief Gary Batton, Tribal Historic Preservation Officer Dr. Ian Thompson, and executive director of Cultural Services Seth Fairchild. Fairchild said the Choctaw Nation saw Echo as \"an opportunity to really lend our voice and culture on a scale that would otherwise not have been possible.\"[8]: 6–7 \n\nIt's not just a suit, it's a war record. It's a unique and symbolic costume and represents Maya coming into her own and accepting her spot in her real family. It is her saying, 'I am Maya Lopez,' and I echo the powers of the ancestors not just in my kickass abilities, but in the way I dress, the way I braid my hair and down to the details on my prosthetic leg.\n\nAmbre Wrigley serves as the costume designer for the series, and called it \"critical\" to be able to collaborate with the Choctaw on the look of the costumes. Wrigley spoke with \"at least five different tribal leaders and historians\" and employed a group of Choctaw artisans to make costume items.[8]: 7  Lopez's hero suit was designed alongside Choctaw artists, who made sure it represented their people and still provided a \"powerful reveal\" upon its debut towards the end of the series. Cox explained that it features symbolism for happiness and power from Choctaw culture, along with bead work and gems that are meant to represent the skin from a western diamondback rattlesnake, \"a very power animal\" respected by the Choctaw.[8]: 8  Daredevil's costume in the series is a \"new take\" on his costume from the Netflix series, with the design closer to the one he wore in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022) with more red. The Netflix costume was originally designed by Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding, who \"tweaked\" it for Echo to \"honor classic Daredevil\" and bring the \"quintessential\" look of the character to this series.[57] Chris Trujillo serves as the production designer.[58][8]: 8  The department heads were able to buy items directly from the Choctaw people, adding to the authenticity.[8]: 7 \n\nPrincipal photography began on April 21, 2022,[59] at Trilith Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia,[8]: 2  as well as throughout the Atlanta metropolitan area, in Atlanta,[60] with Freeland and McKenzie directing.[4] Cinematographers include Kira Kelly for Freeland's episodes,[61] and Magdalena Gorka for McKenzie's episode.[62][63] The series was filmed using the working titles Grasshopper and Whole Branzino.[60][64] A traditional Choctaw blessing ceremony was performed before the start of production.[8]: 2  Filming was set to occur along the Great Walton Railroad in Social Circle, Georgia in April,[65] as well as in and around Peachtree City, Georgia from late April to late August 2022.[66] Filming was previously expected to begin in February 2022,[51] as well as in early April.[60] Filming establishing shots for two episodes took place in Grantville, Georgia from May 16 to 20, on various streets in the town, the Grantville water tower, and Bonnie Castle.[45] Filming outside Atlanta occurred with the first group of extras around June 1, with the second group for three weeks in July,[55] and with the dancers and singers extras for around two-to-three weeks in July.[56] The powwow set was built on a rural county fairground that Trujillo felt \"had this great tone, texture and character\".[8]: 8  It was initially difficult to find locations in Georgia to double as Oklahoma, but the creatives were able to use their trip to the Choctaw Nation and scout the surrounding areas to gather reference photos and information that helped inform them on locations in Georgia that would work for shooting.[8]: 7  Filming occurred over 92 days,[67] and wrapped on August 26, 2022.[68]\n\nFreeland worked to ensure her close-up shots included actors signing, with many on the crew taking American Sign Language classes.[6] They learned that unlike speaking, which conveys text and subtext, signing conveys the text while a person's face convey's the subtext, which changed Freeland's approach to filming Lopez.[50] Douglas Ridloff served as the ASL consultant and a consulting producer,[15][39] after previously doing so on Hawkeye and Eternals (2021),[69] with the series employing ASL and Indigenous ASL interpreters. Ridloff, who is the husband of Eternals actress Lauren Ridloff,[69] would adjust his translations of English to sign language depending on each character, taking into account things such as what their proficiency should be or familial or regional dialects.[15] For example, Bonnie signs without speaking as she is proficient while the elder characters such as Chula sign slower and use SimCom, which is signing and speaking at the same time.[50] Ridloff was also able to incorporate Plains Indian Sign Language and other Indigenous sign languages that \"date back to pre-colonization\" into the series.[15]\n\nIn May 2023, Jeff Sneider of Above the Line reported that the series was originally filmed as eight episodes and after various production issues, had been found by Feige to be \"unreleasable\"; discussions were then had about possibly editing what had been filmed into four or six episodes during post-production before it was ultimately decided to reshoot much of the series.[70] The series ultimately consists of five episodes.[40] Due to its grounded story, it was reported as having fewer visual effects compared to Marvel Studios' other series.[46] Editors for the series are Joel Pashby,[71] Chris McCaleb, Amelia Allwarden, Shelby Hall,[72] and Tania Goding.[11]\n\nBy February 2023, Mato Wayuhi was working on the score for the series,[73] but was no longer involved by the end of July or start of August.[74] Dave Porter revealed in December that he was serving as the composer for the series.[75][74] The title track was released by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on January 5, 2024,[76] followed by the series' soundtrack album on January 12, 2024.[77] \"Burning\" by Yeah Yeah Yeahs is heard over the main titles. The soundtrack heavily featured several pre-existing vocal songs, as opposed to prior MCU Disney+ series which traditionally featured original scores.[78]\n\nAll music is composed by Dave Porter, except where noted.\nAlaqua Cox, D'Onofrio, Jacobs, Greene, Cody Lightning, Chaske Spencer, and Feige presented the first footage of the series in a first-look video at the D23 Expo in September 2022,[79][7] which included subtitles. Wilson Chapman of Variety highlighted many scenes featuring Echo \"kicking ass\" and of the Native American people, and the appearance of Vincent D'Onofrio's Kingpin with an eyepatch.[7] Aidan Kelley from Collider said the footage perfectly set up the series' tone and made it clear that Lopez's Native American heritage would be prominent throughout. Kelley also said the footage showed Lopez being \"a total badass with an incredible performance from Alaqua Cox who just exudes charisma without uttering a single word\".[80] The first trailer was released on November 3, 2023.[6] Michael McWhertor at Polygon called the footage \"shockingly violent\" and pointed out its inclusion of a brief Daredevil cameo.[81] Later that day, the first two episodes were screened at the District area of the Choctaw Casinos & Resorts in Durant, Oklahoma, with Freeland also participating in a Q&A. The MOWA Choctaw Cultural Center also began one of the Choctaw Nation's largest annual powwows to promote the series and celebrate National American Indian Heritage Month.[48][82] A trailer released on December 16, 2023, that indicated the series' earlier release date, was noted for its brutal and bloody violence,[83][84][85][86] which Ray Flook of Bleeding Cool believed was the most seen in a Marvel series since Marvel Television's Netflix series.[84] ComicBook.com's Adam Barnhardt pointed out the use of narration in the trailer, \"a rare occurrence for a Marvel Studios show\", to note Echo's use of violence.[85]\n\nA teaser released a week before the series' premiere included footage of Fisk and Daredevil from Daredevil.[87] James Whitbrook at Gizmodo opined that this, along with comments from Winderbaum about personally believing Daredevil should be part of the MCU's Sacred Timeline, was \"[s]addling Echo as [a] proto-Daredevil sequel\" that \"speaks to the complex, complicated ways Marvel now has to deal with the shared universe boom\". He also found it \"funny\" that Echo was focusing on its connections to Daredevil when it was supposed to be the first \"Marvel Spotlight\" series that was created to be largely standalone and free from needing to know other films or series to understand and watch.[88] Following the series' release, Cox promoted it with several talk show appearances while Freeland was set to discuss the series at the Sundance Film Festival and at the racial justice organization IllumiNative's Indigenous House.[89]\n\nEcho was simultaneously released in its entirety on Disney+ and Hulu on January 9, 2024, at 9 p.m. Eastern Time, consisting of five episodes.[90] The series was the first Marvel Studios series to release all of its episodes at once, as the studio's previous series were released weekly.[91][92][90] Echo was available on Hulu until April 9, 2024.[81] A Choctaw language dub of the episodes became available on November 1, 2024.[93][94] Consultant Terry Billy explained that translating between English and Choctaw was about getting as close as possible to the intended verbiage or context and, when that was not possible, interpreting the context into \"everyday\" Choctaw.[94]\n\nThe series was originally scheduled to be released in mid-2023,[95] before Dayre stated in December 2022 that the series would likely be released around a year from then, indicating a late 2023 premiere,[96] which Marvel Studios subsequently announced as November 29, 2023,[97] before it was delayed in September 2023 to January 10, 2024.[98] Marvel Studios later announced the series would debut the night before on January 9.[90] It is part of Phase Five of the MCU,[95] and the first series released under the \"Marvel Spotlight\" banner.[48]\n\nEcho premiered at number one on both Disney+ and Hulu.[99][100] Its release also led to increased viewership for Hawkeye, the first two seasons of Daredevil, and the first season of The Punisher on Disney+.[89] The streaming aggregator Reelgood reported that Echo ranked as the fifth most-streamed program during the week of January 11, 2024.[101][102] According to streaming aggregator JustWatch, Echo ranked as the fifth most-streamed television series from January 8 to 11, 2024.[103] Whip Media, which tracks viewership data for the more than 25 million worldwide users of its TV Time app, calculated that Echo was the sixth most streamed original television series across all platforms in the United States during the week of January 28, 2024,[104] and the tenth during the week of February 4, 2024.[105] Nielsen Media Research, which records streaming viewership on U.S. television screens, estimated that the series was watched for 731 million minutes from January 8 to 14, 2024.[106][107] Nielsen also reported that Echo attracted an audience typical of Marvel series, with two-thirds of viewers aged 35–64 and 60% male.[108]\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 70% approval rating with an average rating of 6.4/10, based on 88 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Alaqua Cox makes Echo's first season consistently worth watching, while hard-hitting action and fresh narrative elements suggest strong potential for this slow-building series.\"[109] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 62 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[110]\n\nCox's performance was an honorable mention for TVLine Performer of the Week for the week ending January 13, 2024, with Keisha Hatchett stating Cox \"delivered her best performance\" in the series' finale episode where she \"unleashed the Choctaw warrior within\", calling it \"empowering to see her cry while speaking with her mother's spirit, her tear-filled eyes packing a harder punch than the physical blows in the scenes that followed\".[111] Cox is nominated for Best Actress in a Limited Series or TV Movie at the 4th Astra TV Awards,[112] while Ambre Wrigley, Kizzie Martin Lillas, and Kristina Elaine Taylor are nominated for Outstanding Fantasy/Sci-Fi Costumes at the 76th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards for their work on \"Lowak\".[113]\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced.[114] The special on this series, \"The Making of Echo\", was released on Disney+ on January 31, 2024. It explores how the creative team learned American Sign Language and worked to accurately portray Native American culture, as well as the collaboration between Marvel Studios and the Choctaw Nation.[115]\n\nIn November 2022, D'Onofrio stated that Echo would lead into the events of the Disney+ series Daredevil: Born Again, with D'Onofrio and Charlie Cox reprising their respective roles as Wilson Fisk / Kingpin and Matt Murdock / Daredevil.[116] Following the series' successful debut, Marvel Studios reportedly expressed interest in using Echo for future MCU projects and began developing new ideas related to its street-level heroes.[89]\n"

        "content": "\n\nIronheart is an upcoming American television miniseries created by Chinaka Hodge for the streaming service Disney+, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It is intended to be the 14th television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) produced by Marvel Studios, via its Marvel Television label, alongside Proximity Media sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. Hodge serves as head writer.\n\nDominique Thorne reprises her role as Riri Williams / Ironheart from the film Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022), starring alongside Anthony Ramos, Lyric Ross, Alden Ehrenreich, Regan Aliyah, Manny Montana, Matthew Elam, and Anji White. The series was announced in December 2020, along with Thorne's casting. Hodge was hired in April 2021, with additional castings revealed in February 2022. Sam Bailey and Angela Barnes joined to direct in April 2022. Filming began at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia by early June, before moving to Chicago in late October, and concluded by early November.\n\nIronheart is scheduled to premiere on Disney+ on June 24, 2025, and will consist of six episodes. It will be the conclusion of Phase Five of the MCU.\n\nFollowing the events of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022), MIT student Riri Williams returns home to Chicago where she becomes entangled with the enigmatic Parker Robbins / The Hood, discovering secrets that pit technology against magic and setting her on a path of danger and adventure.[1][2][3]\n\nAdditionally, Jim Rash reprises his role as the Dean of MIT from Captain America: Civil War (2016).[10] Shea Couleé stars as Slug.[1] Harper Anthony,[11] Zoe Terakes,[12] Regan Aliyah,[8] Shakira Barrera,[13] Rashida \"Sheedz\" Olayiwola,[14] Sonia Denis,[15] Paul Calderón,[16] Cree Summer,[17] and Sacha Baron Cohen have been cast in undisclosed roles.[1][9]\n\nA film based on the Marvel Comics character Riri Williams / Ironheart had a script written by Jada Rodriguez by July 2018, when it was listed on The Black List, although this did not materialize.[21] In December 2020, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige announced the Disney+ television series Ironheart.[4] In April 2021, Chinaka Hodge was hired to serve as head writer of the series.[22] In March 2022, series actor Anthony Ramos revealed that Ryan Coogler, the director of Black Panther (2018) and its sequel Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022), was involved in the production;[23] star Dominique Thorne first appears as Riri Williams / Ironheart in Wakanda Forever,[24] and Coogler's production company Proximity Media was set to work alongside Marvel Studios on select Disney+ series as part of a television deal with Walt Disney Television.[25][23] In April, Coogler's Proximity Media was confirmed to be producing the series, when Sam Bailey and Angela Barnes joined to each direct three episodes of the series.[18] Ironheart will consist of six episodes.[22] Executive producers on the series include Marvel Studios' Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Brad Winderbaum, and Zoie Nagelhout; Proximity Media's Coogler, Zinzi Coogler, and Sev Ohanian; and Hodge.[3] Eve Ewing, co-creator of Ironheart in the comics, serves as consulting producer.[26] It is being released under Marvel Studios' \"Marvel Television\" label.[27]\n\nMalarie Howard, Francesca Gailes, Jacqueline J. Gailes, Amir Sulaiman, and Cristian Martinez serve as writers for the series alongside Hodge,[19] with the Gailes both previously writing on She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022).[28] The writers' room for the series was set to begin in May 2021.[22] Feige felt the conflict between Riri's technology and the magic of Parker Robbins / The Hood made the series unique within the MCU.[6] Marvel Studios executive Nate Moore described the series as a direct sequel to Wakanda Forever by exploring \"interesting repercussions\" of Riri's experiences in that film when she returns to her home.[29] The series sees Riri being expelled from MIT for skipping classes and using too many of the university's resources, which causes her to engage in illegal activities, such as joining the Hood and his gang, to fund her projects.[30] Setting the series in Riri's hometown of Chicago, which Ramos called a character in its own right that is part of the identity of all the characters, gives her and the other characters \"options\" in trying to get ahead, be it with power, money, or something else. Ramos explained that this affects each of the characters positively and negatively, and that eventually each choice made starts to interweave in other characters' journeys. The writers tried to make complicated characters who were neither entirely good or evil, with star Alden Ehrenreich believing the writers presented \"a psychological, emotional portrait\" of each character.[5]\n\nDominique Thorne was revealed to have been cast as Riri Williams / Ironheart with the series' announcement,[4] after Marvel Studios offered her the role without auditioning;[31] Thorne had previously auditioned for Black Panther (2018) and was told then by Marvel Studios that they wanted to work with her on a future project after she had more experience.[32] In February 2022, Anthony Ramos joined the series as Parker Robbins / The Hood,[33][6] described as a \"key role\" and the series' main villain.[33][7] Deadline Hollywood reported that his role would expand to other MCU projects, similar to how Jonathan Majors appeared as He Who Remains in the first season of Loki (2021) ahead of his appearance as Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023).[33] Later that month, Lyric Ross was cast as Riri's best friend.[7] Newcomer Harper Anthony joined the cast in an undisclosed role by April,[11] followed by Manny Montana in June.[34] A month later, Alden Ehrenreich joined the cast in a \"key role\".[35]\n\nFrom August to October 2022, Shea Couleé,[36] Zoe Terakes,[12] Regan Aliyah,[8] Shakira Barrera,[13] Rashida \"Sheedz\" Olayiwola,[14] Sonia Denis,[15] Paul Calderón,[16] and Cree Summer joined the cast in undisclosed roles.[17] At the D23 Expo in September, Jim Rash was revealed to be reprising his role as the Dean of MIT from Captain America: Civil War (2016).[10] The following month, Deadline Hollywood reported that Sacha Baron Cohen had joined the MCU, in a role that would see him potentially first appear in the later episodes of Ironheart followed by appearances in other MCU projects. His role was likely to be the character Mephisto, which would be portrayed by Baron Cohen in-person as well as through CGI.[37][17] In June 2023, Anji White was revealed as a series regular, believed to be portraying Riri's mother Ronnie.[9] A United States Copyright Office filing revealed in October 2023 for the series revealed that Ehrenreich was playing Joe McGillicuddy, Ross playing Natalie Washington, Matthew Elam playing Xavier Washington, White playing Ronnie Williams, Montana playing Cousin John, and Couleé playing Slug, while Baron Cohen would appear in the series.[1]\n\nAndrew Menzies serves as the production designer for the series.[38]\n\nFilming for the series occurred in Chicago in late May 2022, to capture plate shots and exterior establishing shots.[39][40][41] Principal photography had begun by June 2,[34][41] at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia,[42] under the working title Wise Guy,[43][44] with Bailey and Barnes directing.[18] Alison Kelly and Ante Cheng serve as cinematographers.[45][46] Filming occurred in September on Edgewood Avenue in Sweet Auburn, Atlanta, at a building constructed to stand in for a White Castle in Chicago.[47][48] Filming was scheduled to move to Chicago by October 24, 2022, to run through November 3, in South Side, Near North Side, and Downtown Chicago.[49] Filming had wrapped by early November 2022.[50][51] In late January 2024, Thorne said that filming had concluded,[52] though additional photography was reported to occur from February to April 2024.[53] A full, practical Ironheart suit was created for filming to help as a lighting and visual effects reference, similar to techniques used on Iron Man (2008).[54]\n\nWinderbaum confirmed that the series was being edited by March 2024.[55] Cedric Nairn-Smith and Shannon Baker Davis serve as editors, with Nairn-Smith previously working on the Marvel Studios series Moon Knight (2022) and Daredevil: Born Again (2025).[56][57]\n\nFootage from the series was shown at the 2022 D23 Expo.[6] Thorne and Ramos promoted the series at Disney's May 2024 upfront presentation, where the release year was announced.[58] The pair again promoted the series that August, at Disney's D23 convention, with Coogler, Ross, Ramos, Ehrenreich, and Aliyah. Footage from the series was shown,[2][59] which Jacob Hall of /Film described as \"a crime show with an Iron Man twist at the center\".[60] Following online leaks of the D23 footage, Marvel released an official look at Riri in her Ironheart armor within their video celebrating the company's 85th anniversary.[61] More footage from the series was included in a video that was released by Disney+ in October, announcing the release schedule for Marvel Television and Marvel Animation projects through the end of 2025.[20]\n\nIronheart is scheduled to premiere on Disney+ on June 24, 2025,[20] and will consist of six episodes.[22] The series was originally scheduled to debut in late 2023,[62] however, by February 2023 it was unlikely to premiere that year as Disney and Marvel Studios were re-evaluating their content output.[63] In May, it was reported to be releasing in 2024,[64] but was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule in September 2023, with the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes affecting the series' ability to be completed.[65] The next month, a filing for the first episode with the United States Copyright Office indicated an approximate release on September 3, 2025.[1] The June 2025 release date was announced a year later.[20] It will be the final series of Phase Five of the MCU.[62]\n"

        "content": "\n\nAgatha All Along is an American television miniseries created by Jac Schaeffer for the streaming service Disney+, based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Agatha Harkness. A spin-off from the miniseries WandaVision (2021), it is the 11th television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) produced by Marvel Studios and the first to be released under its Marvel Television label. The series shares continuity with the films of the MCU. Schaeffer served as showrunner and lead director.\n\nKathryn Hahn reprises her role as Agatha Harkness from WandaVision, with Joe Locke, Debra Jo Rupp, Aubrey Plaza, Sasheer Zamata, Ali Ahn, Okwui Okpokwasili, Patti LuPone, Evan Peters, Maria Dizzia, Paul Adelstein, and Miles Gutierrez-Riley also starring. Development began in October 2021 with Schaeffer and Hahn attached, and the series was formally announced the next month. Schaeffer, Rachel Goldberg, and Gandja Monteiro were set as directors in early 2023 ahead of filming, which took place from January to May 2023 at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, as well as in Los Angeles. Cast and crew returned from WandaVision, including the series' musical team. Several different titles were announced for the series as part of a marketing campaign before the official title of Agatha All Along—referencing the song of the same name from WandaVision—was announced in May 2024.\n\nAgatha All Along premiered on Disney+ on September 18, 2024, and ran for nine episodes until October 30, as part of Phase Five of the MCU. It received positive reviews from critics, particularly for Hahn's performance, for which she received a Golden Globe Award nomination.\n\nThree years after being trapped under a magical spell in the town of Westview, New Jersey, at the end of the miniseries WandaVision (2021), the witch Agatha Harkness escapes with the help of a mysterious teenager who wishes to face the trials of the legendary Witches' Road. Without her magical powers, Agatha and the teen form a new coven of witches to face the trials while contending with some of Agatha's old enemies.[2]\n\nReprising their roles from WandaVision as Westview residents who play characters within Agatha's Agnes of Westview reality are Emma Caulfield as Sarah Proctor / \"Dottie Jones\", David Payton as John Collins / \"Herb Feltman\", David Lengel as Sarah's husband Harold Proctor / \"Phil Jones\", Asif Ali as Abilash Tandon / \"Norm Gentilucci\", and Amos Glick as a pizza delivery man / \"Dennis Webber\". Kate Forbes also reprises her role from WandaVision as Agatha's mother Evanora Harkness.[27][28]\n\nThe remaining six members of the Salem Seven are Marina Mazepa as \"Snake\", Bethany Curry as \"Crow\", Athena Perample as \"Fox\", Britta Grant as \"Rat\", Alicia Vela-Bailey as \"Owl\", and Chau Naumova as \"Coyote\".[29] Additional guest stars include: Elizabeth Anweis as Alice's mother Lorna Wu;[30] Laura Boccaletti as Lilia's Maestra;[31] Scott Butler as a doctor linked to Jen's past; Jade Quon as the demon from the Wu's curse;[24] and Abel Lysenko as Nicholas Scratch, Agatha's son.[32] Hannah Lowther, Tetra Lloyd White, Henriette Zoutomou, Holly Bonney, and Kim Bass appear as witches trapped by Agatha and Nicholas during the 1750s.[24]\n\nAt Disney's biennial D23 Expo convention in August 2019, Kathryn Hahn was revealed to be cast in the role of Agnes, Wanda Maximoff and Vision's neighbor, in the Marvel Studios Disney+ television series WandaVision (2021).[34][35] That series' seventh episode reveals that \"Agnes\" is actually Agatha Harkness, a powerful witch from Marvel Comics.[36] In May 2021, WandaVision head writer Jac Schaeffer signed a three-year overall television deal with Marvel Studios and 20th Television to develop additional projects for the studios' Disney+ slate.[37] In pitches for several different projects centered on various characters, Schaeffer kept suggesting that Agatha be included as part of those series. This led to her and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige pursuing a series centered on that character instead.[38][11] By October 2021, a \"dark comedy\" spin-off from WandaVision centered on Hahn as Agatha was in early development for Disney+ from Marvel Studios,[4] with Schaeffer returning from WandaVision as head writer and executive producer.[4][3] Hahn's involvement was part of a larger deal she signed with Marvel Studios to reprise her role in series and films.[39]\n\nDuring a Disney+ Day event in November 2021, the series was officially announced.[3] Schaeffer was revealed to be directing episodes of the series a year later,[40] and Gandja Monteiro was revealed as another director in December 2022,[41] along with Rachel Goldberg in January 2023.[26] Each directed three episodes of the series.[22] By October 2023, Marvel Studios was changing its approach to television, hiring more traditional showrunners instead of head writers;[42] Schaeffer was being credited as the series' showrunner by July 2024.[43] Brad Winderbaum, the head of streaming, television, and animation at Marvel Studios, said Agatha All Along was the studio's least expensive series, costing less than the $40 million budget of Echo (2024), and he attributed this to the series' use of practical effects rather than computer-generated imagery.[1] Marvel Studios' Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Mary Livanos also served as executive producers.[43] The series is being released under Marvel Studios' \"Marvel Television\" label.[44] Actress Debra Jo Rupp, who returned from WandaVision, described the spin-off as being a second season of WandaVision in an anthology sense, similar to the different seasons of the television series American Horror Story (2011–present).[45] Agatha All Along is intended to be second in a trilogy of series that includes WandaVision and Vision Quest (2026).[46]\n\nThe series was initially announced with the title Agatha: House of Harkness,[3] but was renamed to Agatha: Coven of Chaos by July 2022.[47] The series was revealed to have been retitled once again in September 2023, this time to Agatha: Darkhold Diaries.[48] Actress Aubrey Plaza had previously posted a photo in May 2023 of a director's chair with that title, in a font based on the one used for the Disney film The Princess Diaries (2001).[49] Adam B. Vary at Variety reported that the multiple title changes were not caused by indecision from Marvel Studios and were instead indicating that the main character was \"up to her old skulduggery\",[50] and he said it was possible that the series was simply titled Agatha;[51] that is what the series was referred to as in a filing for the first episode with the United States Copyright Office as well as on the official Disney+ website.[52][53][54]\n\nIn May 2024, Marvel Studios released a new logo on Twitter with the title Agatha: The Lying Witch with Great Wardrobe, but took down the post soon after. Germain Lussier at Gizmodo thought this may have been a joke or a mistake and noted that it was referencing the C. S. Lewis novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950). He felt it was \"the worst title of the bunch\" despite being accurate to the character, and questioned why the series had received so many publicly announced titles during development. He felt the best choice would be Agatha All Along,[55] referring to the 'theme song' of the same name used when Agatha was revealed as the true villain in WandaVision.[56] The next day, Disney announced at an upfront presentation that the official title was Agatha All Along,[57][58] and released a video showing that the changing titles were \"orchestrated by [Agatha] as a way of messing with Marvel fans\".[59] Schaeffer and the writers conceived the various titles. Livanos enjoyed releasing \"crazier and crazier\" titles throughout the marketing stunt and felt it was appropriate for Agatha.[60]\n\nLaura Donney, Cameron Squires, Giovanna Sarquis, Laura Monti, Jason Rostovsky, Gia King, and Peter Cameron served as writers on the series, alongside Schaeffer.[61] Squires, Cameron, Donney, and Monti all returned from WandaVision,[62][63] alongside Megan McDonnell, who was a consulting producer, serving as the on-set writer.[64] Monti had served as Schaeffer's assistant on WandaVision, aiding in the creation of the acclaimed line \"What is grief, if not love persevering?\"[65] King and Rostovsky contributed to the writing process with their respective interests in divination and gothic horror.[66]  Livanos said the chance to continue Agatha Harkness's story and to get to know the character further was \"immediately an imperative\" for the creatives.[5] Winderbaum compared Agatha All Along to Marvel Studios' series Loki (2021–2023), because they both feature antiheroes, are different from the studios' other series, and explore similar emotional depths for their title characters.[67] Winderbaum called Agatha All Along a \"Halloween show\" that features a \"Marvel brand of scary\" with deadly stakes, while still being fun and dramatic.[68] Feige likened Agatha All Along to the film The Goonies (1985).[7] Comics that influenced the series included Scarlet Witch vol. 2 by James Robinson that introduced the Witches' Road, Agatha Harkness's early appearances in Fantastic Four, and The Vision and the Scarlet Witch vol. 2.[6]: 7:57–8:22 \n\nSchaeffer said Agatha All Along would follow Agatha as she is joined by \"a disparate, mixed bag of witches\" who are all coven-less, explaining that the series would explore what happens when these witches, who are \"defined by deception, treachery, villainy and selfishness\", are forced to work together. She also noted that the series plays with witch lore and assumptions about them, in a similar way to how WandaVision played with the sitcom format,[17] looking to have \"a similar mechanism and involve pastiche\" as that series did.[18] Schaeffer was able to define witchcraft within the MCU with the series. The first episode sees Agatha in a true crime drama as a detective, in an homage to the HBO miniseries Mare of Easttown (2021).[11] As Agatha and her coven travel the Witches' Road, each of its trials alters the attire of the coven to \"emulate a particular kind of witch from pop culture\": \"WASP-y east coast women in collared shirts\" which Schaeffer described as \"coastal grandma chic\" who are \"backstabbing and duplicitous\", drawing from Practical Magic (1998); a \"Fleetwood Mac-style band\" drawing from singer Stevie Nicks' \"white witch\" era and the film Season of the Witch (1972); and 1980s summer camp attire using a ouija board. The series also draws from other well-known portrayals of witches, such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Maleficent (2014), incorporating visual cues and narrative elements inspired by these films.[69] Early attempts at creating the trials were elemental based, which did not allow for the infusion of illusion or pop culture or the creativity from the costume and production design.[18]\n\nAgatha All Along is set in 2026, three years after the events of WandaVision,[70] which saw Agatha trapped in her \"Agnes\" persona by Wanda Maximoff. However, the spell has now become distorted because of Maximoff's death in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) and the Teen's intervention.[71] Following the abundance of fan theories and speculation on WandaVision that ultimately were not intended for that series, Schaeffer was more careful with her language in Agatha All Along to still be able to protect some of the series' surprises while hoping it would not create expectations in the fandom that would not come to fruition,[72] dismissing such as Thanos appearing due to his backstory with Death in the source material, with Schaeffer intending to just leave some of Death's characterization for interpretation in the show.[73]\n\nHahn was expected to reprise her role in the series with the reveal of its development in October 2021,[4] which was confirmed with the series' official announcement a month later.[3] Emma Caulfield Ford revealed in October 2022 that she would reprise her role as Sarah Proctor / \"Dottie Jones\" from WandaVision.[74] In November, Joe Locke,[75] Aubrey Plaza,[76] Ali Ahn, Maria Dizzia,[77] and Sasheer Zamata joined the cast.[78] Locke plays \"Teen\",[7] the male lead of the series,[8] while Plaza plays Rio Vidal.[76][79][80] Ahn plays the witch Alice Wu-Gulliver,[81] with Dizzia also reported to be portraying a witch,[78] and Zamata set for the recurring role of the sorceress Jennifer \"Jen\" Kale.[78][20] Patti LuPone joined the cast in December,[82] as the witch Lilia Calderu.[23] Miriam Margolyes turned down a role in the series after Marvel offered to pay her half of what she had asked for and because she did not want to film in Georgia.[54]\n\nIn January 2023, several cast members were revealed to be reprising their roles from WandaVision: Debra Jo Rupp as Sharon Davis / \"Mrs. Hart\";[15][27] David Payton as John Collins / \"Herb Feltman\"; David Lengel as Harold Proctor / \"Phil Jones\"; Asif Ali as Abilash Tandon / \"Norm Gentilucci\"; Amos Glick as a pizza delivery man / \"Dennis Webber\"; Brian Brightman as the Eastview, New Jersey, sheriff; and Kate Forbes as Agatha's mother Evanora Harkness.[26][28][27] Miles Gutierrez-Riley was cast as Teen's boyfriend,[22][26][20] with Okwui Okpokwasili also cast in the series as Salem Seven member Vertigo.[22][26] The series reveals that \"Teen\" is actually Billy Maximoff, who was previously portrayed by Julian Hilliard in WandaVision and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.[12][13]\n\nDaniel Selon served as the costume designer, after previously working as an assistant costume designer on WandaVision, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and Thor: Love and Thunder (2022).[83] John Collins was the production designer.[84] The different witches in Agatha's coven all have their own styles which were categorized by Gordon Jackson of Gizmodo as the goth, the clairvoyant, the hippie, and the \"coastal grandmother\".[85] The series end credits examines where many of the misconceptions and stereotypes about witches originated.[72]\n\nPrincipal photography began on January 17, 2023,[86][26] at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia,[87] with Schaeffer, Monteiro, and Goldberg directing episodes of the series.[26] Caleb Heymann,[88][third-party source needed] Jon Chema,[89] and Isiah Donté Lee served as cinematographers.[90] The series was filmed under the working title My Pretty.[87] Filming with Rupp also occurred in Los Angeles by February 2023, before moving to Atlanta for two months.[45] The start of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike in May 2023 was not expected to impact production of Agatha All Along, with Marvel Studios reportedly planning to shoot what they could during principal photography and make any necessary writing adjustments during the series' already scheduled reshoots.[91] Plaza filmed some of her scenes concurrent with the last two weeks of her commitments to the film Megalopolis (2024), also in Atlanta.[79] Filming took place on Blondie Street at the Warner Bros. Ranch for Agatha's house and other Westview exteriors prior to the street being demolished.[60]\n\nHahn stated that filming used as many practical elements as possible, including practical magic opposed to having it done through CGI.[92] Livano said this was done to be an homage to the golden age of fantasy and horror films, using many in-camera effects such as backdrops, miniatures, special effects, makeup effects, and creature effects. The creatives wanted Agatha All Along to elicit similar nostalgic feelings for the audience as WandaVision had with that series' homage to sitcoms.[6]: 8:54–9:16  Filming wrapped by May 28.[93] Hahn said in January 2024 there were a few days left of reshoots to take place,[94] which were completed in one day in early February.[95]\n\nJamie Gross, Libby Cuenin, Dane R.
